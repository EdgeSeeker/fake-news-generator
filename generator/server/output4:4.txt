Spicer read the statement to reporters in an off-camera White House briefing:Today’s chemical attack in Syria against innocent people, including women and children, is reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration’s weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable act.The attack on northern Idlib province, Syria has so far killed 100 and injured 400, according to a Syrian relief organization cited by the Associated Press. Another report put the death toll at 57. An initial attack appears to have been followed with airstrikes on hospitals treating those injured by the first round of the attack. Humanitarian workers on the ground have reported that the wounds of those being treated and the bodies found lifeless later on suggest the bombs made use of sarin gas, a chemical weapon prohibited by international law. Both Syria and Russia have denied responsibility for the attacks.Asked about the Administration’s position on Syria in light of comments from the Secretary of State and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Spicer said, “I think we had opportunities in the past several years to look at regime change. I think those are fundamentally–the landscape is fundamentally different than it is today.”In 2013, an attack in the Ghouta region left nearly 1,500 dead, more than 400 of which were children, and the U.S. attributed it to chemical weapons. The attack crossed the “red line” set by then-President Barack Obama, who had pledged to take action if the Syrian government used chemical weapons. Following the strike, the Obama administration accepted Assad’s claim that Syria had relinquished its chemical weapons arsenal, according to NPR.Speaking of President Donald Trump, Spicer said, “He is not here to telegraph what we’re gonna do. Rest assured that I think he has been speaking with his national security team this morning and will continue to have that discussion both internally with our national security team as well as with our allies around the globe.”“There is not a fundamental option of regime change as there has been in the past,” he told reporters, offering instead, “What we need to do is fundamentally do what we can to empower the people of Syria to find a different way.”Asked about the timing of the attack, Spicer replied, “I think the idea that someone would use chemical weapons on their own people, including women and children, is not something that any civilized nation should sit back and accept or tolerate and I think that is what we’re making very clear today.”Asked about any potential for Russian involvement, Spicer referred the reporter to the statement, which does not mention Russia, and his confidence in it. He reiterated that the President was briefed on the situation in Syria “extensively this morning by his national security team.”“We did have alternatives to regime change and they weren’t taken,” Spicer said in response to a question regarding Obama’s “red line.”Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Bashar al-Assad, chemical weapons, Obama administration, red line, Syria, White House








“I’m not, and I don’t want to be the president of the world. I’m the president of the United States, and from now on it’s going to be America first,” Trump said as the crowd of workers applauded.Trump criticized American leaders of the past for listening to “failed consultants” instead of the American worker, allowing their jobs to be shipped overseas.“Washington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves,” he said. “Now it’s your turn and you’re going to be also sharing the wealth.”Trump boasted that he stopped the Trans Pacific Partnership and would fight to renegotiate other trade deals like NAFTA that threatened American jobs. He also received applause after promoting his decision to start the Keystone pipeline.“The era of economic surrender is over,” he said.After taking the stage, Trump singled out each building union, prompting a rallying cry from each group of workers that it represented.“You’re the backbone of America, with the talent in this room, we can build any city at any time and we can build it better than anyone,” Trump said.He specifically cited the story of the Empire State Building that was constructed in just 13 months by American workers. That spirit, he asserted, would drive his economic goals going forward.The workers laughed after Trump showed a lengthy chart of regulations and permits required to construct a highway.“Nowadays you couldn’t even get a building permit or approval in that amount of time,” Trump said, promising to cut the regulations and permitting.Trump reminded them that they had a builder in the Oval Office, and urged both Democrats and Republicans to come together for a massive trillion dollar infrastructure spending bill.“Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who if given the chance can transform these communities,” he said. “You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country and I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done.”Big Government, Economics, American workers, Empire State Building, infrastructure, Keystone Pipeline, NAFTA, oval office, Trans Pacific Partnership, U.S. President Donald J Trump, union workers, wall street








The deficit fell to a seasonally adjusted $43.6 billion, lower than the $44.6 billion economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected. Exports rose 0.2 percent to $192.9 billion in February while imports declined 1.8 percent to $236.4 billion, the Department of Commerce said Tuesday.The Trump administration has made the reduction of the trade deficit one of its central economic goals, describing our persistently large trade deficits as both an economic and security risk. February’s decline makes that goal easier to achieve.Exports were boosted by improving economic conditions around the globe, as well as a rise in the value of several major currencies against the dollar. A weaker dollar makes American-made goods less expensive for foreign buyers. Exports of goods hit their highest level on record, after adjusting for inflation. Exports of services also rose. Overall, exports are 7.2 percent higher than they were a year ago.Imports declined as U.S. consumers imported fewer consumer goods such as cell phones and autos from abroad.A lower trade deficit is a boost to the economy and may raise first-quarter gross domestic product. More importantly, it likely means growth will be even stronger in the spring as manufacturers and service providers kick into higher gear and hire more workers to meet rising global demand.Trade deficits are not necessarily a sign of a weak economy. In a fast-growing economy, a large trade deficit can develop as rising wealth pulls in more imports. But when the economy is not growing fast, it can be an economic drag. Spending on exports subtracts from demand in the U.S. economy, benefitting foreign workers instead of Americans in need of good jobs. This can have big impacts on areas of the country where manufacturing is particularly important. Research has shown that the deindustrialization of the American Rust Belt is at least partly attributable to trade imbalances with China, for example.Big Government, Economics, balance of trade, China, Donald Trump, trade deficit








In a post to his Instagram account, the 54-year-old Italian designer proudly displayed the First Lady’s official portrait — released by the White House on Monday — which featured Trump wearing a D&G blazer.“BEAUTIFUL,” Gabbana captioned the photograph, adding the hashtag “#DGWoman.” #DGWoman BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤❤❤ #melaniatrump Thank you 🇺🇸❤❤❤ #madeinitaly🇹A post shared by stefanogabbana (@stefanogabbana) on Apr 4, 2017 at 2:40am PDTIt wasn’t long before the designer’s critics blasted him for taking pride in seeing his work being worn by the First Lady.“So you have lost a follower, and worst, an admirer,” one Instagram user, @_boyafraid_, wrote to the designer.“[I] dont care!! Really,” he replied.Gabbana also apparently wrote to one commenter to say, “vai a cagare,” or “go to hell” in Italian.This is not the first time the designer has taken on social media users over his show of support for the First Lady. In January, he excitedly shared a photograph of Melania Trump at the president’s New Year’s Eve party in Florida, during which she also wore a Dolce & Gabbana-designed black cocktail dress, from the company’s “Cruise” collection.“How many stupid and ignorant people r on Instagram!” Gabbana wrote in response to his critics, before telling everyone who didn’t like his posts to unfollow him.Gabbana is one of several designers — along with Tommy Hilfiger and Diane von Furstenburg — who have said they would have no problem dressing the First Lady, after a number of other marquee names in the fashion world, including Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs, have said they would not design clothing for her. Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, Dolce & Gabbana, Fashion, Melania Trump, Stefano Gabbana








Senate Republican leadership must now assemble the necessary votes for the “constitutional option” ahead of the vote on McConnell’s motion, now scheduled for Thursday, which would end debate and allow a vote of the full Senate on Gorsuch if he is to have any hope of being confirmed. At least fifty of the Senate’s fifty-two Republicans will have to sign on to change Senate rules to allow simple majority votes on cloture for Supreme Court nominees.Senate Democrats have assembled at least forty-two senators who have pledged to filibuster any effort to bring Gorsuch to a vote of the full Senate — one more than is needed to prevent a vote under current Senate rules. The Democratic filibuster was put over the top during Monday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, at which Gorsuch was approved in a party-line 11-9 vote, making the constitutional option the only likely path to confirmation.Senate rule changes can be accomplished by a simple majority. Because Vice-President Mike Pence holds the tie-breaking vote as President of the Senate, the constitutional option could be invoked if two or fewer Republican senators refuse to join the effort. If Republicans succeed Thursday in invoking cloture, the Senate would hold a vote of the full membership Friday, in which fifty-five senators — all fifty-two Republicans and three Democrats — have pledged to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the nation’s highest court.Several Republicans who had previously expressed their uncertainty or misgivings on the idea have confirmed they will back the constitutional option. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who, in the weeks before the cloture-proof filibuster took shape, was unwilling to commit to changing Senate rules, came out forcefully in favor of the constitutional option Monday night, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer he “absolutely” would support what Blitzer called the “nuclear option.”Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), who, due to his dealing with Harry Reid’s Democratic majority during the Obama Administration to preserve the filibuster, was seen as a possible holdout, gave his strongest indication yet that he is prepared to do whatever is necessary to bring Gorsuch to a vote. Tuesday afternoon he told Breitbart News:The Democrats have once again gone into a room and convinced themselves to do something that’s never been done before in the 230-year history of the Senate, and that is to require more than 51 votes to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. I have spoken on the Senate floor twice in recent weeks to try to convince Democrats not to filibuster Judge Gorsuch’s nomination because it will be damaging to the Senate and to the country. When I was in the minority, I opposed President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, but I did not support a filibuster of her nomination — I believed she was entitled to a majority vote — and Judge Gorsuch is also entitled to a majority vote.A remaining member of the “Gang of 14” senators who reached an agreement to save the sixty-vote cloture rule in 2005, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), told reporters Tuesday morning she was not committed to a repeat of that deal. “If it’s necessary in order to get him confirmed I may have to vote that way, but I certainly don’t want to,” she said about voting for the constitutional option.Fellow Gang of 14 member Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has been perhaps the most negative on the constitutional option, telling CNN that it would be a “dark day in this history of the United States’ Senate.” Even he, however, appeared resigned to the constitutional option’s likelihood. “It’s going to happen,” he said. “And it’s interesting that Republicans were dead set against it when my former colleague Harry Reid invoked it with the judges, but now it seems to be okay.”The offices of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), two Republicans who have been reluctant to endorse the constitutional option, did not respond to Breitbart News’s requests for comment.Big Government, constitutional option, Judge Neil Gorsuch, SCOTUS, Sen.

The statement is included in testimony slated for delivery on Wednesday, April 5, by Gen. John Kelly, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Typically, routine testimony is provided early to the legislators so they can prepare questions for the witness, but it is rarely leaked.According to the Associated Press:Secretary John Kelly said the steep decline in arrests is “no accident” and credited President Donald Trump’s approach to illegal immigration…In his testimony for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Kelly said fewer than 12,500 people were caught crossing the border illegally last [in March]. That compares with more than 43,000 in December.Kelly told lawmakers that the number of [Central American] families and children traveling alone — groups that accounted for hundreds of thousands of illegal border crossers in recent years — also declined steeply. Last month fewer than 1,000 children were caught at the border and fewer than 1,100 people traveling as families were found. In recent years most of the families and children traveling alone have been from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.Another report on Tuesday said the data showed a 67 percent drop in migrants seeking to cross the border.David V. Aguilar, former U.S. Border Patrol and acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that March 2017 figures he reviewed indicate illegal border crossings are down 67 percent [compared to March 2016] …. “It’s actually up to 67 percent drop compared to last year,” Aguilar told the Senate committee.During his eight-year tenure, former President Barack Obama reduced border barriers and allowed at least 300,000 migrants from Central America to cross the border and get temporary residency, plus work permits and access to Americans’ schools. That wave of migrants helped solidify public opposition to immigration, aided Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and helped cause many extra crimes in the United States.However, the flow of new illegal immigrants is only a small part of the nation’s immigrant-labor oversupply.Currently, at least 11 million illegal immigrants are living in the United States, of which at least 8 million hold jobs. Many of the recent illegal immigrants arrive legally as tourists or workers but fail to leave when their visas expire. In 2015, for example, almost 500,000 people overstayed their visas and remained for some time as illegal immigrants.Also, the federal government annually invites 1 million people to legally immigrate to the United States, and provides work permits to a shifting population of up to 1.45 million salary-cutting white-collar guest-workers, plus at least 200,000 blue-collar contract-workers. The immigrants and contract workers compete for jobs sought by the 4 million young Americans who join the workforce each year.Overall, the huge inflow of migrants, both legal and illegal, help lower Americans’ salaries and wages by roughly $500 billion per year. In turn, that money is scooped up by employers and Wall Street investors as higher profits.President Trump has promised to toughen border security by building a barrier along most of the border, and he has already directed border officers to end Obama’s “catch and release” policy. He has also rejuvenated repatriation policies and has promised to curb business’ use of temporary contract workers in place of Americans. Big Government, Economics, Immigration, Donald Trump, illegal immigration, John Kelly








In the nearly three-minute ad — titled “Live for Now Moments Anthem” — Jenner is pictured on a modeling shoot in New York City when a sizable crowd of protesters streams past holding signs and demonstrating in the streets.Soon, Jenner takes off her blonde wig and joins the protesters, who appear to be styled after anti-Donald Trump “resistance” demonstrators. The model steps through the crowd holding a can of Pepsi, which she then hands to one of the police officers watching the protest; the officer accepts the can, to the loud cheers of everyone in the streets.The advertisement spurred a widespread backlash online, particularly among progressives and social justice activists, with hundreds of social media users weighing in with mostly negative feedback as “Pepsi” began trending on Twitter Tuesday afternoon.Some critics took aim at the ad’s apparent suggestion that sharing a soda with a police officer could end racial discrimination, while others — including comedian Patton Oswalt — joked about the soda’s mythical life-saving qualities.Below is a sampling of social media reaction to the ad.A representative for Pepsi did not immediately return a request for comment.Idk how appropriation of today's protesting can be thought of as a good idea, yea just hand the cops a Pepsi and racial profiling will end!— Rory Fitzpatrick♛ (@StopRory) April 4, 2017J.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea says North Korea has fired a ballistic missile into the waters off its east coast.Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff says in a statement that the missile fired from the North’s eastern coastal town of Sinpo on Wednesday morning flew about 60 kilometers (37 miles.) It gave no further details.The firing was made as South Korean and U.S. troops were conducting annual military drills that the North views as an invasion rehearsal.North Korea often responds to the drills with its own military training and harsh rhetoric.Two weeks ago, the South Korean and U.S. militaries said they detected what they called a failed North Korean ballistic missile launch.Big Government

Maybe the best chance Republicans have to enact meaningful legislation is to focus on issues that unite the Party. Since the Reagan Revolution, one area that has consistently united Republicans is a commitment to liberate the American people from the burden of hefty taxation and a desire to allow free markets – not tax policy – to drive the American economy.While much of the focus on tax reform has been on the corporate side, another problematic area has that has gotten far less attention is the use of tax incentives to support the “green” energy business. In my opinion, there are no worse examples of tax policy then these incentives because they adulterate the free market and often direct massive profits to the wealthy and politically connected.One tax policy that is ripe for fixing is the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC). The ITC currently allows homeowners and businesses to deduct a portion of the cost of installation of solar panels until 2021. In 2015, Congress approved this tax cut in a deal with the Obama White House. What bothers me is that the implementation of the ITC means that Americans who do not choose to put solar panels on their rooftops have to subsidize those that do. Also, it turns out that taxpayers are also subsidizing some of the wealthiest people on the planet.Consider Elon Musk, the owner of SolarCity – which recently merged into his other company, Tesla – is the largest provider of residential solar panels in the nation. Musk is the 87th richest man in the world and someone worth admiring for his financial successes that have created thousands of jobs. However, I am not supportive of tax policies like the ITC that put more money in the pockets of billionaires.Another government incentive that Elon Musk benefits from is the Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) tax credit. This policy allows people who purchase electronic/plug in vehicles to deduct $7,500 from their federal taxes. This credit phases out after any manufacturer sells 20,000 qualified vehicles. The only automaker even coming close to this 20,000 threshold is Tesla and Elon Musk.Now, Musk has publicly said he does not support the ZEV, stating on a recent earnings call: “the reality actually is that, if electric vehicle incentives went away tomorrow, Tesla’s competitive position would improve.” If Musk can’t have the tax credit much longer, he doesn’t want his competitors to have it either. So Musk uses the tax credit to get a leg up and then wants to eliminate it to punish his competitors when he can’t get it anymore? Oddly enough, the only profitable quarter Tesla has seen in a long time was selling $139 million in pollution tax credits to other automakers.To me, the lesson of Elon Musk – who, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times in May of 2015, has been the beneficiary of almost $5 billion dollars in government subsidies – is that these green tax credits allow businesses to subvert the free-market to their own advantage. I don’t blame Musk, nor is this piece meant to be a critique of him. The business world is a tough place, and competitors need to seek out any advantage they can get. I just don’t think the American tax code should be a tool used by corporate titans to gain leverage or advantage over each other.

The median annual salary for male staffers in Warren’s office amounted to $73,750 in 2016, while female staffers brought in a median of $52,750 in 2016 — a pay gap amounting to more than $20,000, the Washington Free Beacon reported.Female staff in Warren’s office make 71 cents for every dollar that their male counterparts make.The top five highest paid staffers in Warren’s office were all men who earned between $113,750 and $156,000, while only one woman earned a salary of more than $100,000 in 2016.Warren frequently champions equal pay for women on both her personal and Senate Twitter accounts.“I cannot believe I have to give another speech fighting for equal pay for equal work for women,” she wrote in one of her tweets from her Senate account.Warren is not the only politician who touts equal pay and then pays women less than men.Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton paid women about $15,000 less than men as a senator, then paid women $16,000 less than men as secretary of state, and paid women $7,000 less as a presidential candidate. Campaign staffers noted her campaign’s tendency to pay men more than women and saw it as a vulnerability in the election.Women working at the Obama White House also regularly earned less than men.Big Government, Economics, Pre-Viral, equal pay, female staffers, male staffers, pay gap, Sen.

David V. Aguilar, former U.S. Border Patrol and acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that March 2017 figures he reviewed indicate illegal border crossings are down 67 percent, according to The Washington Times. By comparison, February statistics indicating the number of illegal alien apprehensions fell 40 percent.“It’s actually up to 67 percent drop compared to last year,” Aguilar told the Senate committee.The former Border Patrol chief explained that similar decreases occurred during the Reagan Administration but later spiked in the decades to follow.Mr. Aguilar’s Capitol Hill comments were not immediately verified by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The retired law enforcer’s statement does, however, follow news previously reported by Breitbart Texas related to the mothballing of temporary holding facilities for the pre-election surge of migrants throughout 2016. In mid-February, a Rio Grande Valley Sector facility near the Donna-Rio Bravo International Bridge was closed after the prior month’s Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) and Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) border apprehensions exhibited double-digit tumbles. Days later, Breitbart Texas reported on a second overflow facility closure located about 40 miles east of El Paso. Both plants were placed in “warm standby” status capable of reversal in less than 24 hours.March 2017 figures have not yet been released by CBP.Logan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

Lacker’s role in the 2012 leak of sensitive information to an analyst at Medley Global Advisors came to light as part of a federal investigation. His resignation comes as part of a deal worked out with investigators, a person familiar with the matter said.“Once our Bank’s Board of Directors learned of the outcome of the government investigations, they took appropriate actions,” the Richmond Fed said.“I deeply regret the role I may have played in confirming this confidential information and its dissemination to Medley’s subscribers,” Lacker said.Lacker, who has been the head of the Richmond Fed for 13 years, stopped short of admitting that he was the source of the information and said that it was not his intention to reveal confidential information in his conversation with the analyst.  CNBC’s Steve Liesman reported Tuesday afternoon that an attorney for Lacker said that federal authorities have said no charges will be filed against his client.Medley disclosed to its clients previously unknown details about the Fed’s plans for the third round of asset purchases, known as QE3, according to sources familiar with the matter.  The leak has been under investigation internally by the Fed, by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York ,and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The federal prosecutors and CFTC have been investigating possible insider-trading in connection with the leaks.Lacker said that the analyst brought up an “important non-public detail” about the Fed’s plans. Instead of ending the call, Lacker continued the conversation. The following day, Medley published its report containing the sensitive information.It remains unclear how the Medley analyst originally obtained the information that Lacker says he confirmed. But the report was so detailed that it left little doubt it was based on non-public information.The report came after the Fed announced in September 2012 its plans to attempt to boost economic growth by buying $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities each month.Medley’s October 3rd report said Fed officials had discussed adding monthly purchases $45 billion of Treasury bonds, a policy which the Fed didn’t announce until the following December. It also said that Fed officials had discussed assuring market actors that the central bank wouldn’t consider raising interest rates until unemployment fell below 6.5% or the medium-term outlook for inflation rose above 2.5%. Those numerical triggers weren’t formally adopted by the Fed until later that year.Other intriguing details from the Medley report include a report that staff members were working past midnight to prepare for the central bank’s meeting and that the minutes from the meeting would include a reference to a staff meeting. Those minutes were published by the Fed the day after Medley’s report.In addition to admitting that he confirmed some of the Medley analysts non-public information, Lacker also said that he did not initially tell the Fed’s investigators that the analyst was in possession of that information during the call. Instead, he only disclosed this fact in 2015 when he was interviewed as part of the investigation by federal prosecutors, the CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.“I regret that in this instance I crossed the line to confirming information that should have remained confidential,” Lacker said.Lacker had previously announced his intention to retire this fall. Under the Fed’s rotating schedule, the Richmond Fed president will not become a voting member of the 12-person interest rate setting board until 2018.Lacker has been an advocate for the Fed to adopt a faster pace of rate hikes. He has dissented over a dozen times to the Fed’s interest rate decisions during his term, consistently arguing for a less accommodative monetary policy stance. He opposed the use of the Fed’s balance sheet to buy mortgage bonds during the financial crisis.  Big Government, Economics, Federal Reserve








Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) called on former National Security Advisor Susan Rice to be brought in front of Congress under subpoena and asked questions about allegations she was behind the unmasking of American identities in raw surveillance.Paul also said she should be asked about former President Barack Obama’s knowledge of these alleged activities.“For years, both progressives and libertarians have been complaining about these backdoor searches,” Paul said. “It’s not that we’re searching maybe one foreign leader and who they talk to; we search everything in the whole world. There were reports a couple of years ago that all of Italy’s phone calls were absorbed in a one month period of time. We were getting Merkel’s phone calls; we were getting everybody’s phone calls. But by rebound we are collecting millions of Americans phone calls. If you want to look at an American’s phone call or listen to it, you should have to have a warrant, the old fashioned way in a real court where both sides get represented.”“But a secret warrant by a secret court with a lower standard level because we’re afraid of terrorism is one thing for foreigners but both myself and a Progressive Ron Wyden have been warning about these back door searches for years and that they could be politicized,” he continued. “The facts will come out with Susan Rice. But I think she ought to be under subpoena. She should be asked did you talk to the president about it? Did President Obama know about this? So this is actually, eerily similar to what Trump accused them of which is eavesdropping on conversations for political reasons.”Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBreitbart TV, Morning Joe, MSNBC, Rand Paul, Susan Rice

Washington (AFP) – The US military confirmed Tuesday that nuclear-armed North Korea had fired a medium-range ballistic missile, finding it posed no threat to North America and vowing to work closely with its regional allies.“US Pacific Command is fully committed to working closely with our Republic of Korea and Japanese allies to maintain security,” the command in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region said.“The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.”








Official statistics say that three out of 10 aircraft in the Air Force fleet are not in commission because they are getting upgraded, undergoing maintenance, inspections, or heavy-duty repair work, the Air Force Times reports.The problem also shows no sign of slowing down. The mission-capable rate, or the way the Air Force measures how much its fleet is ready to fight or fly other measures, has been showing a steady decrease.Mission-capable rates for Air Force helicopters and airplanes were at nearly 74 percent in 2014. In 2015, the rate dropped to 73 percent, and in 2016 the rate dropped to 72 percent.The reason for this decline in mission-ready aircraft is due to an aging Air Force fleet.Air Force leaders have said that the Air Force’s aging fleet and decline in readiness rates have been a problem for years.“Our highest investment priority is in improving readiness,” acting Air Force Secretary Lisa Disbrow said March 3 at the Air Force Association’s Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida. “The aircraft we have on the ramp are too old. We need to revitalize the fleet.”The declining aircraft readiness rate can also be attributed to a shortage of experienced maintenance airmen to fix aircraft, although the Air Force wants to make its goal to eliminate that shortfall by the end of 2019.While the Air Force is dealing with an aging fleet on Earth, they are also training airmen for the possibility of war waged in space, Military.com reported.Big Government, National Security, Pre-Viral, Air Force, aircraft, flying condition, mission capable rate








NEW YORK (AP) — Congresswoman Clinton? President Clinton? For now, Chelsea Clinton says her only plan is to burnish her profile as an author of children’s books.The former first daughter embarked on a six-state book tour Tuesday that was scheduled back when she believed her mother was on the way to the White House.There has been no internal polling, no private discussions with political consultants. No one scheduled the tour — to promote the paperback release of “It’s Your World,” a book aimed at middle-school students — thinking it would be an effective vehicle to launch a serious political run. She is also preparing to release an illustrated children’s book in May that celebrates female leaders.“There’s lots of TBDs in Chelsea’s future,” Clinton chief of staff Bari Lurie told The Associated Press, using the acronym for “to be determined.” ”But right now she’s very clear: One of those TBDs is not running for office.”Still, with Hillary Clinton’s political career possibly over following a devastating election loss, people can’t stop speculating about whether her daughter intends to take up the family business.Chelsea Clinton was blunt in a Tuesday interview with “CBS This Morning,” but also left the door open.“No, no, no,” Clinton said, noting that she’s pleased with her state and local public officials in New York City.“I clearly don’t agree with our president, but I’m definitely not the right person to run to defeat him in 2020,” she continued. “So right now, the answer is no. But I think we all need to be asking ourselves that question periodically.”Asked whether a run for office is inevitable because her parents were both politicians, Chelsea Clinton, 37, would only say that people should be willing to fight for programs and policies they believe in. She said, “I hope that politics is in all of our DNA.”The comments come as her mother’s political standing reaches new lows. In December, more than 60 percent of Democrats and independents said Hillary Clinton should not run again for office, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll.Political operatives in New York say that Chelsea Clinton, who lives in Manhattan, may have more options than her mother’s poor numbers suggest.“The brand here is still pretty strong,” said Jefrey Pollock, a New York-based Democratic pollster, referring to liberal New York City and its suburbs. “For right now, if there’s a future, it’s going to be something more local than national.”Chelsea Clinton continues to serve as vice chairwoman of the board at the Clinton Foundation, an unpaid position that puts her at the center of decisions about the foundation’s future. Among other responsibilities, she plays an active role in fundraising, promotion and program evaluation.She is also teaching a class on global health governance at Columbia University and recently joined the board of the internet travel site Expedia.And she is eager to speak out against President Donald Trump’s policies.Late last week, she warned during a televised fundraiser for the American Civil Liberties Union that Republican-backed voter ID laws are threatening the right to vote.Over the weekend, she tweeted a link to the Los Angeles Times headline: “Our Dishonest President.” And on Monday, she posted a message to her 1.6 million Twitter followers highlighting the Trump administration’s plan to cut funding at the Environmental Protection Agency.“She’s made it very clear: ‘I can care deeply and fight for issues I’m passionate about and not be running for public office,” Lurie said.

Bigz arrived from Uganda in 2009 teeming with ambitions as big as his heart.Shortly after reaching U.S. soil, he became involved with the National Prayer Breakfast, where he mentored inner-city kids from broken homes. Bigz showed God’s love for them and how they could grow up with integrity, responsibility, and self-esteem no matter where they came from.By 2011, Bigz had been recruited for a position at the Washington Bible College, where he continued to mentor an even larger number of kids.It was on a chance trip to Kenya where he rekindled his relationship with Kate, a good friend he met while attending college in Uganda.They soon realized that the love they felt for one another went beyond a friendship, and in 2014, Bigz and Kate were married.Bigz always dreamed of having a large, loving family with whom to share in his ambitions and good fortune.In an effort to realize his American dream, Bigz began working with the Breitbart team in 2013. The Uganda immigrant was considered an essential member of the Breitbart family, helping organize company events, meetings, and gatherings. He was always there and always with a smile on his face. He was on his way to achieving his American dream.Unfortunately, the unthinkable happened on December 2015 when Kate, just six months after giving birth to a beautiful baby girl named Nancy, was diagnosed with cancer.After initial rounds of therapy, the cancer went in to remission, allowing Kate some valuable and unforgettable time with her newborn and husband.The happiness was short lived. In September of last year, the cancer came back and ultimately took her life this past weekend.His infectious good nature, love of God, and his baby daughter continue to grace our extended family. It is with heavy hearts that we join together with Bigz and his loved ones in offering our deepest sympathy.You can learn more about Bigz and his family at his GoFundMe page, which the family has set up to help defray the costs of reuniting Kate back with her family in Uganda where she can be laid to rest with her ancestors.Big Government, Breitbart News








Apparently, being in sole control of one of the quarter-billion aluminum shells hurtling at high speed on America’s roads isn’t enough to hold drivers’ attention. Traffic deaths have jumped by 14% since 2014, according to Cambridge Mobile Telematics, which conducted the study. The research firm found that 52% of accidents involved drivers who were distracted by their phones.Anti-cell phone use while driving laws have done little to curb the habits of its citizens. Only fourteen states have banned handheld use of phones while driving, and only twenty prohibit phone use by school bus drivers; a single state bans bus drivers from texting.But Cambridge Mobile Telematics’ Chief Technology Officer, Hari Balakrishnan, has hope:Distracted driving due to smartphone use is intuitively blamed for the increase in road crashes and claims. What’s less intuitive is that smartphones hold the solution to the problem they created. Drivers now have access to tools that analyze their driving and achieve real behavioral change through immediate and ongoing feedback.Balakrishnan called distracted driving “one of the most urgent public safety problems facing our communities today” and stressed the importance of taking a “critical look at how we can most effectively reduce the danger that drivers face.”CMT is working to do their part. Their DriveWell app both monitors drivers and encourages safer driving habits. The site claims that “users see an average reduction of 35% in phone distraction, 20% in hard braking, and 20% in at-risk speeding all within less than 30 days of using the program.”Their goals are best summed up by Balakrishnan himself: “By harnessing the very technology that threatens driver safety, and using it to help drivers understand and improve their behavior, we’re making the world safer by the day.”Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.Pre-Viral, Tech, Cambridge Mobile Telematics, distracted driving








The new rules come after years of fans and customers complaining that ESPN has become a bastion of left-wing views delivered at the expense of sports, and to the utter exclusion of any conservative ideas.While in some cases it appears the new rules do offer a little wiggle room for on-air talent, the rules seem to be aimed at tamping down the wild spouting on political topics its hosts have indulged for the last few years. It is also interesting that ESPN released these new guidelines right in the middle of the NCAA Championship game when fans were distracted by the tournament and might not have taken notice of the change. It is almost like the practice of dumping political news on a Friday evening in the hopes that it might make fewer waves because all the reporters have already gone home for the weekend.ESPN’s vice president of global digital content, Patrick Stiegman, noted that the rise of social media and the many controversies that on-air talent recently stirred via Twitter and Facebook was a major reason for the new guidelines.“We have the convergence of a politically charged environment and all these new technologies coming together at once,” Stiegman told ESPN’s Jim Brady. “Based on that, we wanted the policy to reflect the reality of the world today. There are people talking about politics in ways we have not seen before, and we’re not immune from that.”Brady, also ESPN’s ombudsman, addressed complaints from fans that the network has become too political in a long article published last November. Brady made to investigate the claims that his network had become infected with liberal politics, and at that time concluded that was not the case.Despite Brady’s obviously skewed “investigation” from November, it now appears that the network has accepted the charge that it has become too political.Some of the changes include a proscription against political advocacy, including the one that states, “Original news reports should not include statements of support, opposition or partisanship related to any social issue, political position, candidate or office holder.” The rules also both directly and indirectly mention social media, stating, “Writers, reporters, producers and editors directly involved in ‘hard’ news reporting, investigative or enterprise assignments and related coverage should refrain in any public-facing forum from taking positions on political or social issues, candidates or office holders.”By “public-facing forum,” the network means social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Indeed, later in the new policy, it directly notes that the new rules apply to “ESPN, Twitter, Facebook and other media.”The new guidelines also inform hosts that any interviews with candidates will have to be cleared by executives so that “balance” can be assessed. It also says that presentations must be balanced, stating “The presentation should be thoughtful and respectful. We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.”The new rules could act to temper the extreme liberalism in which hosts have routinely indulged. But, it remains to be seen if the network will stick to the policy if the left-wing commentary goes on unabated. After all, it should be noted that the network had rules similar to these before and it neither calmed the on-air liberal outbursts nor did the rules form the basis for any punishment of violations of anyone spouting liberal political views.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Breitbart Sports, ESPN, Jim Brady








The win, announced April 4, came when the NCAA’s university leaders “reluctantly voted” to end its boycott of the state, which began when the North Carolina legislature passed a law in March 2016 which reaffirmed the long-standing practice of keeping separate public bathrooms for men and women. Last week, the state legislature eliminated the 2016 law but passed a new law, HB142, which preserves the legality of single-sex bathrooms and shower rooms. According to the NCAA statement, We are actively determining site selections [for future sports events], and this new law has minimally achieved a situation where we believe NCAA championships may be conducted in a nondiscriminatory environment [in N.C.] … If we find that our expectations of a discrimination-free environment are not met, we will not hesitate to take necessary action at any time.Gay and transgender groups complained bitterly about their defeat, which happened despite loud and economically powerful support from left-wing university leaders, and from wealthy business interests in California, New York, and other far-left states. According to a statement from Equality NC:“It is disappointing to see the NCAA backpedal after it stood strong against the deeply discriminatory HB2,” said Equality NC Executive Director Chris Sgro. “HB142 continues the same discriminatory scheme put forward by HB2 and does little to protect the NCAA’s players, employees, and fans. The NCAA’s decision has put a seal of approval on state-sanctioned discrimination.”“The NCAA’s decision to backtrack on their vow to protect LGBTQ players, employees and fans is deeply disappointing and puts people at risk,” said [Human Rights Council] President Chad Griffin. “After drawing a line in the sand and calling for repeal of HB2, the NCAA simply let North Carolina lawmakers off the hook.The transgender groups did gain one concession from the NCAA, which promised to keep the issue alive by demanding updates from N.C. sports officials.  “The board, however, directs that any site awarded a championship event in North Carolina or elsewhere be required to submit additional documentation demonstrating how student-athletes and fans will be protected from discrimination,” said the NCAA statement.The NCAA’s retreat and the resulting defeat of the gay lobby is a big win for voters and legislators around the country who wish to block the effort by “gender identity” activists to eliminate legal and civic distinctions between the equal, popular and complementary preferences of men and women, such as single-sex bathrooms. In many other states, Democratic legislators and business leaders frequently cite the threat of N.C.-like economic boycotts to oppose legislation that recognizes and affirms the difference between men and women.In general, gay and transgender activists are trying to impose a “‘genderless society” on Americans, in which the government would encourage damaging lawsuits against any facility or group that recognizes the differences between the two sexes.Their state-by-state political campaign is aided by favorable media, by wealthy donors who fund lawsuits against schools and sports leagues, and by out-of-state business interests which threaten economic sanctions against states which try to preserve single-sex groups and facilities. Also, the transgender groups are aided by sympathetic judges who have the legal power to impose the “Gender Identity” ideology via civil rights law. The N.C. defeat won’t stop the ideological push, but likely will help Americans contain or roll it back in many states.The North Carolina dispute began in February 2016 when the city of Charlotte said men and women could use either bathroom according to their chosen “gender identity.” Also, the city ordinance did not require people to prove their “gender identity,” effectively allowing men to use women’s bathrooms and shower rooms if they simply declare a female “gender identity.”Nationwide, only about one-in-four voters support the “gender identity” ideology. Also, there are very few people who wish to live as members of the opposite sex, with estimates ranging from a high of one-in-130 Americans down to one-in-2,400 Americans.In March 2016, GOP legislators defeated the Charlotteville challenge by passing HB2, titled the “Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act.” The popular law affirmed the recognition of sexual differences between men and women, it limited cities’ ability to impose social legislation on citizens, it protected sexual privacy in shared public bathrooms, and it reaffirmed long-standing rules for how people can switch their legal sex after medical procedures. Gay and progressive groups, aided by the established media, then organized a year-long national campaign against the HB2 law.For example, they persuaded their allies in companies and universities to withdraw investment and sports tournaments from the state. The economic threat, although only partly effective, helped the 2016 defeat of the GOP’s effective governor, Pat McCrory. The anti-HB2 campaign failed, but according to one 2016 supporter, President Barack Obama, it helped defeat Hillary Clinton by distracting public recognition of economic improvements. However, the business pressure also pushed GOP leaders to approval the compromise HB142 deal with the new Democratic governor, Roy Cooper.HB142 is a stripped-down version of the HB2 bill, and it permanently preserves the state’s ability to set rules for single-sex bathrooms. After November 2020, cities and counties will regain some powers to write new legal rights for gays and for “transgender” people who want to live as members of the opposite sex, ensuring renewed political fights over the role of the “gender,” and over distinctions between the male and female sexes.The “gender identity” advocates slammed the HB142 law: Last Thursday, the North Carolina General Assembly and Governor Roy Cooper (pictured) passed an egregious bill — HB142 — that keeps some of the most discriminatory provisions of HB2 alive. Under this new “HB2.0,” which replaces one discriminatory, anti-transgender bathroom bill with another, the North Carolina General Assembly reserves total control over bathroom access throughout the state to itself; that means no city, state agency, public university or school board can ever adopt a policy that ensures transgender people have access to restrooms consistent with their gender identity.  Further, no city can even consider passing any protections for LGBTQ people until 2020. At the end of this discriminatory “moratorium,” cities will still be prevented from ensuring transgender people are able to use facilities consistent with their gender identity. Conservatives leaders are downplaying their success, partly because they are trying to avoid a resurgence of the economic embargo by left-wing business leaders. For example, the statement from the NC Values Coalition applauded the NCAA”s decision but decried the economic embargo. The statement by Executive Director Tami Fitzgerald said:NC Values Coalition is pleased that the NCAA Board of Governors has decided to end their boycott and lobbying efforts against our State and are now including North Carolina bids to host future NCAA Championship events through 2022. The NCAA’s boycott of North Carolina achieved what it wanted—the repeal of HB2—proving that bullying works as long as you meet the demands of the bully; however, the NCAA had no business demanding anything of North Carolina lawmakers.  Nondiscrimination laws in North Carolina—even under HB2—have always been similar to 29 other states and 10,000 other multiplicities.The North Carolina win for Americans may help similar sex-affirmation, anti-transgender fights underway in Texas and many other states. To read more about the “gender identity” ideology, click here and here. Big Government, hb142, HB2, North Carolina, pat mccrory, Transgender








Until Tuesday the NCAA remained quiet about whether or not it would allow NC to regain permission to host the games. The Tar Heel state lost its privilege as a destination for games in 2016 when it decreed under the law HB2 that all people, including transgenders, have to use bathrooms corresponding to their biological gender as indicated on their birth certificate. Many advocates for transgender rights believe the repeal of HB2, and replacing it with HB142, does not go far enough to protect the rights of transexuals.The new law essentially restores the status quo prior to HB2. However,  HB-142 prohibits government entities from creating laws that pertain to multiple-occupancy bathrooms, showers, and changing rooms unless it’s “in accordance with an act of the General Assembly.” The new law only applies until December 1, 2020.According to The Washington Times, the NCAA called HB142 “far from perfect,” but “meets the minimal NCAA requirements,” therefore allowing them to lift the boycott of championship games.“We are actively determining site selections, and this new law has minimally achieved a situation where we believe NCAA championships may be conducted in a nondiscriminatory environment,” the NCAA said in a statement. “If we find that our expectations of a discrimination-free environment are not met, we will not hesitate to take necessary action at any time.”Pro-LGBT advocacy groups were not happy with the NCAA’s decision. “What a sell-out,” Lambda Legal tweeted, after hearing the news. “The NCAA’s decision to backtrack on their vow to protect LGBTQ players, employees and fans is deeply disappointing and puts people at risk.” Chad Griffin, president of Human Rights Campaign responded, “After drawing a line in the sand and calling for repeal of HB2, the NCAA simply let North Carolina lawmakers off the hook.”So far the NBA has not stated whether HB142 meets their minimum standards for holding all-star games in NC in the future. In February, the NBA relocated its All-Star Weekend, which was scheduled for Charlotte, and moved it to New Orleans as a protest to HB2.Breitbart Sports, HB 2, HB-142, NCAA








“I think it’s an issue which deeply concerns people like myself and other people, working-level officers in the intel community,” Uehlinger said. “Even though at this point, there seems to be no evidence of breaking the law, this ‘unmasking’ of people was ill-advised at best. I think it really shows that abuse of power and the fact that many people in the Obama administration were willing to violate the spirit of the laws designed to protect Americans, perhaps rather than the law itself.”LISTEN:“As a working-level CIA officer, we were always told by upper authority, you’re always told to – and the quote is – ‘avoid the appearance of impropriety,’” he said. “Well, this does not pass that smell test, definitely.”Uehlinger said another thing that concerns working-level officers in the intelligence and military communities is “the American people, average Americans like myself, are tired of seeing two sets of rules followed by the higher-ups and then the working-level people.”“This is just part of that again. A working-level officer would have gotten into big trouble doing anything remotely like this,” he observed. “But now, we have a lot of people saying that she should just be given a pass.”“While I understand, you know, it’s important that the Trump administration has to move forward with its domestic agenda, but these allegations demand to be further investigated,” he urged.Kassam proposed that Democrats and their media would not allow the Trump administration to move forward with any part of its agenda until this “Russia hysteria” is cleaned up. That will be a difficult task since, as Kassam noted, the hysteria has been burning at fever pitch for months without a shred of evidence to back up the wildest allegations.Uehlinger agreed and addressed Kassam’s point that media coverage alternates between “no surveillance was conducted” and “we know everything about Trump’s Russia connections.”“The Obama administration relaxed the rule that allowed raw intelligence that was gathered by the NSA to be shared throughout the government,” he pointed out. “First of all, to relax that, there is absolutely no operational justification for doing that. With all of the counter-intelligence problems, with espionage, with Snowden, all these things we’ve had, to raise by an order of magnitude the access to this very sensitive information makes no operational sense at all.” “So for someone to approve that, it’s clear they had another intent, and I believe the intent was to allow for further leakage,” he charged. “To give more people access, thus more leaks, which, in fact, would hurt the Trump administration. It seems very obvious when you put that together and combine it with the actions of Susan Rice and other people in unmasking people. That is the true purpose behind this.” “I say this as somebody who – you have to remember, when I was a station chief overseas, this is what I was reporting on. I was in countries like Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kosovo – countries which constantly had the offices of the prime minister or president using the intelligence services to suppress the domestic opposition. So I’ve been to this rodeo before, many a time. I saw the storm clouds gathering several weeks ago, and everything I’ve suspected has so far come to fruition,” Uehlinger said.He pronounced it “very disappointing” that such transparent abuse of government power for partisan politics would occur in the United States.“An intelligence service has to have the trust of the people and the government in order to function effectively,” he said. “With all of these scandals happening, and with the name of perhaps the CIA and other intelligence community elements in the mud, this makes the object of protecting our national security more problematic. The agencies have to have the trust of the American people, and they’re losing it, because it seems as though they’ve been weaponized –  perhaps, like I said, not breaking the law but playing very close to the line.”Kassam suggested that leaking the information might have been illegal, even if Rice was legally entitled to request information on Donald Trump’s campaign and unmask the U.S. persons monitored during surveillance of foreign intelligence targets.“That’s absolutely the case,” Uehlinger agreed. He went on to argue that the absence of hard evidence for any wrongdoing by the Trump campaign in all of these leaks was highly significant.“Since basically the Obama administration has sort of loaded this with these rule changes and all to allow for leaks the fact that there is no ‘smoking gun’ of Trump administration collusion with Russia indicates that there isn’t any. There is nothing substantial here because a juicy morsel like that would certainly have been leaked by the same people that have been leaking everything else. The fact it hasn’t been leaked out means it does not exist,” he reasoned.Kassam said some of the Russia hysteria came from imputing sinister motives to conventional business dealings, arguing that Trump’s organization made deals around the world, and it is exceedingly difficult to do business with any Russian entity that is not somehow connected to the Russian government.“That’s an excellent point. You’re absolutely right,” Uehlinger responded. “It shows these people who are doing these gambits are relying on the relative ignorance of the American public of the actual nuts and bolts of intelligence to make their point. Anyone with any background in this stuff can see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to discredit an administration because they were crushed in the past elections.”Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Listen to the complete audio of the interview above.Big Government, National Security, Radio, 2016 election, Breitbart News Daily, Donald Trump, intelligence community, Russia, Susan Rice, unmasking








The recent reports further prove, at least in part, President Donald Trump’s claims that senior Obama officials had collected intelligence on Trump aids and disseminated it throughout the government. Rice’s involvement — as it relates to her reported role in the unmasking of Trump aids and circulating sensitive information — places the longtime Obama operative at the center of another major political scandal.Below are five facts from Susan Rice scandals every American should know.1. Susan Rice allegedly ordered surveillance of Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign aides as part of a political intelligence operation. Rice allegedly maintained spreadsheets of Trump aides’ telephone calls “one year before the 2016 presidential election,” according to the Daily Caller.The Daily Caller reports:“What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday.“The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls.”2. Rice claimed that climate change was responsible for the deadly civil war in Syria. “In the years prior to civil war breaking out in Syria, that country also experienced its worst drought on record,” Rice said in October 2015, during a speech at Stanford University. “Farming families moved en masse into urban centers, increasing political unrest and further priming the country for conflict.”Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed in the conflict since President Barack Obama drew his infamous “red line” in 2012, promising to retaliate against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime if it used chemical weapons on its own people.3. Rice once declared that there is “no military solution” to the raging conflict in Yemen.“As in Syria, there is no military solution to the crisis in Yemen,” Rice said in April 2015, during a speech at the Arab American Institute’s Kahlil Gibran Gala.Seven months before Rice’s speech, President Obama had called his administration’s drone strike-driven military operation in Yemen a success story.President Trump, however, ordered more airstrikes against al-Qaeda in Yemen in February than any year in Obama’s presidency.4. Susan Rice said accused deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl served “with honor and distinction.”In March 2015, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was charged with treason for allegedly deserting his fellow soldiers and abandoning his Afghanistan outpost in 2009.In a June 2014 broadcast of ABC’s This Week, Susan Rice defended Bergdahl, saying he “served the United States with honor and distinction. And we’ll have the opportunity eventually to learn what has transpired in the past years.”As Breitbart News reported, six soldiers lost their lives searching for then-Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl after he abandoned his outpost.5. Susan Rice was the driving force behind a misinformation campaign about the Sept. 11, 2012, Benghazi terror attacks. Then-UN Ambassador Rice, acting as the Obama White House’s spokeswoman, appeared on five Sunday morning talk shows and repeatedly claimed that the Benghazi attacks had been caused by an anti-Islam video.Rice appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, and CNN and regurgitated talking points purporting that the protests that had erupted “spontaneously” near two U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya and were a result of a “hateful video” that was offensive to Islam.But government documents, released following a Judicial Watch lawsuit, reveal that government officials monitoring the attack in real-time did not cite an anti-Islam video as an explanation for the paramilitary attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi.In May 2015 interview, former Obama CIA Director Mike Morell said Rice’s Benghazi talking points blaming an anti-Islam YouTube video crossed “the line between national security and politics.”“I think the line in there that says one of our objectives here right on the Sunday show is to blame the video rather than a failure of policy,” Morell said on Fox News’ Special Report. “And as you know, I say in the book that I think that that is crossing the line between national security and politics.”Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudsonBig Government, Pre-Viral, barack obama, Big Government, Daily Caller, Intelligence, national security, spreadsheets, surveillance, Susan Rice, Syria, wiretapping

Monday on “CNN Tonight,” host Don Lemon explained the report that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice unmasked members of the Trump transition team as a “diversion.”“[L]et us be very clear about this,” Lemon stated. “There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump team was spied on illegally. There is no evidence that backs up the president’s original claim. On this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise, nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion.”Follow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideoBreitbart TV, CNN, Don Lemon, Donald Trump, Susan Rice








Monday on “Anderson Cooper 360,” CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto called a report that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice was behind the unmasking of identities of members of the Trump transition team in surveillance of foreign officials to be a distraction from a larger investigation of the Trump administration.According to what Sciutto described as a “source,” those allegations aimed at Rice were false, which is what Sciutto based his claim of this being a distraction.Partial transcript as follows:Well, just a short time ago, I spoke with someone close to Ambassador Rice, and this is the first comments from someone close to Rice today on these allegations. I’ll read it in quotes.“The idea that Ambassador Rice improperly sought the identities of Americans is false. There is nothing unusual about making these requests when serving as a senior national security official, whether Democrat or Republican.” That coming from someone who works for Ambassador Rice.But let’s go beyond that, because I spoke today with senior — former senior U.S. intelligence officials, the senior most who served both Republican and Democratic administrations, and this is what they have told me about this story.They said, “One, this is not unusual. This happens. When you are briefed on intelligence communications like this, sometimes senior national security officials can ask the intelligence community to identify the Americans either mentioned in those conversations or on the other side of those phone calls. It’s not up to that senior U.S. national security official to make that decision, it’s then up to the intelligence agencies, the NSA, they decide what’s appropriate to then unmask for that senior official. It is legal. There are protocols that have been put in place since 9/11 to allow this to happen.”And I’m told, this very meticulously logged, someone said to me, described it, it’s like Catholic baptismal records. It’s so well- logged. You can’t do this in secret and you have to do it without the approval of the intelligence community.And, finally, Anderson, I would just say, why would someone do this? Every day, they’re getting briefings on intelligence. Their briefer chooses what they are briefed on, including Ambassador Rice, in those briefings, an official such as Rice might say, to further understand it, I would like to know who those names are. And that’s why they would make that request, which then as I said would have to be approved by the intelligence community.That’s what I’m told. And again to note by senior intelligence officials who work for both Democrats and Republicans. This appears to be a story, largely ginned up, partly as a distraction from this larger investigation.But I will say, Anderson, you’re aware of this, the investigations continue, but particularly on the House side, there are now questions coming from both Democrats and Republicans about how bipartisan this investigation can be.(h/t Daily Caller)Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBreitbart TV, Anderson Cooper, CNN, Jim Sciutto, Susan Rice, wiretapping








From AdWeek:Asked what one word best describes Breitbart’s tenacious political coverage, the site’s political editor echoes none other than Dan Rather. “Courageous,” says Matthew Boyle, who joined Breitbart in 2012 from The Daily Caller. Of Boyle’s work ethos, Breitbart editor in chief Alex Marlow has said he “typifies the ‘fighting spirit’ we value.”In August, Boyle called out the media on Fox’s Sean Hannity Show for “100 percent using” fallen Muslim-American solider U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan and his family “for their political goals.” “We don’t take orders from anyone except ourselves on what we think we should be focused on,” says Boyle, who worked closely with former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon, now Trump’s chief strategist. “Steve is a friend and my old boss, and I’ve learned so much from him,” Boyle notes. “He’s an incredibly smart person and I talk to him on occasion, as any good journalist would do, trying to get information out of newsworthy sources.” Boyle says he plans to be in the business “for a long time” for one simple reason: “Someone has to do the tough work, and the amazing team we have at Breitbart is stepping up in a fantastic way to fill the void left behind by the receding relevancy of waning established legacy operations. It’s an exciting time to be in journalism, and I’m not even 30 years old yet.” –Chris AriensFor the rest of the article, click here.Big Government, Big Journalism, Adweek, Matthew Boyle








During the event, Trump displayed a massive chart of the regulatory permitting process for a highway.Trump shows a list of government regulations, agencies, and permitting required to build a highway -> pic.twitter.com/j9IN6z6vr3— Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) April 4, 2017Trump previewed his plan to pass a trillion dollar infrastructure spending bill, but said he wanted companies taking the funding to start on their project within 90 days, or they wouldn’t get anything.He also committed to shortening the regulatory and permitting process from 10-20 years down to just a year.“We’re going to be able to get rid of 90%-95% of that and still have the same kind of protection,” he said, referring to environmental concerns.Trump admitted that the massive regulations favored bigger builders who could afford to get through the lengthy process, but said he wanted to open it up to others.“We’re going to cut a lot of red tape,” he promised.Several New York CEO’s at the event specifically urged Trump to spend more money on infrastructure in the region, citing the percentage of tax dollars sent to the Federal Government.“I love New York and in some ways, we’re all lucky that I’m from New York, because New York has unique problems,” Trump said. But he also singled out Los Angeles and Chicago as cities needing more investments.“I am watching over everybody,” he promised.Big Government, ceo town hall, Donald Trump, infrastructure plan








“Our mission statement directs the Department of Justice ‘to ensure public safety,’ ‘to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime’ and ‘to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans,’” the memo states. “We fully embrace and share these responsibilities with thousands of law enforcement agencies across the country that also seek to prevent crime and protect the public.”The memo states that the responsibility of upholding the rule of law “first and foremost” belongs to state, local, and tribal law enforcement. The memo states:The Deputy Attorney General and the Associate Attorney General are hereby directed to immediately review all department activities, including collaborative investigations and prosecutions, grant making, technical assistance and training, compliance reviews, existing or contemplated consent decrees, and task force participation in order to ensure that they fully and effectively promote the principles outlined above.The media, however, is characterizing the policies outlined in the memo as an “effort to cut back on federal oversight of local law enforcement,” and to end Obama’s efforts to “force local police to reform many policies, from the use of deadly force to how officers deal with minority communities,” USA Today reported on Monday.The USA Today report praises the accomplishments of the Obama DOJ, including an agreement with Ferguson, Mo. police after the 2014 death of an 18-year-old suspect and a similar agreement with Baltimore police after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray.All six police officers charged in Gray’s death while in police custody were vindicated in the case.“Under President Obama, the Justice Department opened investigations into more than two dozen police agencies and secured court-enforceable agreements in more than a dozen cases to force changes in local law enforcement policy,” USA Today reported.USA Today also reports on the results of a “scathing investigation” released in the waning days of the Obama administration in January into police conduct in Chicago that alleged “widespread racial bias, excessive use of force, poor training and feckless oversight of officers accused of misconduct.”“Sadly, our thorough investigation into the Chicago Police Department found that far too many residents of this proud city have not received that kind of policing,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in announcing the results of the investigation. “The resulting deficit in trust and accountability is not just bad for residents – it’s also bad for dedicated police officers trying to do their jobs safely and effectively.”In his memo, Sessions said: “The misdeeds of individual bad actors should not impugn or undermine the legitimate and honorable work that law enforcement officers and agencies perform in keeping American communities safe.”Critics of the memo, including the liberal group, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the memo “shocking” and cited the Lynch DOJ report on Baltimore police released in August.Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of LCCRUL said:In a 163 page report, the Justice Department laid out extensive evidence of unconstitutional policing practices including unlawful stops, searches, and arrests; racial disparities in the rates of stops, searches and arrests; and use of excessive force. The mayor, the community and the police department all support reform, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the obstacle standing in the way.National Public Radio reported on Tuesday that DOJ has asked a federal judge in Baltimore to delay a hearing this week on the Obama agreement with the police.NPR commentated in the news report that Sessions is “casting a cloud over a host of other federal consent decrees that target unconstitutional law enforcement practices.”Big Government, Law Enforcement, National Security, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, barack obama, DOJ, loretta lynch, memorandum, Police, state and local jurisdictions








Noting that the United States would not necessarily accept Assad running in a free and fair Syrian presidential election, she expressed faith that Assad would lose against a reasonable alternative candidate. “It’s that we don’t think the people want Assad anymore; we don’t think that he is going to be someone that the people want to have,” she said on Monday. Assad won re-election in 2014 with 88.7 percent of the vote, in an election then-Secretary of State John Kerry called a “sham.”Haley noted that the Trump administration had “no love for Assad” and accused him of violating international law. “We think that he has been a hindrance to peace for a long time. He’s a war criminal,” she said. “What he’s done to his people is nothing more than disgusting.”Last week, Haley told reporters that removing Assad from power was not “a priority” for the U.S. government, which led some in the media to question whether U.S. policy had shifted more in favor of Assad than in the past. “You pick and choose your battles,” Haley had said, “And when we’re looking at this, it’s about changing up priorities and our priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out.”Haley described discussions on whether the United States should actively remove Assad to be “been there, done that” failures.On Monday, Haley clarified that America does have a priority in Syria outside of removing Assad: defeating the Islamic State (ISIS). “Our goal is to do what we need to defeat ISIS. I don’t know that our goal is to talk to Assad in doing that,” Haley said. “Right now, Assad is not our number one person to talk to.”Following Haley’s statements last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to toe the same line during his visit to Turkey. “I think the … longer-term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people,” he told a reporter who asked him to comment on Haley’s remarks on Syria. The Turkish government has called for Assad’s ouster since shortly after the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly referring to Assad as a “terrorist.”Haley’s more recent condemnation of the Assad regime preceded by some hours a gruesome attack on a community in Idlib province, Syria, Tuesday morning, in which between 58 and more than one hundred people were killed. Casualty estimates from NGOs on the ground have varied significantly. The victims exhibited signs of being attacked with sarin gas, a chemical weapon banned by international laws of war. After the bombing of entire neighborhoods, allegedly with a chemical agent, aircraft flew over the hospitals and clinics treating the victims, conducting airstrikes on them.The Syrian government has not taken responsibility for the attack. The Syrian state news agency SANA instead published a denial of involvement from the Russian government, Assad’s closest international ally. “The Defense Minister has strongly dismissed another fake by Reuters Russian planes allegedly bombed Khan Shaikhoun, [Idlib]” the statement read. “Russian planes carried out no strikes in the area of Khan Shaikhoun.”The incident has triggered international condemnation, with some Western powers calling for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to address the incident. The White House issued a statement calling the bombings “heinous actions” and highlighting the inaction by the Obama administration in light of previous human rights violations by the Assad regime.Assad reportedly still possesses chemical weapons despite the Obama administration’s calling the use of such weapons a “red line” in 2012. Assad has since been accused of using the weapons on multiple occasions, and his officials have mocked the statement, with little response from the White House. Before leaving office, President Barack Obama said he did not “regret at all” calling the use of chemical weapons a “red line” and not acting on that statement.Breitbart Jerusalem, Middle East, National Security, Bashar al-Assad, Nikki Haley, Rex Tillerson, Russia, Syria








ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) — Investigators searched for possible accomplices of a 22-year-old native of the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan identified as the suicide bomber in the St. Petersburg subway, as residents came to grips Tuesday with the first major terrorist attack in Russia’s second-largest city since the Soviet collapse.The bomber, Akbarzhon Dzhalilov, had lived in St. Petersburg for several years, working as a car repairman and later at a sushi bar. Pages on his social media networks reflected his interest in radical Islam and boxing, but those who met Dzhalilov described him as a calm and friendly man.Russia’s health minister raised the death toll to 14, including the bomber. About 50 others remained hospitalized, some in grave condition. Many were students heading home Monday after classes on one of the city’s busy north-south lines.No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, which came as President Vladimir Putin was visiting his hometown, raising speculation it could have been timed for his trip. The attack follows a long string of bombings of Russian planes, trains and transportation facilities. Many of the attacks were linked to radical Islamists.Before Dzhalilov traveled to St. Petersburg where he eventually got Russian citizenship, his ethnic Uzbek family lived in Osh, the city in southern Kyrgyzstan that saw more than 400 people killed and thousands injured in clashes between ethnic Kyrgyz and minority Uzbeks in 2010.St. Petersburg has a large diaspora of people from Kyrgyzstan and other mostly Muslim former Soviet republics in Central Asia. They have fled ethnic tension, poverty and unemployment for jobs in Russia. While most Central Asian migrants hold temporary work permits or work illegally, thousands have received Russian citizenship in recent decades.Russian media said Dzhalilov worked with his father in a car repair shop and then became a cook at one of the city’s many sushi bars. He stayed in St. Petersburg when his parents moved back to Kyrgyzstan.One former colleague at the sushi chain described Dzhalilov, who turned 22 on Saturday, as “a very kind person.”“He was a non-conflict person. We didn’t expect to hear such news today,” said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared for her personal safety.Neighbors in Osh also described him as a nice and friendly man.Dzhalilov visited his home country about a month ago, and unlike past trips when he traveled directly back to St. Petersburg, he returned via Moscow. Investigators are looking into whether he met possible accomplices in Moscow, according to Russian media reports.Security cameras caught the bespectacled Dzhalilov as he entered the subway, appearing calm and clad in a red parka with a fur collar and blue wool hat. He wore a backpack believed to hold the bomb that was loaded with metal balls and screws for maximum damage.The Investigative Committee, Russia’s top investigative agency, said it also found Dzhalilov’s DNA on a bag with a similar bomb that was found and deactivated at another subway station shortly after the blast.Security experts have described people from Central Asia as fertile recruits for radical Islamist preachers, who have become increasingly active on social networks. Dzhalilov followed some radical Islamist pages on Russian social network, and media reports quoted investigators alleging he was linked to the Islamic State group.Putin has said that between 5,000 and 7,000 people from Russia and other former Soviet republics were fighting alongside the Islamic State group and other militants in Syria. He has named the IS threat as one of the reasons behind Russia’s military campaign in Syria.Chinara Esengul, an expert on radical Islam based in Kyrgyzstan, said on Dozhd TV that about 850 people from Kyrgyzstan have joined the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, according to official figures.Russian security agencies have been checking Dzhalilov’s contacts in St. Petersburg, while Kyrgyz law enforcement agencies have been talking to his parents in the impoverished nation.The Russian business daily Kommersant said that security agencies had learned of a terror plot in St. Petersburg from a Russian man affiliated with IS who had come from Syria. However, the man knew little and they tried to learn more by tapping phones of his contacts, the newspaper said.When Dzhalilov blew himself up, 10 other passengers were killed instantly. Three others died shortly after.Train driver Alexander Kaverin continued to the next station after hearing the blast, a decision that aided evacuation efforts and helped save many lives. “I had no time to think about fear at that moment,” he said.Viktor Khasiyev said he got a call from his father who was in the car hit by the explosion: “I heard screams, and then he said: ‘Son, we got blown up. Please come.'”Khasiyev rushed across St. Petersburg to find his father covered in blood and soot. “When he saw me, he cried,” the son recalled, adding that his father is being treated for a concussion and burns, but that his life isn’t in danger.“I still can’t believe that it happened in our city,” the younger Khasiyev said.While Moscow and many other Russian cities have seen numerous attacks linked to Islamic militants, the city of imperial palaces and world-famous art museums largely had escaped such violence until Monday.The entire subway was shut down and evacuated, paralyzing traffic in the city of 5 million before partial service resumed six hours later. Typically crowded during rush hour, the subway on Tuesday morning looked almost deserted as many residents opted for buses.“First, I was really scared,” said Viktoria Prishchepova, who did ride the subway. “I didn’t want to go anywhere on the Metro because I was nervous. Everyone was calling their loved ones yesterday, checking if they were OK and how everyone was going to get home.”On Tuesday morning, 53-year-old Oleg Alexeyev, who trains bomb-detecting police dogs, went to the station where the stricken train pulled in and victims were taken off. He laid flowers there in memory of those who died.“I traveled on the same route this morning just to see how it felt and think about life. You begin to feel the thin line about life and death,” he said.___Isachenkov reported from Moscow.

The gun battles took place on Sunday in the border city of Miguel Aleman, immediately south of Roma, Texas. The area is known as a busy drug smuggling corridor used by the Gulf Cartel since the region lacks any physical barriers–making the shallow waters of the Rio Grande the only obstacle to getting large marijuana loads into Texas.  According to information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Tamaulipas government, the first battle took place shortly after 1 p.m. when a convoy of Tamaulipas police officers were attacked by shooters in a white SUV. The police officers fought off the attack and chased the gunmen. During the chase, a police truck rolled over. Eventually, authorities were able to stop the white SUV and mortally wounded the gunman. A leaked video apparently filmed by one of the cops shows the moment when a cartel gunman with multiple gunshots to his torso and legs begins to cry. The police officers can be heard mocking him and using various expletives to tell him that he wanted to be a mobster and those were the consequences. The video also revealed that the SUV from the chase was carrying an arsenal inside. The graphic video may be viewed, here. 
Breitbart Texas was able to learn that the gunman eventually died from the multiple gunshot injuries he sustained. A second gun battle took place shortly after where authorities killed three others and seized 137 marijuana bundles. The drugs have an approximate weight of more than one ton.Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish.

Caitlyn Taylor of Louisville, 17, was swimming in an area behind a condominium in Destin, Florida, when a shark bit her leg, the Courier-Journal reported.As the shark bit her, the quick-thinking teen punched the five-foot shark.The Atherton High School student was in Destin with her school’s softball team for a tournament when the incident occurred.The shark bit her while she was in waist-deep water at around 3:39 p.m., according to the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.Michele Nicholson, an Okaloosa County Sheriff spokesperson, said the shark tugged on her legs before turning her loose.“She was hitting it with her hand and then it released” its bite, Nicholson said.Taylor suffered six puncture wounds from the shark bite and cuts on her hand and both legs, ABC News reported.Her mother Tracey, told ABC News affiliate KBMT that her daughter had to get “120 to 140 stitches.”Taylor posted an update on Twitter Sunday evening after the attack, along with a picture of the wounds.“Beyond lucky to be alive and well and thank you to everyone for the support and wishes and I’m going to be okay, love you guys,” she wrote on Twitter.The attack was “only the fourth documented attack off Okaloosa County beaches since 1882,” the Northwest Florida Daily News reported, and the sheriff’s department said authorities are not sure what type of shark attacked Taylor.Big Government, Pre-Viral, Weird News, Caitlyn Taylor, Destin, Florida, shark, Shark Attack, swimming








Each year, the National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE) promotes “Equal Pay Day,” a day of activism designed to bring attention to the curious claim that American women receive 20 percent lower compensation on average than men for the same work.Because feminists activists cite the wage gap as a justification of their claim that America is an oppressive patriarchal society dominated by men who actively participate in holding down women, it’s important that we seek widespread understanding that this claim is dishonest and untrue.Fortunately, there is a major problem with the studies that support the wage gap claim – they control for none of the relevant factors that explain it is not America’s oppressive and discriminatory patriarchal society that is to blame for such raw wage differences, but rather the different choices that men and women make with regards to their labor such as desired fields of work, and total amount of hours worked.Accounting for these relevant factors, such as hours worked, marital status, number of children, education, occupation, number of years of continuous uninterrupted job experience, is crucial to understanding the differences that arise in salary. Controlling for just the total hours worked lessens the gap to 10.7 percent. In fact, when all of these factors are controlled for, the wage gap almost disappears entirely.Even The Atlantic has called the gender wage gap, “famously false,” after they cited a PayScale study that revealed that “that the wage gap nearly evaporates when you control for occupation and experience among the most common jobs, especially among less experienced workers.”Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, points out that the loudest advocates for the gender pay gap fail to cite examples of specific firms paying women 20 percent less than men for doing the same job.Despite the widespread acceptance of the frequent “66/77/80 cents on the dollar for the same job” claims documented above, there is rarely ever any specific evidence presented showing that specific organizations are in violation of federal law by paying women 20% or more less than men for doing the same job.What politicians like Obama, Clinton, and Edwards, and gender activist organizations like the NCPE and AAUW are really implying is that firms and organizations across the country are rampantly and illegally violating the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by paying women 66/77/80 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men, and those deliberate, flagrant and ongoing violations are somehow going undetected.Writing in The Observer, columnist Ashe Schow highlighted that men tend to enter higher-paying fields and women tend to enter lower-paying fields.Nine of the top 10 highest-earning majors were dominated by men (the second highest-earning, pharmaceutical sciences and administration, were slightly dominated by women, at 52 percent). Nine of the top 10 lowest-earning majors were dominated by women (women made up just 34 percent of theology and religious vocation majors and 55 percent of health and medical preparatory programs).New research from the National Committee on Pay Equity for Equal Pay Day 2017 suggests that the wage gap is slowly closing, but the study cited fails to control for these relevant factors that would reveal that the source of the gap is not gender discrimination in hiring, but rather the different career paths and labor habits that men and women exhibit in contemporary American society.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

“I don’t use the term resistance … That was a term I associate with the French underground and people who risked their lives. So I don’t know that that’s a fair, apt metaphor for the latest contretemps over policy,” Brown told Nagourney.Nagourney’s article explores the efforts of Democratic politicians in California — who dominate the state’s politics — to lead the nationwide opposition to the Trump administration. The question of how, exactly, to conduct that opposition is one that divides the state party, and which is already playing into the election to succeed Brown as governor in 2018.While some candidates, and the state legislature, are pushing for more aggressive confrontations, Nagourney notes, “a more pragmatic dynamic is emerging for Democrats who are more settled in office” and need Trump’s “cooperation.” He mentions lobbying by state and local officials for a share of Trump’s proposed spending on infrastructure projects.An important example that escaped Nagourney’s attention is California’s reliance on the Trump administration to provide emergency relief. Already, the state has requested aid from the federal government four times since Trump took office, as it wrestles with the damage of heavy winter rains, snow and flooding. Each time, Trump has granted the aid.Democrats — not just in California — have embraced the term “resistance.” Left-wing Jewish groups are even calling themselves the “Jewish resistance,” even though the original Jewish Resistance Movement was a right-wing militia.Joel B.

As Twitter continues its desperate efforts to render its platform wholly antiseptic — even going so far as to employ a powerful AI moderator — another member of its leadership has made for the proverbial lifeboats.Twitter Head of Asia Pacific Aliza Knox is the latest in a line of Asia-based executives to flee the company. She was preceded by China Head Kathy Chen, India and Southeast Asia Head Parminder Singh, and the India-specific Rishi Jaitly, as well as Australia’s Karen Stocks. For anyone keeping track, that makes it a whopping 60% of executives gone in 2016 alone — even if you exclude VPs and above.Knox worked almost five years for Twitter after her time at Google, expanding Twitter’s presence to nine offices and more than 100 employees in their Asia Pacific unit. She ended her time with a fond farewell from her coworkers and employees and finished by passing the torch to her replacement, Maya Hari.#Amazing 4.5 years at @Twitter! Proud to have built a great APAC team to hand over to @Maya_Hari. Thanks for the farewell! #LoveWhereIWorked pic.twitter.com/GaMrBABvbR— alizaknox (@alizaknox) March 31, 2017In a statement released to TechCrunch, Twitter said:We thank Aliza for her contributions and leadership over the past four years and a half years.

Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León’s sanctuary bill passed on a straight party-line vote, 27-12, according to the Sacramento Bee. Strong pushback from law enforcement led to several amendments before the bill passed.The bill was first introduced as an “urgency” measure, as De León argued the Trump administration presented a threat to those in the country illegally. The Senate President later pulled the “urgency” status to lower the standard for passage, but at the cost of delaying the bill’s implementation to January 1, 2018.President Donald Trump has put sanctuary cities on notice that they could lose federal funding if they chose to continue to defy federal immigration authorities. In February the President called California a sanctuary state that is “out of control.”De León declared that “half” of his family were in the United States illegally, and lashed back at Trump during an interview on KPCC 89.3. In the interview he admitted “the vast majority of immigrants” have used fraudulent Social Security numbers.“SB 54 shields child abusers, human traffickers, and elder abusers from deportation and guarantees their return to our communities, and that’s why our fight must continue,” said State Senator Joel Anderson (R-Alpine) in an email to supporters after voting against the bill. “Over 31,000 Californians signed our petition and helped force the author to amend SB 54 so that murderers, rapists and child molesters would not be shielded from federal immigration authorities, but as long as felons are protected, we cannot stop fighting.”Anderson called the bill “the greatest threat to dreamers,” according to the Bee.Maryland has also been working on passing a sanctuary state law. The made national headlines in recent days on allegations that two illegal alien students had raped a young teenage girl in a school bathroom.Last week, Attorney General. Jeff Sessions warned that sanctuary jurisdictions could lose their portion of $4.1 billion in grants from the Department of Justice if they fail to comply with federal immigration law. He said that more than 200 jurisdictions had refused to honor ICE detainer requests in just one week. “The charges and convictions against these aliens include: drug trafficking, hit and run, rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder,” said Sessions.SB 54 now moves on to the State Assembly, where it is expected to pass and be signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana Big Government, Breitbart California, Immigration, California, Donald Trump, illegal alien, Jeff Sessions, kevin de leon, Sanctuary State








Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” President Barack Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice addressed reports she was responsible for the unmasking of names of Trump associates after the election during the transition period.Rice said unmaking names in intelligence reports she received is standard procedure insisting, “I leaked nothing to nobody,” adding there is “no equivalence” between unmasking and leaking.Rice said, “The allegation is that somehow Obama Administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes. That is absolutely false. I was the national security advisor. My job is to protect the American people and the security of our country. That’s the same as the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the CIA director, and every morning to enable us to do that, we receive, from the intelligence community, a compilation of intelligence reports that the intelligence community selected for us on a daily basis to give us the best information as to what is going on around the world. I received those reports as did each of the other officials, and there were occasions when I would receive a report in which a U.S. person was referred to. Name not provided, just U.S. person. And sometimes in that context, in order to understand the importance of the report, and assess it’s significance, it was necessary to find out, or request the information as to who the U.S. official was.”She continued, “I leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would. Let me explain this. First, to talk about the contents of a classified report — to talk about the individuals on the foreign side, who were the targets of the report itself, or any Americans that may have collected upon incidentally is to disclose classified information I’m not going to do that. Those people putting these stories out are doing just that. I can’t describe any particular report, and I have no idea what re reports — I don’t know the time frame, the subject matter, and I don’t know who they think was collected upon.”She added, “When the intelligence community would respond to a request to identify an American, that would come back only to the person requested it, brought back to them directly. To me, or to whoever might have requested it, on occasion, and this is important. It was not then typically broadly disseminated throughout the nation security community or the government. So the notion that some people are trying to suggest that by asking for the identity of an American person, that is the same as leaking it is completely false. There is no equivalence between so-called unmasking and leaking.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNENBreitbart TV, Andrea Mitchell, Andrea Mitchell Reports, MSNBC, Susan Rice








CNN’s Chris Cuomo cautioned “New Day” viewers Tuesday to beware what he called the “fake scandal being peddled by right-wing media” that is the report that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice was behind the unmasking of identities of members of the Trump transition team.According to Cuomo, there is “no evidence of any wrongdoing.”“So President Trump wants you to believe that he is the victim of a ‘crooked scheme.’ Those are his words. And here are our words: There is no evidence of any wrongdoing,” Cuomo said.He continued, “And, in fact, if anything the [national security adviser] asking for identities was a reflection of exactly how much traffic there was involving Trump people and foreign players.

Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough posed the question that if the allegation had been a Republican administration snooping on an incoming Democratic administration, specifically if it had been then-Vice President Dick Cheney asking for an unmasking of names of an Obama administration, what might the media reception to these reports be?“This Bloomberg report says that one official familiar with reports say they contained valuable political information, not intel, but valuable political information on what the Trump transition team was doing, including who Trump was meeting, who the Trump team was meeting, what the views were of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration,” he said.“What if Dick Cheney had asked for the unmasking of names for Barack Obama’s incoming administration?” Scarborough added. “It’s a very simple question to ask the next time anybody says this is much ado about nothing.”(h/t The Hill)Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBreitbart TV, Dick Cheney, Joe Scarborough, Morning Joe, MSNBC, Susan Rice








“I’m somewhat surprised in terms of the level of interest that I’ve seen from the press corps, one set of developments versus another set of developments,” Spicer said during the White House press briefing on Monday.Since President Donald Trump accused former President Obama’s administration of spying on his campaign staff, journalists have demanded evidence to back up his claims. Spicer suggested that the media was approaching the issue with a double standard after Rice’s activity was exposed.“I’m somewhat more from a media standpoint somewhat intrigued by the lack of interest that we’ve seen in some of these public revelations and reporting that has gone in that direction that we’ve seen in some of the other directions that we’ve seen,” he said.Spicer declined to comment about the new revelations, citing the ongoing investigation.“There’s a troubling direction that some of this is going in, but we’re going to let this review go on before we jump to it,” he said.In the aftermath of the news, some reporters suggested that Rice was merely doing her job by unmasking Trump’s National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.“If victim Flynn hadn’t been ‘unmasked’ — would Trump had fired him? Would it be better to have ‘masked’ man Flynn running NSC?” New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush asked on Twitter. “’Unmasking’ sounds better than ‘we picked a national security adviser who was on the payroll of 2 other countries.’”Trump has not reacted to questions about the revelations in the press and has not shared his opinion about the news on Twitter.Spicer said that the administration would not try to assign a motive to Rice’s reported behavior, but wait to see the results of the investigation.“We’re not going to start going down guessing the motives of something that is not assumed in fact yet,” he said.Big Government, Big Journalism, barack obama, Donald Trump, Glenn Thrush, Sean Spicer, Susan Rice, Trump campaign aides, white house press corps








The alleged spreadsheets add a new dimension to reports on Sunday and Monday by blogger Mike Cernovich and Eli Lake of Bloomberg News that Rice had asked for Trump aides’ names to be “unmasked” in intelligence reports. The alleged “unmasking” may have been legal, but may also have been part of an alleged political intelligence operation to disseminate reports on the Trump campaign widely throughout government with the aim of leaking them to the press.At the time that radio host Mark Levin and Breitbart News compiled the evidence of surveillance, dissemination, and leaking — all based on mainstream media reports — the mainstream media dismissed the story as a “conspiracy theory.”Now, however, Democrats are backing away from that allegation, and from broader allegations of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, as additional details of the Obama administration’s alleged surveillance continue to emerge.The Daily Caller reports:“What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday.“The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls.”The surveillance and spreadsheet operation were allegedly “ordered one year before the 2016 presidential election.” According to a Fox News report on Monday, former White House aide Ben Rhodes was also involved.Rhodes and Rice were both implicated in a disinformation campaign to describe the Benghazi terror attack in Sep. 2012 as a protest against a YouTube video. Rhodes also boasted of creating an “echo chamber” in the media to promote the Iran deal, feeding stories to contrived networks of “experts” who offered the public a steady stream of pro-agreement propaganda.On Monday, Rhodes retweeted a CNN story quoting Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) claiming that the alleged unmasking was “nothing unusual.”To the extent they have reported the surveillance story at all, CNN and other news outlets have focused on Trump’s tweets last month that alleged President Obama had “wiretapped” Trump Tower, describing the claims as unfounded.CNN continued treating story dismissively on Monday, with The Lead host Jake Tapper insisting allegations of Russian interference in the election were more important than what he referred to as the president’s effort to distract from them.Later in the day, host Don Lemon declared he would ignore the surveillance story and urged viewers to do likewise.The potential abuse of surveillance powers for political purposes has long troubled civil libertarians, and could affect the re-authorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act later this year.Joel B.

Farkas served as deputy assistant secretary of defense under the Obama administration. She has been in the spotlight since the news media last week highlighted comments she made on television that seemed to acknowledge efforts by members of the Obama administration to collect intelligence on Trump and members of his campaign.Now it has emerged that at on October 26, 2016, Farkas made remarks as a panelist at the annual Warsaw Security Forum predicting Trump’s removal from office “pretty quickly.”Asked at the event to address the priorities of a future Hillary Clinton administration, Farkas stated:It’s not a done deal, as you said. And so, to the Americans in the audience please vote. And not only vote but get everybody to vote. Because I really believe we need a landslide. We need an absolute repudiation of everything. All of the policies that Donald Trump has put out there. I am not afraid to be political. I am not hiding who I am rooting for. And I think it’s very important that we continue to press forward until election day and through election day to make sure that we have the right results.I do agree however with General Breedlove that even if we have the wrong results from my perspective America is resilient. We have a lot of presidential historians who have put forward very coherent the argument – they have given us examples of all of our horrible presidents in the past and the fact that we have endured. And we do have a strong system of checks and balances. And actually, if Donald Trump were elected I believe he would be impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government. And I am not even joking.Farkas was referring to General Philip Mark Breedlove, another panelist at the conference who served as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) of NATO Allied Command Operations.  The panel discussion was about what to expect following the Nov. 8 presidential election.Farkas has also been in the news after remarks she made as a contributor on MSNBC on March 2 resurfaced last week.  In the comments, she said that she told former Obama administration colleagues to collect intelligence on Trump and campaign officials.“I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,” stated Farkas.She continued:Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy … that the Trump folks – if they found out how we knew what we knew about their … the Trump staff dealing with Russians – that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence.The White House has utilized Farkas’s statements to bolster the charge that Trump was being illicitly surveilled during the campaign.White House Spokesman Sean Spicer last week stated:[I]f you look at Obama’s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense that is out there, Evelyn Farkas, she made it clear that it was their goal to spread this information around, that they went around and did this. …They have admitted on the record that this was their goal — to leak stuff. And they literally — she said on the record “Trump’s team.” There are serious questions out there about what happened and why and who did it. And I think that’s really where our focus is in making sure that that information gets out.Farkas, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia until she resigned in 2015.She told the Daily Caller last week that she had no access to any intelligence. “I had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn’t in government anymore and didn’t have access to any,” she said.Speaking to the Washington Post, Farkas denied being a source of any leaks.The Post reported:Farkas, in an interview with The Post, said she “didn’t give anybody anything except advice,” was not a source for any stories and had nothing to leak. Noting that she left government in October 2015, she said, “I was just watching like anybody else, like a regular spectator” as initial reports of Russia contacts began to surface after the election.Farkas currently serves as a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression.The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc., the U.S. State Department, and NATO ACT. Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations.Farkas serves on the Atlantic Council alongside Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of CrowdStrike, the third-party company utilized by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council.Last month, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency never had direct access to the DNC’s servers to confirm the hacking. “Well, we never got direct access to the machines themselves,” he stated. “The DNC in the spring of 2016 hired a firm that ultimately shared with us their forensics from their review of the system.”National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers also stated the NSA never asked for access to the DNC hardware: “The NSA didn’t ask for access. That’s not in our job.”Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) commented on a report that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice for President Barack Obama was behind the unmasking of the identities of members of Donald Trump’s transition team.Cotton noted Rice’s involvement in this story and her involvement in what he suggested were other Obama administration foreign policy missteps and likened her to “Typhoid Mary.”“Susan Rice is the Typhoid Mary of the Obama administration foreign policy,” Cotton said. “Every time something went wrong, she seemed to turn up in the middle of it, whether it was these allegations of improper unmasking, intentional or improper surveillance, whether it’s Benghazi or the other fiascos over the eight years of the Obama administration.”“If Eli Lake’s reporting is correct, it is hard to square what Susan Rice said in that PBS interview,” he added.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBreitbart TV, Hugh Hewitt, Obama, Susan Rice, Tom Cotton, wiretapping








The halt to the funding of the United Nations Population Fund – known as UNFPA – comes as Trump is scheduled this week to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.In January, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the “Mexico City Policy,” which concerns U.S. aid for abortions overseas. The president updated the policy by directing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to implement a plan that expands the policy across all global health assistance funding.The directive means that U.S. taxpayer dollars will no longer be supporting organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program, such as that espoused by China.A report by the Associated Press states that as a result of the end of U.S. funding of UNFPA, $32.5 million will shift to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has the goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices such as genital mutilation.As Breitbart News reported in December 2015, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), co-chair of the Congressional Executive Committee on China, observed during a hearing, “The Chinese government is not the only one culpable in these heinous crimes against women and children. The UN Population Fund helped fund birth restrictions, fund forced abortions, and a massive and coercive family planning bureaucracy.”“The UNFPA whitewashed China’s crimes for decades and continues to do so today,” the congressman continued, adding that on its website UNFPA “justifies its history in China, saying it was ‘tasked by the Executive Committee’ to help China and had to ‘engage with China as a sovereign nation.’”More than a year ago, China announced that it had switched to a “two-child policy,” one that Smith said only continues the country’s longstanding attempts to control family life:The “one-child policy” may possibly become a “two-child policy” but China’s police state population control policies will not end anytime soon. The Chinese government retains the power to tell couples what their families must look like and the power to punish those who disobey birth quotas. For the past 35 years the Chinese government has wasted precious human potential and sanctioned state-sponsored violence against women and children–enabled by pro-abortion groups globally and the United Nations Population Fund. No one should applaud China’s announced “two-child” policy; instead we should be insisting they abolish intrusive and abusive birth restrictions forever.Trump’s reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy was criticized in February by Bill and Melinda Gates, whose foundation has as its focus the support of family planning across the globe.  The Gates Foundation is also criticizing Trump’s foreign aid cuts:Foreign aid and access to contraceptives can be smart investments in a more stable and prosperous future. https://t.co/vP4DQo9BE0— Gates Foundation (@gatesfoundation) April 3, 2017“We’re concerned that this shift could impact millions of women and girls around the world,” Melinda Gates told the Guardian. “It’s likely to have a negative effect on a broad range of health programs that provide lifesaving treatment and prevention options to those most in need”:In Indonesia, I saw more proof that when we invest in contraceptives, we invest in a more stable & prosperous future https://t.co/YKPQEAdwE6— Melinda Gates (@melindagates) April 2, 2017Abortion, Big Government, National Security, China, forced abortion, Mexico City Policy, One Child Policy, President Donald Trump, UN Population Fund








Meadows established that the White House had not offered legislative text for a deal, but expects text within 24 hours. CNN reported that Meadows told reporters the provisions involved were the “essential health benefits” mandate, which dictates what insurers must cover, and a community health ratings requirement on insurers which prohibits charging higher premiums based on health status.Conservatives have lobbied to have the two Obamacare provisions strike from the House Leadership’s Obamacare replacement plan, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). The potential new deal appears to be an alternative option that would allow states to opt out.There is no final deal and no Freedom Caucus members have changed their positions on AHCA, was the message from Meadows. “There is no deal in principle; there is a solid idea that was offered,” he said according to the Hill. Lawmakers indicated the White House may be looking for a vote later this week, but Meadows warned of voting too soon and without time to allow the Congressional Budget Office to offer post-amendment analysis. He did offer that they are encouraged by the progress that appears to be happening.Some members of the moderate Tuesday Group, which could also stall passage of the AHCA, met with Pence earlier in the day at the White House according to the report.Over the weekend Sen. Rand Paul, who has opposed the AHCA, met and golfed with the President in Virginia. Paul took a brief moment to tell reporters that he was “very optimistic” about progress on repealing Obamacare.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana Big Government, Obamacare, AHCA, American Health Care Act, Donald Trump, freedom caucus, Mark Meadows, Mike Pence, obamacare, repeal and replace, Tuesday Group








Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day” that it is a “dark day in this history of the United States’ Senate” that Senate Republicans will likely have to invoke the nuclear option to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch as Supreme Court justice.“I think it’s a dark day in the history of the United States’ Senate,” McCain stated. “It’s going to happen, and it’s interesting that Republicans were dead seat against it when my former colleague Harry Reid invoked it with the judges, but now it seems to be okay.”McCain then explained how Republicans invoking the nuclear option now will only come back to haunt them when Democrats hold the Senate majority.“If you can do this with 51 votes, what do you think the next nominee is going to be like?” McCain asked. “And then what do you think is going to happen when the Democrats are in the majority in the Senate?”Follow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideoBreitbart TV, CNN, John McCain, New Day








The Protecting Sensitive Locations Act by Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR), Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Rep. José Serrano (D-NY), and Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) would essentially make it impossible for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to arrest illegal immigrants at courthouses, as well as medical, educational, and religious facilities.The legislation goes into a vague explanation of general areas where ICE agents would be banned, citing “other public spaces where the threat of immigration enforcement may deter individuals from seeking services or participating in their community.”Exemptions are included in the legislation, allowing for ICE to ignore the proposed law if the illegal immigrant is an “imminent risk of death, violence or physical harm to any person” and if the individual is a felon or terror suspect. The exemption would also apply for illegal immigrants who are suspected of trying to destroy evidence in a criminal investigation.Bonamici derided current immigration law enforcement procedures in an interview with the Washington Post, claiming recent deportations of criminal illegal immigrants were “mean-spirited.”“Our communities are better and safer if all residents feel secure when accessing justice, seeking education and health care, or practicing their faith,” Bonamici said. “Recent ICE action targeting immigrants has been aggressive and mean-spirited, and it does not improve the safety of our communities.”Due to the hundreds of sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide, ICE has said that it has been forced to use courthouses as a target location.“In years past, most of these individuals would have been turned over to ICE by local authorities upon their release from jail based on ICE detainers,” Virginia Kice told the LA Times. “Now that many law enforcement agencies no longer honor ICE detainers, these individuals, who often have significant criminal histories, are released onto the street, presenting a potential public safety threat.”Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly have both adamantly defended ICE against the attacks, writing in a letter together last month that “The arrest of people in a public place based upon probable cause has long been held by the United States Supreme Court as constitutionally permissible.”John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ DOJ laid down a more aggressive tone on the issue of the H-1B visa’s long history of being used to outsource Americans’ jobs to cheaper, foreign workers that are brought to the U.S.“The Justice Department will not tolerate employers misusing the H-1B visa process to discriminate against U.S. workers,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Civil Rights Division said in the statement. “U.S. workers should not be placed in a disfavored status, and the department is wholeheartedly committed to investigating and vigorously prosecuting these claims.”While the Immigration and Nationality Act is meant to prohibit discrimination against American workers solely because of their citizenship, the H-1B foreign guest worker visa has defied those rules for decades.Under the H-1B visa, 85,000 new foreign workers are brought to the U.S. every year, often taking once high-paying jobs from Americans who are fired and forced to train their replacements.If the H-1B visa program had never been introduced and enacted, computer science job availability in the labor market would be up 11 percent and wages in the tech industry would have increased by five percent, Breitbart News reported.The H-1B visa remains incredibly unpopular with American voters. As Breitbart Texas reported, only 30 percent of Americans say companies bringing in foreign workers to fill jobs are necessary. Some 44 percent said those foreign workers take jobs away. The vast majority of Americans also said the number of H-1B visas allotted every year to companies should either be decreased or kept at the current levels.While President Donald Trump has signaled support for legislation that would raise the minimum salary for H-1B visa workers, the White House has not taken any steps thus far to reform the program, as Breitbart Texas reported.Trump’s nominee to lead the Labor Department, Alexander Acosta, curiously told Congress last month that it was “not the intent” of the visa to replace Americans with foreigners, as Breitbart Texas reported.

The agency is nonetheless a long way from filling what VA Secretary David Shulkin told lawmakers amounts to as many as 45,000 vacant positions, multiple media outlets are reporting.On March 13, Shulkin issued a memorandum adding 60 job titles to the list of vacant posts, including openings at Arlington Cemetery, in cybersecurity, law enforcement, and criminal investigations, Stars and Stripes reported.The memo also added more positions at the Veterans Crisis Line, a service that offers confidential support for veterans.In all, the memo increased freeze-exempt jobs to 156, but “it was unclear… how many more of the 45,000 vacancies could be filled based on Shulkin’s memo. However, depending on how many vacancies there are for each job title, there could be hundreds, possibly thousands, of additional positions exempt from the hiring freeze,” Stars and Stripes reported.In December, a Government Accountability Office report found that the agency has “systemic, long-standing human capital challenges,” and Congress has called on the VA to increase staff to serve veterans better.In February, the GAO said the VA would remain on its “high risk” list of areas of the federal government prone to waste and mismanagement and in need of more oversight.Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA), who sits on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, introduced legislation that would completely exempt the VA from the hiring freeze, but the legislation has yet to be taken up, according to Stars and Stripes.When asked by National Public Radio about filling such a vast amount of openings at the agency Shulkin said that negative publicity about the agency hampers hiring.“Well, we have about 360,000 employees in the VA health care system,” Shulkin told NPR’s Morning Edition. “It’s the largest health care system in the country, and we have many job openings.”Shulkin said;This is actually something you see across America, particularly in rural America, where there’s a shortage of health care professionals.We’re out actively trying to recruit many health care professionals… and the negative attention that’s been put on VA has hurt the morale of our work force.So what we’re trying to do is get people to understand that when they come to work at VA, this is really a terrific place to work. It’s filled with dedicated professionals, we’re doing great work every day, it’s a way to serve your country and we want people to come join us.According to the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, 453,000 veterans were unemployed in 2016. The unemployment rate in 2016 was 4.2 percent for male veterans and five percent for female veterans.“In 2016, 20.9 million men and women were veterans, accounting for about nine percent of the civilian noninstitutional population age 18 and over,” the BLS noted in its press release.According to BLS, “In 2016, the unemployment rate of veterans varied across the country, ranging from 1.8 percent in Indiana to 7.6 percent in the District of Columbia.”Big Government, National Security, department of veterans affairs, job openings, unemployment








April 4 (UPI) — The California Senate passed a bill barring local and state law enforcement from helping federal immigration enforcement.Approval of the bill is seen as defiance of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.Senate Bill 54, the “sanctuary state” bill, was passed by a 27-12 vote along party lines on Monday evening, with Democrats supporting the measure and Republicans s opposing it. The bill will go to the State Assembly, where Democrats hold a majority, and if approved, to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown.Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, who introduced the bill, called its passage a “rejection of President Trump’s false and cynical portrayal of undocumented residents as a lawless community.”The bill bars state and local law enforcement agencies from using their resources to help in federal immigration enforcement. Inquiring about immigration status, providing federal immigration authorities access to interview a person in custody or assisting in immigration enforcement would be prohibited under the bill.Exceptions are included in the bill; it allows local agencies to transfer individuals to federal immigration authorities if a judicial warrant is present, or if the person has been previously convicted of a violent felony. It also requires notification to federal authorities of releases of those convicted of violent felonies.“Our precious local law enforcement resources will be squandered if police are pulled from their duties to arrest otherwise law-abiding maids, busboys, laborers, mothers and fathers. Trust will be lost. Crimes will go unreported for fear of deportation.” de Leon said {link:in a statement.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A push to offer in-state college tuition rates to students whose parents brought them into the country illegally is picking up unlikely momentum from some Republicans in Tennessee, a deeply conservative state that voted overwhelmingly for President Donald Trump and his tough stance on immigration.If the lawmakers succeed, Tennessee would follow the lead of Washington, D.C., the only other local government to pass such an ordinance since Trump took office in January. Twenty other states already allow the in-state tuition.To sell the idea, the bill’s supporters have had to maneuver carefully, steering the debate away from illegal immigration policy whenever possible.Instead, they are promoting the measure as an economic driver and an educational opportunity for students who didn’t have a choice about crossing into the United States at a young age. They say the students are innocent victims of decades of political deadlock on immigration at the national level.“I’m all for building the wall and U.S. sovereignty, closing our borders,” said Rep. Mark White, a Memphis Republican and a bill sponsor. “But we didn’t, and now we’re damaging innocent people.”At the state Capitol, dozens of students whose parents crossed into the U.S. illegally and brought them along have gone lawmaker to lawmaker to share their personal stories. Republican Gov. Bill Haslam took time to meet and snap photos with them last month, and he has thrown his support behind the bill.A House and Senate panel each have passed the proposal so far, and another House committee was scheduled to vote on it Tuesday.Two years ago, when President Barack Obama was still in office, the proposal passed in the Senate and came one vote shy of passing in the House. The Senate may wait for the House to act first this year, Republican Speaker Randy McNally said.Trump has spoken of mass deportations and building a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Nonetheless, White is optimistic the Tennessee bill has a chance.“I’m just trying to protect Tennessee in the long run, because they’re here,” White said. “And if anybody thinks that we’re going to send children who grew up here back out of this country, they’re not living in the real world. We need to do what’s the next best thing, and that’s help them assimilate into our society.”According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, about 20 states offer in-state tuition to students who are either in the United States illegally or here under Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects them from deportation for two years and lets them work. A half-dozen or so of those states tilt Republican.The Tennessee legislation would apply to students who have attended a state high school or home school program for two years.Even if the bill passes, the students would not qualify for federal financial aid. Nor would they be eligible for state programs that offer students free tuition at community and technical colleges, said Ginger Hausser, director of external affairs for the Tennessee Board of Regents.Sen. Todd Gardenhire, a Chattanooga Republican and the bill’s sponsor in the Senate, notes that the state has already invested in the students by paying for their K-12 education, and that some have lived in Tennessee as long as their counterparts who are U.S. citizens. Yet they are required to pay three times what other in-state students pay to attend college, he said.The bill’s opponents are framing their arguments around illegal immigration. The same legislature continues to advance a bill that would cut funding to immigrant-protecting sanctuary cities.“I don’t think anybody in this room blames (the students),” Rep. Dawn White, a Republican from Murfreesboro, said in a committee meeting. “But, as a representative, I owe the state taxpayers the right to say, ‘Why are we subsidizing illegal students?'”Lisa Sherman-Nikolaus, Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition policy director, said she is optimistic about the bill’s chances amid support from the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce, the Tennessee Farm Bureau, the governor, and the state Board of Regents, which governs colleges, among others.“We think that this is a real opportunity to remind people, remind legislators, that even in such a divisive climate we can all come together and agree that educating Tennesseans is important,” Sherman-Nikolaus said.Elman Gonzales, a 19-year-old who graduated from Sevierville County High School, said he could go back to East Tennessee State University if the bill becomes law. He had to drop out because tuition was $12,000 a semester, temporarily sidelining his hopes of becoming a doctor.Gonzales, who was brought to Tennessee at 2 years old when his parents moved from Honduras, said he was “genuinely surprised” at the bill’s movement so far, “considering the political atmosphere.”Telling lawmakers their stories one-on-one has made a big difference, Gonzales said.“That to me is going to make the most difference because that shows them directly that these students are being affected by this, and how much their lives can change by voting yes on this bill,” Gonzales said.








The two nations have ignored Brussels’ insistence that they take migrants presently residing in great numbers in Italy and Greece. Public opinion in Hungary and Poland is also strongly against being forced to accept thousands of migrants from non-European cultures.Poland’s conservative Law and Justice Party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość – PiS) swept to victory in 2015, partly due to voter anger over the previous government agreeing to take migrants under the quota system.In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has been a vocal opponent of the scheme from its conception, asserting that forcing member countries to take a compulsory quota of migrants is unlawful and will “spread terrorism around Europe”.Later this year, the two countries will be given an ultimatum and have to decide whether they are willing to maintain an anti-mass migration stances if it puts their membership of the EU at threat, a senior diplomatic source from one of the bloc’s six founding member states told The Times.The source said: “They will have to make a choice: are they in the European system or not? You cannot blackmail the EU, unity has a price.”The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is expected to hold a hearing on the legality of migrant quotas in the coming weeks, with a judgement — widely expected to be in favour of the scheme — likely by the end of the year.“We are confident that the ECJ will confirm validation,” the source said. “Then they must abide by the decision. If they don’t then they will face consequences, both financial and political. No more opt-outs. There is no more ‘one foot in and one foot out’. We are going to be very tough on this.”Hungary challenged the court, insisting that it is culturally and constitutionally unreasonable to impose asylum seekers on unwilling member states.In December, referring to policies of importing large numbers of people from the third world, Orbán stated that Hungary and other countries in Central Europe “have had the opportunity to learn from Western Europe’s mistakes”.“Hungary is a stable island in the turbulent western world because the people were consulted on their opinions here, and we defended the country against illegal immigration.”In 2015, when European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans demanded Eastern and Central EU nations undergo similar demographic transitions as in Western Europe, Hungary was singled out for special mention.“Any society, anywhere in the world, will be diverse in the future — that’s the future of the world,” Timmermans said. “So [Central European countries] will have to get used to that. They need political leaders who have the courage to explain that to their population instead of playing into the fears as I’ve seen Mr Orbán doing in the last couple of months.”Breitbart London reported that the European Union is to open asylum processing centres in west Africa and countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean because the continent “needs six million migrants”, the European Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos said last month.Breitbart London, Immigration, EU migrant crisis, EU migrant quota, EU migrant redistribution policy, European Commission, European Union, hungary, Poland, Viktor Orbán








“Hungary is situated on Europe’s external border. So if Hungary’s external border is endangered, then Europe’s external border is endangered. Hungary is simultaneously protecting its own external borders and Europe’s external borders,” the Fidesz leader explained in an interview with Kossuth Rádió.“And if we weren’t protecting Europe’s external borders, the Austrians and the Germans would be in big trouble, [as] at that time Hungary was unable to protect Europe’s external borders and millions of migrants marched through Hungary towards Austria and Germany.”On 4 March, 2017, Breitbart London reported that immigration to Germany in the decade to 2015 was close to four million, surpassing even the Turkish “guest worker” surge of the 1980s. At least two million arrived in 2014-15 alone.The country’s free and easy attitude to mass migration came at a high price, being accompanied by high profile crime and terror events and costing taxpayers tens of billions of euros“We put an end to this, and everyone in Austria and Germany is happy about that – although political double-dealing doesn’t allow them to say so, or write about it,” Orbán said.“Let’s put it this way: in a number of countries in Europe there is a culture of hypocrisy; everyone knows that without the Hungarians they’d be in much bigger trouble than they are in now – indeed, they’d be in real trouble. Everyone knows this, and in the corridors and in meetings behind closed doors everyone thanks Hungary for its work.“But when it comes to public statements, everyone says – though not with the same intensity as earlier, because the situation was far worse two years ago – that things are not quite right.”European Union sources have threatened that Hungary and Poland may actually be expelled from the bloc for refusing to accept compulsory migrant quotas, a measure forced through despite opposition from Central European member-states.“If someone wants to live in Hungary, they must seek the permission of the Hungarian people,”  Orbán believes.“There can be no international principle, norm, court or organisation which says that it doesn’t matter what the Hungarian people think about their own country and about whom they want to live together with, and that someone else will decide for us. This is impossible.”Border, Breitbart London, Immigration, Brussels, EU, Europe, European Union, fidesz, Germany, hungary, Viktor Orbán








Relations between the region and the central government have seriously deteriorated in recent years because of Catalonia’s demand to hold an independence vote, contrary to Spain’s constitution.Catalonia says it will hold a binding referendum in September and included provisions for the ballot in its 2017 spending plans presented last month.A court statement Tuesday said the suspension would initially last five months while it studies the government challenge and makes a ruling.Polls show the 7.5 million Catalans are evenly divided on independence, but a majority supports a referendum.The region, whose capital is Barcelona, represents a fifth of Spain’s GDP.Breitbart London, Catalonian, Spain








Reaching out to what the Front National leader calls “forgotten France”, Le Pen spoke at a rally in an open-sided barn to nearly 1,000 people in the small Eure-et-Loir town, which has a population of just 1,200, on Monday.“The other candidates are only in big cities,” she said whilst taking selfies with the eager members of the crowd. “I have been meeting in small villages and meeting French people who have never seen a candidate come to see them. It is my place, I am here among the French people who I want to defend.”"Au nom de quoi nous n'aurions pas le droit de nous protéger face au dumping social et à la concurrence déloyale ?" #BazocheGouët pic.twitter.com/HWKIRSYkQV— Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) April 3, 2017Focusing on rural affairs in her address, Le Pen also drove home her national agenda of neutrality, secularism, and security.“On security, it will be zero tolerance,” she said. “I will never ask the French to get used to terrorism. I will  bring Islamist fundamentalism to its knees!”Promising to put ‘France First’, Le Pen affirmed: “With me at the head of the State, never will a stowaway be treated better than a Frenchman in his own country.”"Je ne peux plus supporter d'entendre #Macron insulter la France, dire qu'il veut vous "chasser", vous, patriotes de France !" #BazocheGouët pic.twitter.com/TpgWNtIzIk— Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) April 3, 2017Ms. Le Pen also criticised pro-mass migration En Marche candidate Macron, who during a speech in Marseilles Saturday attacked Ms. Le Pen, her party, and by inference, her supporters.During a rally in the crime-plagued Mediterranean port city, where 30 to 40 per cent of the population are Muslim, Macron declared: “Let us drive away from this campaign, far from the country, the party of hatred, that of contempt, of the withdrawal, and all of those who make us so ashamed.”Calling his words “contemptuous”, the Front National party leader said: “I can no longer bear to hear Mr. Macron say that you, you patriots, should be driven out of your own country.”“We do not insult the people like that, Mr. Macron,” said Ms. Le Pen, to which the audience applauded and chanted: “We are at home.”“How can Mr. Macron make such abject remarks towards the patriots and lovers of France that you are, that we are. He has insulted France by saying that she has committed a crime against humanity in Algeria.”Le Pen was referencing comments made by Macron in February when he implied a collective national guilt for stating that French colonisation of Algeria was a “crime against humanity” – a comment that cost him five voter intention points in the days that followed."Le patriotisme n'est pas une idée morte, c'est au contraire le creuset de notre avenir, de nos rêves !" #BazocheGouët pic.twitter.com/FBSvi2l4Ut— Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) April 3, 2017“Patriotism is not a dead idea,” she added, “On the contrary, it is the crucible of our future, of our dreams.”Current polling suggests likely voter intention puts Marcon just 0.5 per cent ahead of Le Pen (26 per cent/25.5 per cent) for first round voting. Le Pen, who addressed young voters in Bordeaux on Sunday, is polling equal with Macron at 24 per cent with 18-24-year-olds.The first round of the presidential election occurs on 23 April, with the run-off set to take place on 7 May.A supporter of candidate for the presidential election Marine Le Pen, wears a t-shirt with a portrait of U.S President Donald Trump during a meeting in La Bazoche Gouet, central France, Monday, April 3, 2017.Breitbart London, Emmanuel Macron, French Presidential Elections 2017, Front National, Marine Le Pen








According to Fox News and the Associated Press, Syrian medical relief organization UOSSM reported least 100 people were killed and 400 more injured. Some other estimates put the death toll as low as 57. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights added that at least 11 children were among the dead.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is reportedly investigating the incident.The UK Independent reports that an AFP journalist saw rubble crashing down on the medical staff treating patients at one hospital, while as-yet-unverified footage showed an explosion striking a hospital while a reporter was interviewing doctors on-camera.“The Syrian Civil Defence rescue group said two of its centres were targeted by air strikes – one in Khan Sheikhoun and one in nearby Habit. The group said none of its volunteers were injured but the damage put the facilities out of service,” the Independent writes. Khan Sheikhoun is about 30 miles south of the city of Idlib.The BBC interviewed a reporter and ambulance driver who observed people choking in the streets after the chemical weapon strikes. The relief service this ambulance driver works for published photographs depicting “what appeared to be at least seven dead children in the back of a pick-up truck,” with no sign of traumatic injuries on their bodies.One AFP journalist reported seeing “a young girl, a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital, all with foam still visible around their mouths.” The facility where this gruesome tableau was observed was subsequently hit by a rocket strike, burying doctors under rubble.A Syrian medical activist reported at least 18 “critical cases” of unconscious people bleeding from the nose and mouth to the Associated Press. Another eyewitness, a photographer for the Idlib Media Center, said he found “entire families inside their homes, lying on the floor, eyes wide open and unable to move.” He reported feeling a burning sensation after he touched their clothing.The BBC notes these symptoms are consistent with the use of sarin gas, which causes death by asphyxiation within a matter of minutes, and is very difficult to detect. The Syrian government has allegedly used sarin gas on previous occasions. The regime of dictator Bashar Assad denied using the gas and blamed rebel fighters for deploying it.CBS News reports the Syrian and Russian governments “flatly denied any responsibility” for the attack. The Russian defense Ministry denied conducting any airstrikes on the Khan Sheikhoun area, while Syrian officials “repeated blanket denials of ever having used chemical weapons,” and in fact denied targeting anyone except “terrorists” at all.CBS posted Tweets from a man identifying himself as a British-trained physician performing volunteer work in northern Syria, claiming he found evidence of a Sarin gas attack:Do u still doubt that #Sarin is being used on us? Non-reactive pinpoint pupils! We have samples. Will anyone care!? Who will stop it?#Syria pic.twitter.com/WmhDZgLVA6— Dr Shajul Islam (@DrShajulIslam) April 4, 2017Several British analysts and officials also told CBS they believed a nerve agent was deployed in the attack, while the British government formally stated that photos from Khan Sheikhoun “strongly suggest the use of chemical weapons.” One analyst said the symptoms resembled the notorious Ghouta attack of 2013 that crossed President Barack Obama’s rhetorical “red line” against WMD. The upshot of that epic Obama administration debacle was Syria supposedly destroying its chemical weapons stockpile under the watchful eye of Russia.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson declared himself “horrified” and said the attack “bears all the hallmarks” of the Syrian government. He stated the British government will “continue to lead international efforts to hold perpetrators to account.”Britain and France have called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the attack, and urged Russia and China not to block international action against the responsible parties.Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu quickly weighed in on the attack. He said the “shocking pictures” from Idlib should “shake every human being.”“Israel strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons in any situation, especially against innocent civilians. Israel calls on the international community to fulfill promises made in 2013, and to remove chemical weapons from Syria,” Netanyahu said.The Jerusalem Post quotes former Israeli military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin calling upon Israel to “establish a more active policy against the negative developments” and make Assad “pay for his war crimes.” He complained of the void in global authority left by Obama’s “red line” collapse, and said the void was filled by “Russia, the Islamic State, and Hezbollah.”“Today’s chemical attack in Syria against innocent people including women and children is reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration’s weakness and irresolution,” said White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday.“President Obama said in 2012 he would establish a red line against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable act,” Spicer continued.Breitbart Jerusalem, Middle East, National Security, barack obama, bashar assad, Benjamin Netanyahu, Boris Johnson, chemical weapons, Donald Trump, Idlib province, John McCain, Russia, Sarin gas, Syria, u.n. security council, United Nations, weapons of mass destruction








According to reports, the police arrived to arrest the individual after he’d attempted to set fire to migrant accommodation. The footage shows a young male asylum seeker in Fagersjö, south of Stockholm, walking up to a  car and proceeding to smash the windows of the vehicle.After walking away, he smashes the back window of another car, a white Volvo, parked nearby. Still carrying a large piece of metal, the asylum seeker approached a police car containing three female officers and attacked them.After attacking one of the officers with the piece of metal, the asylum seeker was quickly detained by another male asylum seeker who wrestles him to the ground and allowed the officers to attempt to place handcuffs on him. Despite three of the female officers trying to subdue the asylum seeker with pepper spray, they had difficulty getting him into their car.The asylum seeker was able to break free of all three female officers and proceeded to fight with them punching a blonde officer to the ground. After the altercation, the asylum seeker walked away as those filming, likely also asylum seekers, laughed at the Swedish police.According to Swedish website Friatider, the asylum seeker was apprehended after the video ends but not before attempting to set several fires in the asylum home. They say the video was shot two weeks ago on 20 March but not published until Sunday afternoon.Since the 1990s, the Swedish police have maintained a gender-equality policy and has invested time and money into recruiting more women into the service.Feminism is popular in Sweden but recent incidents have called into question the various political policies based on feminist ideology. Last year, one such policy caused chaos on the streets of Stockholm when the city decided to plough pedestrian areas rather than main roads because women are said to walk more to work than men.The heavily migrant-populated suburbs have also been a test for feminists in Sweden, some of whom are now moving away because Islamic fundamentalists do not tolerate their presence in the areas. Zeliha Dagli, a former Left Party politician, formerly lived in the no-go Stockholm suburb of Husby, but because of harassment and fear for her safety, she decided to move to the more liberal centre of the Swedish capital.“There were rumours that we wanted to take away women’s veils,” Dagli said. “They said that I should keep myself, and then I did not feel so safe anymore.” Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart.comBreitbart London, Immigration, asylum seekers, feminism, Sweden, Swedish police








Mrs. May criticised the National Trust, a major charity that preserves many of Britain’s historic sites, saying she did not know “what they are thinking”.The Trust holds an Easter egg hunt that sees thousands of children search for chocolate eggs at many of its properties each year. However, this year it has been rebranded to remove any reference to the Christian feast.Chocolate firm Cadbury, which sponsors the event, said they removed it to appeal to non-Christians. “We invite people from all faiths and none to enjoy our seasonal treats,” they said.However, speaking in the Saudi capital Riyadh, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “I’m not just a vicar’s daughter – I’m a member of the National Trust as well. I think the stance they’ve taken is absolutely ridiculous and I don’t know what they’re thinking about.“Easter’s very important. It’s important to me, it’s a very important festival for the Christian faith for millions across the world.“So I think what the National Trust is doing is frankly just ridiculous.”The Archbishop of York also hit out at Cadbury, accusing the company of “spitting on the grave” of its Quaker founder.“If people visited Birmingham today in the Cadbury World they will discover how [John] Cadbury’s Christian faith influenced his industrial output,” he said.“He built houses for all his workers, he built a church, he made provision for schools etc.  It is obvious that for him Jesus and justice were two sides of the one coin.“To drop Easter from Cadbury’s Easter Egg Hunt in my book is tantamount to spitting on the grave of Cadbury.”There are increasing instances of Christianity being airbrushed from British public life as ignorance of the country’s traditional faith grows.In 2014, Oxford City Council refused to give permission for a “Passion play” – a re-enactment of the trial and crucifixion of Christ – to take place in the city’s streets because an official thought the word “passion” meant it was a sex show.Oxford City Councillor Dick Wolff, who is also a United Reformed Church pastor, said: “Unfortunately, one of the city council’s licensing officers didn’t recognise that a Passion play on Good Friday was a religious event.”“I think he thought it was a sex show, so he said it may be committing an offence.”Breitbart London, Faith, Easter, Theresa May








The event, “Ayaan Hirsi Ali: Hero of Heresy”, was billed as an opportunity to “step inside the controversy” surrounding Islam and women’s place within the religion.While she refused to further elaborate on the reasons for the abrupt cancellation of a tour that was to take in Australian and New Zealand audiences, Ms. Hirsi Ali told the Seven Network in Australia she wishes to “defy” her opponents and “come and expose them for what they are.”“These are people who are far more interested in defending sharia Law, that’s Islamic law, and the doctrine of radical Islam, over human rights,” she said of her opponents, which included a group in the state of Victoria called Against Islamophobia who reportedly called venues at which she was booked to speak and threatened mass protests.The U.S.-based, Somali-born activist has long argued that too many Westerners, especially liberals, can’t bring themselves to offend Muslims and thus avoid making necessary criticisms of Islamic doctrine.She believes her trip to Australia was eventually made impossible because of a lack of support from those same liberals and cited a group of Australian Muslim women who accused her of being a “star” of Islamophobia and stirring hate mongering and bigotryJust 400 people signed an online petition against Ms. Hirsi Ali’s speaking tour but it was enough, when combined with threats of protest, to sway organisers against going ahead.“Against a backdrop of increasing global Islamophobia, Hirsi-Ali’s divisive rhetoric simply serves to increase hostility and hatred towards Muslims,” the petition, posted on Change.org, said.“Today you have this horrible alliance between the far left and the Islamists and they’re using the modern media tool to shut people like me out by smearing us,” Ms. Hirsi Ali told AAP in response to the petition’s wording, before denying she is a critic of all forms of immigration.“It’s the assumption that all immigrants are bad and all Muslims are bad, I don’t hold that view,” Ms. Hirsi Ali said. “But the burqa that covers the face, and that is really very much in your face, that kind of thing is just like the ISIS flag, it’s like wearing a very big swastika.”In a paper written for the Hoover Institute at Stanford University last month, Ms. Hirsi Ali argues the public needs to be better educated about the political ideology of Islamists and the ways they recruit and finance their operations so they can reach their ultimate goal of imposing sharia law. Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart London, National Security, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, free speech, human rights, Islamic doctrine, radical islam, Sharia Law








The Central Council of Jews in Germany are demanding answers from school administrators in Berlin regarding the case of a 14-year-old Jewish boy who was severely bullied by Muslim students. President of the council Josef Schuster said: “If the reports are correct, this is a shattering event.”He added the administration should assess what went wrong for the bullying to happen in the first place, Die Welt reports.The parents of the victim say the school’s headmaster did not react fast enough to stop the assaults which were perpetrated by Turkish and Arab students. The attacks occurred at the Friedenauer Gemeinschafts school where an estimated 75 per cent of the students speak German as a second language.The school has since posted an open letter on their website expressing “regret and horror” over the attack. They say it is the first time the school has had to deal with anti-Semitism and spoke of their commitment to anti-racism.School administrators added the school is looking to transfer the Muslim students involved to another school and claimed to have invited the grandparents of the victim, both Holocaust survivors, to talk to the bullies.Former president of the Jewish Council, Charlotte Knobloch, said the incident is not an isolated one. According to Knobloch, more and more students are marginalised and attacked “because they are Jews”.Aaron Eckstaedt, director of the Jewish Berlin Moses Mendelsson senior school, said he sees at least six to ten students per year who have transferred from other schools due to abuse from Muslim students.Anti-Semitism is on the rise in Germany, according to a report from the German Ministry of Justice who said last year that anti-Semitic incidents had gone up 300 per cent in 2015.One incident that was not labelled anti-Semitic was the firebombing of a synagogue by three Muslim men in 2014. According to a German court, the firebombing was a legitimate act of criticism against the government of Israel.Anti-Semitism in France has reached even higher proportions with Jews fleeing French suburbs following attacks and threats from Muslim residents. In 2015, thousands of French Jews left France entirely and moved to Israel because of harassment. Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart.comBreitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart London, Immigration, anti-semitic attacks, Germany, Germany Migrants, Islamic anti-semitism








The government will now know exactly who is attending services and with what regularity, as well as being able to monitor everything that is said from the pulpit.The Zhejiang government issued the order to install surveillance cameras in the churches in Wenzhou at the end of last year and began carrying out the edict in January. Although the communist government alleges that the video cameras are being installed for “anti-terrorism and security purposes,” in point of fact, China has not experienced any threat of terrorist activity from its Christian communities.According to the U.S.-based human rights group China Aid, churches were instructed to install cameras at gates, rostrums, offering boxes and other places. If the churches refuse to comply, government officials will forcibly set up the devices.“Government officials came to the churches and put up cameras by force. Some pastors and worshippers who didn’t agree to the move were dragged away,” one Christian from Wenzhou reported. “Some people needed to be treated in hospital after fighting the officials.”China Aid reported that in late March, “hundreds of police officers” converged on Changlin Church in Wenzhou to set up video monitoring equipment, and beat the Christians who tried to put up opposition. Officials also vandalized the church, demolishing its reception desk and other parts of the building, including the church’s gate.An official notice declaring that all churches would have to install the cameras was circulated among church members at the end of last year, according to reports.Wenzhou has the highest concentration of Christians on the mainland, with a Christian community numbering roughly one million people out of a total population of 8 million.Christians have protested the ruling, saying that it infringes their right to privacy as well as their freedom of worship.“I don’t support the government’s decision and I hope they will not put monitoring equipment inside our church,” one local churchgoer said. “We Christians do good deeds and we don’t do anything to endanger the public. I don’t understand why the government wants to monitor us,” he said.“The government’s pressure on us will not deter us from our beliefs and will not affect the ­proliferation of our religion,” he added. “The tougher the persecution, the more people will be encouraged to follow the religion.”Pastor Yan Xiaojie, a missionary in the city, said the new cameras reminded him of the “cross demolitions” which began in 2014. The new ruling comes just three years after the start of an intensive campaign to remove crosses from the roofs of houses of worship.The Zhejiang government announced that in installing the new cameras officials would take into account whether or not a given church had previously resisted cross demolitions and would send more agents to the site if it had.As part of its cross-removal campaign, government officials forcibly eliminated or destroyed more than 2,000 crosses from Christian churches in Wenzhou between 2014 and 2016.Just last year, authorities continued demolishing church crosses and beating protesters bloody. Government officials came out in large numbers to put down protesters of the program, armed with riot gear and prepared to use force.Ever since Xi Jinping took power as Chinese Communist Party General Secretary in 2012, the Party has tightened restrictions on religious practice. Since then, more and more believers are opting out of official, state-sanctioned religious organizations and moving their faith underground.Follow Thomas D.

April 3 (UPI) — Christian churchgoers in China were recently wounded after fighting with officials enforcing new regulations: the installation of surveillance cameras inside churches.The ordinance to place closed-circuit television cameras in Protestant and Roman Catholic churches was issued in late 2016 by authorities in Zhejiang Province, South China Morning Post reported Monday.The law comes two years after Chinese authorities ordered churches in the coastal province to remove conspicuous neon crosses from buildings, a movement that began in 2014, according to the report.The Christian population in provinces like Zhejiang is growing, now numbering 1 million. In 2015, a conservative estimate placed the total number of Christians in China at 23 million.In the city of Wenzhou, Christians vehemently opposed to camera surveillance clashed with authorities.“Government officials came to the churches and put up cameras by force. Some pastors and worshipers who didn’t agree to the move were dragged away,” one unidentified Christian in Wenzhou said, referring to a recent clash. “Some people needed to be treated in a hospital after fighting the officials.”The price of resistance is high.Huang Yizi, a pastor who was jailed in 2015 for standing up against the removal of crosses, said he is now being closely watched after telling foreign reporters of the camera installations in March.According to China Aid, a U.S.-based religious rights group, churches were required to place cameras at church gates, rostrums and offering boxes.Worshipers in China are confused about the policy.“We Christians do good deeds and we don’t do anything to endanger the public. I don’t understand why the government wants to monitor us,” one churchgoer said.








On his weekly television program Sunday, Maduro told the story of an alleged environmental fraud involving a hippopotamus in El Salvador and compared the incident to the story of Ruperta, the only African elephant in Venezuela.Ruperta, who lives at the Caricuao Zoo in Caracas, is reportedly suffering from severe malnutrition, and photos of the emaciated elephant began to circulate on social media after a local journalist began disseminating them.“Two weeks ago they began to discuss the beloved elephant Ruperta,” Maduro said on his program. “She is at an advanced age. They wrote a whole novel, a show and on social media groups begin to say bad things to demoralize the people and children with this.”“They put those messages out on Sunday evenings and at night to ruin your week, but citizens need to know how to confront this war to drive young people crazy, crazy with hate,” Maduro concluded.Maduro accused the media – without specifying whom it is that is attempting to demoralize the country – of “affecting the psyche” of Venezuelans by exposing the starving animal to the world.Ruperta is either 45 or 46 years old, according to various reports. The average African elephant lives between 65-70 years in captivity, making Ruperta of middle, but not “advanced,” age.Maduro has previously dismissed the growing food crisis in Venezuela, which inches every day closer to famine, on his television program in the past. In September, Maduro joked about the food crisis’s nickname among Venezuelans: the “Maduro diet.”“Maduro’s diet gets you hard – no need for Viagra!” Maduro said on national television, complimenting a soldier for appearing thin.A poll released in February found that three of four Venezuelan lost nearly 20 pounds in 2016. Over 90 percent of Venezuelans cannot secure three meals a day for themselves, and an estimated 15 percent of Venezuelans rely on scavenging through commercial garbage for food.The animals at Caricuao have not been immune to the food crisis, with Ruperta its most famous animal victim.Ruperta, la elefante desnutrida símbolo de la crisis alimentaria en Venezuela https://t.co/2Uwln6fi1t pic.twitter.com/KO5Xd6Ue1y— Publimetro (@PublimetroChile) April 3, 2017Ruperta, la elefante del Zoológico de Caricuao, fue asistida por desnutrición https://t.co/sKgDmancGz pic.twitter.com/Nnm8qJrlgj— NTN24 Venezuela (@NTN24ve) March 26, 2017Officials at the zoo have denied that Ruperta is emaciated, instead claiming that she has been suffering dehydration and diarrhea after eating too much squash and have ceded the elephant has lost a significant percentage of her weight. The squash itself, however, was provided as alternative nutrition in light of the growing food crisis in the country.“We have enough food and the animals at Caricuao are well-fed,” chief zookeeper Erick Lenarduzzi told reporters.The reporter who broke the story, Román Camacho, refuted the official zoo version of events, telling the Miami Herald that a zookeeper at Caricuao alerted him to the deteriorating state of the elephant and stated malnutrition was to blame.The Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional reported last week that, despite the dire food situation in the country, the zoo’s neighbors organized a food collection for Ruperta, collecting food fit for elephant consumption: carrots, oranges, pineapples, and chard, among other local vegetables. Denying that she was suffering from malnutrition, zoo officials rejected the food donations.According to El Nacional, Ruperta is not alone. A puma resident of the zoo died in February after zookeepers reportedly used expired anesthetic medications to subdue the animal. A month earlier, officials reportedly removed the zoo’s jaguar from display due to apparent signs of malnutrition.Economics, Environment, National Security, Animal Abuse, Animal Rights, elephant, Environment, Latin America, Nicolas Maduro, socialism, Venezuela, Venezuela food crisis, Zoo








According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Romo plans to trade in the pigskin for a microphone:Tony Romo is leaving football and going into broadcasting, even with Dallas planning to release him today, sources tell @toddarcher and me.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) April 4, 2017Soon after Schefter’s initial report, Schefter tweeted that the rumored hiring of Romo as color analyst at CBS had become official:Tony Romo is going to CBS, as @Ourand_SBJ reported. Will be CBS’ No. 1 color analyst, matched with Jim Nantz.— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) April 4, 2017The move will result in Romo replacing longtime color analyst Phil Simms on CBS’s lead broadcast team, meaning that Romo will get paired with Jim Nantz. Fox and NBC had also reportedly approached Romo about joining their broadcast teams.Those broadcasting opportunities, coupled with concern over his health and what became an extremely difficult trade market in which teams like the Texans and Broncos refused to surrender draft picks, no doubt pushed Romo towards pursuing a career in the booth.However, even all those factors don’t mean Romo will never play again.While Romo obviously had difficulty finding another team to go to via trade, by leaving the field altogether, in a sense he’s become the ultimate hired-gun free agent. Meaning, that when a team in playoff contention loses a starting quarterback late in the year, Tony Romo will almost automatically become the first call when looking for a replacement.For now, though, Tony Romo will learn broadcasting and replace Phil Simms as the color analyst on CBS’s lead broadcast team. We now go to a live shot of the average American sports fan, as he reflects on the possibility of a future without Phil Simms in the booth:Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinnBreitbart Sports, Dallas Cowboys, Tony Romo








In a survey of 1,363 current and former ESPN viewers, taken between March 7 and March 14, sports media analyst Jason Barrett asked for perspectives on the network’s political slant, in addition to thoughts on ESPN’s current programming and how those views have changed over time.The results go a long way towards explaining why the network is folding faster than a prefab in a Category-5 hurricane.When asked, “How would you describe ESPN’s political influence on its programs?” a whopping 60.8% of respondents referred to the network’s political influence as “left leaning.” Only 3% characterized the influence as “right leaning.”When asked, “How do you feel about the current state of ESPN’s TV programs?” an incredible 97.2% of people said that they feel less enthusiastic about it, with a solid majority of 69.9% saying that they either “hate” the TV lineup and don’t watch anymore, or consider it “weak” and have lost interest.In a part of the survey which sheds light on ESPN’s decision to layoff nearly 50 on-air personalities, respondents were asked which area of ESPN’s programming they valued the least. A full 63. 1% said they valued the debate shows least. Another 17.5% said they valued SportsCenter the least. That’s a combined 80.6% devaluing the two areas where nearly all of ESPN’s on-air talent spends their time. Not coincidentally, SportsCenter and the debate shows are also the two areas rumored to get hardest hit by ESPN’s impending layoffs.Barrett concludes his survey results by saying, “Survey members who say they’re investing less time in the network’s programming attribute it to a Decrease In Content Quality and Talent, Better Choices Available via TV-Digital-Social, and Too Much Focus on Hot Take Shows with a Left Leaning Agenda and Less on Making Sports Fun and Neutral. Deflategate was another specific subject which turned off many fans.”In his article on the results of Barrett’s survey, Alex Putterman of Awful Announcing absurdly claims that those who believe ESPN has become too liberal believe so, in part, because ESPN has allowed black people and women to speak their minds:A lot of the “ESPN is too liberal” sentiment surely has to do with which voices the network chooses to amplify. ESPN has clearly made an effort in recent years to let women and people of color share their opinions outside of the Xs and Os studio show format. After years of ESPN personalities defending management and espousing personal responsibility (which are conservative perspectives, whether you think of them that way or not), the network is giving the Bomani Jones and Jemele Hills of the world a bigger platform, and not everyone is thrilled.Whether intentional or not, this dismissive slight has the effect of smearing those who believe ESPN has become too liberal by labeling them as racists. If Bomani Jones and Jemele Hill were the only openly liberal agitators at ESPN, minority or otherwise, there’s no way you would get a poll with nearly 61% of people characterizing the network as too “left leaning.”It also ignores the fact that when many conservatives mention sports media types with a strong liberal bias, the names that normally come up include personalities like Bob Costas (not black) and, when he was in sports, Keith Olbermann (still not black).Nor did people just begin viewing ESPN as “too liberal” in relatively recent years, after the network began featuring more outspoken female and minority voices. In truth, many conservatives have long since felt abandoned by ESPN.On the contrary, the bias at ESPN is organizational, systemic, and not based on individual personalities at all.This is the same network that allowed the ESPYs to turn into an anti-Second Amendment infomercial, allowed their social media sites to be used as a platform for leftist activists at the Women’s March, declined to fire Tony Kornheiser for likening House Republicans to ISIS while at the same time firing Curt Schilling for a common sense message shared on Facebook, and forced Rush Limbaugh to resign for saying something about Donovan McNabb which even liberals acknowledged to be true.There is a systemic bias here that runs a lot deeper and a lot higher up the food chain than Jemele Hill and Bomani Jones. So, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that the leftist sports media would respond to the charge of liberal bias by calling people racists.It’s pretty much all they do.Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinnBreitbart Sports, ESPN








Alex Ovechkin and other players aren’t so sure the NHL’s decision to skip the Winter Olympics in South Korea next year is final.The Washington Capitals superstar on Tuesday reiterated his intention to represent Russia next February, calling the league’s decision a “bluff.” Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price, who won gold with Canada in Sochi in 2014, wondered if the announcement was part of the league’s negotiating “tactics.” Matt Duchene of the Colorado Avalanche suggested it could simply be “posturing.”The NHL insisted Monday that the matter is “officially closed” as it slammed the door on the Olympics for the first time since 1994. But a host of questions remain, from how national teams will fill their rosters to just how the league will deal with players like Ovechkin who plan to go anyway. Most players know nothing of the days when the NHL wasn’t part of the Games, so the news that they won’t get that chance in Pyeongchang didn’t sit well at rinks around North America.Swedish forward Filip Forsberg of the Nashville Predators called it a “terrible decision” that he hopes changes. Pittsburgh star Sidney Crosby echoed Mike Babcock, his coach for consecutive Olympic gold medals with Team Canada, by calling it disappointing.“When you begin negotiations and things like that, I really thought something was going to be able to get worked out and unfortunately that’s not the case,” Crosby said. “From what I heard it was kind (of) typical negotiations, then it kind of came out of nowhere (Monday) with the announcement.”Crosby said there’s “always that possibility” that the door remains open for a deal to get worked out. Statements by the NHL Players’ Association, International Ice Hockey Federation and International Olympic Committee made no references to continued negotiations, however, and the NHL said previous talks had gone nowhere on issues believed to include better marketing tied to the Olympics — something the IOC allows only for top top-tier sponsors.The quality of competition certainly will suffer next winter, but just what NHL players can do about it isn’t clear.“I’m curious if some of these guys are going to go,” 1980 gold-medal-winning U.S. captain Mike Eruzione said. “Ovechkin says he’s going. Will Patrick Kane say he’s going? Will Sidney say he’s going? Will Connor McDavid, Jack Eichel — some of these great young players that play now — are they going to say, ‘The (heck) with you, I’m going?’ That’s going to be really interesting.”American winger Zach Parise of the Minnesota Wild predicts a lot of controversy if players go to South Korea anyway against the NHL’s wishes and possibly those of their owners. Czech winger Jakub Voracek of the Philadelphia Flyers called it a no-win situation because players will either be abandoning their NHL teams or unable to help their national teams.The NHL hasn’t yet decided whether to allow individual teams to let players go on a case-by-case basis. Capitals owner Ted Leonsis said in February he expects to be punished if he allows Ovechkin and other players go but would be fine with that. Crosby said he hasn’t yet thought about whether he’d go to the Olympics anyway.Swedish winger Gabriel Landeskog of the Colorado Avalanche said Tuesday he’d consider pulling an Ovechkin and going but doesn’t expect this to be the end of debate.Hockey Canada and USA Hockey get millions each year from the NHL, making it difficult to imagine many North American players under contract in the league would be allowed on those rosters.There’s nothing in the collective bargaining agreement guaranteeing Olympic participation, though that could change if owners or players opt out at their next opportunity in September 2019. For now there’s nothing in the CBA barring players from leaving their teams — potentially on unpaid suspensions — to go, so Ovechkin isn’t budging.“Somebody going to tell me, like, don’t go, I don’t care — I just go,” he said.___AP Sports Writers Will Graves in Pittsburgh, Teresa M.

A coalition airstrike on that day had targeted a building with ISIS fighters holed up inside, after Iraqi forces coming under strong fire called for coalition air support. Initial reports blamed the strike for collapsing a building that killed civilians in a nearby building.But an Iraqi military spokesman told DoD News, a Pentagon-run news service, that an examination of the site of the blast showed that an airstrike did not collapse the building; rather it fell due to a nearby ISIS bomb-laden vehicle at the time of the strike.“There was no hole in the building,” Saeed al-Jayashi, a spokesman for the Iraqi military, told reporters traveling in Iraq with Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The strike was 100-percent accurate and it was correct.”He also said the size of the weapon dropped could not have caused the kind of damage Iraqi troops found at the site.However, Iraqi officials said the airstrike did set off the car bomb, which took out the whole block and killed 61 civilians. They also said people in the neighborhood told Iraqi forces that ISIS forced people into the collapsed building and made them stay.The Iraqi officials’ assertions echo those made by U.S. military officials in recent days, that the coalition airstrike may not have caused the collapse of the building and the civilians deaths by itself.The airstrike had triggered immense pressure and public scrutiny on the U.S. military, particularly over whether the Trump administration has loosened rules of engagement on how U.S. troops fight against ISIS.Commanders say the rules have not changed since December under the Obama administration. Those rule changes allowed commanders at lower levels to approve airstrikes against ISIS targets versus having to go up the chain of command to higher-up commanders, which takes more time.Officials say those rule changes have nothing to do with the civilian casualties that occurred on March 17.“A rigorous process remains in place, even at the delegated level,” said spokesman Army Col. Joe Scrocca during a recent telephone briefing with reporters.“These ROE changes did not remove any protections for civilians or allow the targeting of civilian buildings,” he said Thursday.Scrocca also said ISIS is smuggling civilians into buildings and trying to bait the coalition into attacking the buildings to take advantage of the public outcry and deter action in the future.He said the coalition caught the ISIS tactic on video and is working to declassify it.The U.S.-led coalition is currently undergoing a formal investigation into the March 17 airstrike to review whether correct procedures were followed.Jayashi said Iraqi investigators are still working to uncover the complete truth and will submit their full report to the prime minister soon.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, ISIS, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Mosul, West Mosul








The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group put the death toll at 58, saying there were 11 children among the dead. Meanwhile, the Idlib Media Center said dozens of people had been killed.The media center published footage of medical workers appearing to intubate an unresponsive man stripped down to his underwear and hooking up a little girl foaming at the mouth to a ventilator.There was no comment from the government in Damascus or any international agency in the immediate aftermath of the attack.It was the third claim of a chemical attack in just over a week in Syria. The previous two were reported in Hama province, in an area not far from Khan Sheikhoun, the site of Tuesday’s alleged attack.Tuesday’s reports came on the eve of a major international meeting in Brussels on the future of Syria and the region, to be hosted by the EU’s High Representative Federica Mogherini.The Syrian American Medical Society, which supports hospitals in opposition-held territory, said it had sent a team of inspectors to Khan Sheikhoun before noon and an investigation was underway.The Syrian activists had no information on what agent could have been used in the assault. They claimed the attack was caused by an airstrike carried out either by the Syrian government or Russian warplanes.It was also not immediately clear if all those killed died from suffocation or wounds sustained in the airstrikes.Makeshift hospitals soon crowded with people suffocating, activist said.Mohammed Hassoun, a media activist in nearby Sarmin — also in Idlib province where some of the critical cases were transferred — said the hospital there is equipped to deal with such chemical attacks because the town was also struck, early on in the Syrian uprising. The Sarmin hospital is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) away from the scene of the attack.“Because of the number of wounded, they have been distributed around in rural Idlib,” he told The Associated Press by phone. “There are 18 critical cases here. They were unconscious, they had seizures and when oxygen was administered, they bled from the nose and mouth.”Hassoun, who is documenting the attack for the medical society, said the doctors there have said it is likely more than one gas.“Chlorine gas doesn’t cause such convulsions,” he said, adding that doctors suspect sarin was used.Hussein Kayal, a photographer for the Idlib Media Center, said he was awoken by the sound of a bomb blast around 6:30 a.m. When he arrived at the scene there was no smell, he said.He found entire families inside their homes, lying on the floor, eyes wide open and unable to move. Their pupils were constricted. He put on a mask, he said. Kayal said he and other witnesses took victims to an emergency room, and removed their clothes and washed them in water.He said he felt a burning sensation in his fingers and was treated for that.A Turkey-based Syrian man whose niece, her husband and one-year-old daughter were among those killed, said the warplanes struck early, as residents were still in their beds. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared for the safety of family members back in Syria.The province of Idlib is almost entirely controlled by the Syrian opposition. It is home to some 900,000 displaced Syrians, according to the United Nations. Rebels and opposition officials have expressed concerns that the government is planning to mount a concentrated attack on the crowded province.Claims of chemical weapons attacks, particularly the use of the chlorine agent, are not uncommon in Syria’s conflict. The worst attack was what a U.N. report said was an attack by toxic sarin gas in August 2013 on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta that killed hundreds of civilians.The Syrian Coalition, an opposition group based outside the country, said government planes carried out the airstrike on Khan Sheikhoun, south of the city of Idlib, the provincial capital.It said the planes fired missiles carrying poisonous gases, killing dozens of people, many of them women and children. The coalition described the attack as a “horrifying massacre.”Photos and video emerging from Khan Sheikhoun show limp bodies of children and adults. Some are seen struggling to breathe; others appear foaming at the mouth.A medical doctor going by the name of Dr. Shajul Islam for fears for his own safety said his hospital in Idlib province received three victims, all with narrow, pinpoint pupils that did not respond to light. He published video of the patients on his Twitter account.Pinpoint pupils, breathing difficulties, and foaming at the mouth are symptoms commonly associated with toxic gas exposure.The opposition’s Civil Defense search-and-rescue group, which released photos showing paramedics washing down victims, has not published a casualty toll.The activist-run Assi Press published video of paramedics carrying victims from the scene by a pickup truck. The victims were stripped down to their underwear. Many appeared unresponsive.The New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused the Syrian government of conducting at least eight chemical attacks using chlorine gas on opposition-controlled residential areas during the final months in the battle for Aleppo last year that killed at least nine civilians and injured 200.Also, a joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog determined the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.Breitbart Jerusalem, Jihad, National Security, Chemical Warfare, gas attack, Idlib, Syria civil war, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights








The Interfax report drew on a law enforcement source who also said that that an investigation of the blast scene suggested that a suicide bomber was responsible for the explosion that killed 14 people and injured 49 more.Kyrgyzstan’s security service GKNB identified the suspected bomber as Akbarzhon Jalilov, a 22-year-old Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen. The GKNB also said that the Islamic State may have been involved in the terror attack.Kyrgyzstan was a Soviet republic until it gained its independence in 1991. The mostly Muslim country with a population of some six million is a close political ally of Russia. Kyrgyzstan’s security services said they are “maintaining contact with the Russian secret service for further investigation.”Not long after the bombing, Islamic State supporters began celebrating the attack on social media, although they have not yet claimed responsibility for the act.One ISIS supporter claimed that the attacks were carried out in revenge for Russia’s backing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s fight against ISIS and other rebel groups in Syria’s civil war.The Islamic State recently published a poster showing a jihadi blowing up the Kremlin, accompanied by the message “kill them where you find them.”Russia’s transport infrastructure has been repeatedly targeted by Islamist terror groups based in the North Caucasus over the past two decades.In October, 2015, a bomb on board a civilian airliner travelling from Sharm el-Sheikh to Saint Petersburg killed 224 people, many of them Russians on holiday.On that occasion, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, calling it retaliation for Russia’s military intervention in Syria.Follow Thomas D.

Thabet left her native Yemen in the wake of armed conflict between the government, Houthis rebels, and terrorist groups– including the local affiliate of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), or Ansar al Sharia.For many years, Thabet worked with the United Nations and other non-government international agencies to help boys as young as nine years old regain their lives and rejoin their family and larger community. She also helped young girls who married terrorists in a country with high poverty and no laws banning child marriage.“When we are approaching any case, we are not just only collecting evidence, we are trying to approach those cases as a human being,” Thabet told Breitbart News during her visit to Washington, D.C. last week to be honored at the International Women of Courage event at the State Department. “We are not considering them as cases, we’re considering them as kids.”“So it’s a long relationship that we are trying to build,” Fadia said.The relationship is built by offering the children and their families counseling, financial aid and in some cases prosthetics for boys who lost limbs or suffered other disabling injuries on the battlefield.Most communities welcome back their boys, Thabet said.“Because they are children, it is really emotional and moving,” Thabet said. “So they will forgive very quickly.”“They know they’ve been brainwashed,” said Thabet, adding that terrorists easily attract children with promises of money, weapons, and status.She said that the Yemeni government had agreed to a U.N. Plan of Action to make 18 the legal age for military service, but the latest outbreak of war that began in 2015 has put off its implementation.“We had our allies in the government and we also had our enemies,” Fadia said. “Nothing now functions because of the war.”According to Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2017, children have been devastated by the armed conflict in Yemen:The UN secretary-general included the Houthis, government forces, pro-government militias, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and, for the first time, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition on his annual ‘list of shame’  for grave violations against children during armed conflict.The coalition was responsible for 60 percent of the 785 children killed and 1,168 children wounded, and nearly half of the 101 attacks on schools and hospitals, according to the report.Houthi forces, government and pro-government forces, and other armed groups have used child soldiers, an estimated one-third of the fighters in Yemen. The UN found in 2015 that 72 percent of 762 verified cases of child recruitment were attributable to the Houthis, with an overall five-fold increase in recruitment of children and a shift towards forced or involuntary recruitment.Under Yemeni law, 18 is the minimum age for military service. In 2014, the government signed a UN action plan to end the use of child soldiers. Without an effective government in place, the action plan has not been implemented.The Middle East Eye reported on Friday that al-Qaeda’s presence is growing in Yemen, including in the city of Taiz, but the makeup of those involved in the conflict is complicated.Ten groups are fighting under the banner of the Popular Resistance in Yemen, including the Salafis, Muhamashin, and al-Qaeda, all united against the Houthis rebels.“Taiz is not a stronghold of al-Qaeda and we did not hear any mention of al-Qaeda in Taiz before the war,” a source told the MEE. “But there are some members of al-Qaeda who have come to Taiz from the southern provinces during the last two years.”“Now they have spread to the east of the city,” the source said.Jihad, Middle East, National Security, al Qaeda in Yemen, children soldiers, Human Rights Watch, terrorism, United Nations








The figure rose from the overnight number of 11 Tuesday morning to 14, with 11 having died at the scene and three from critical injuries later in the day. Of the 49 injured 12 remain in serious condition and 27 are in “moderate” condition, reports Russian news agency RIA Novosti.Nearly 24 hours after the attack, Russian authorities are still working to make sense of the attack with conflicting reports of packages having been left on trains and of an Islamist suicide attack. In addition to the one detonation that took place between subway stops at the central square and the city technical university, a second pipe bomb was discovered unexploded at Ploschad station, according to reports.While images were released in Russian media on Monday of an older bearded man in typical central Asian clothing, reports from Russian news agency Interfax Tuesday reported law enforcement sources which claimed a 22-year-old Kyrgyzstan-born citizen suicide bomber was responsible. Citing the Kyrgyz intelligence agency, the agency claimed Akbarzhon Jalilov, a resident of Osh in western Kyrgyzstan may have been in contact with the Islamic State.Russian security sources said a “fragment” of the man who could have detonated the bomb has been found in the carriage.Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the attack showed the need for international efforts to fight global terrorism, remarking: “[the attack] once again shows the importance of stepping up joint efforts to combat this evil”. In separate comments on Monday evening, the Russian foreign minister said he regretted the process of the United States forming their new government meant efforts to build dialogue between the two nations had been inevitably delayed.Despite that, he said: “we expect a frank and useful conversation that would be in line with the intentions expressed by our presidents during their telephone calls, the latest of which took place yesterday evening”, reports the TASS news agency.Breitbart London, Jihad, Russia, Saint Petersburg, terrorism








Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In conjunction with the committee vote on Gorsuch—who was recommended favorably to the Senate by a party-line 11-9 vote—Coons announced that he would join Schumer’s filibuster.Coons is a liberal Democrat, but had previously signaled that he might consider some sort of negotiated outcome regarding the way forward for the high Court. So while his announcement was not unexpected, it was still vitally important.With Coons, there are now 41 votes for a filibuster. It takes 60 votes to stop a filibuster in the 100-member Senate, so Coons became the magic number that puts Schumer over the top.Under current Senate practice, that body’s rules are interpreted such that President Trump’s nomination of Gorsuch would now die, despite having a bipartisan majority of at least 55 senators who would vote for him if his confirmation comes to a final vote.Now all eyes are on Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), to see if he can keep enough of his 52 Republicans together to invoke the constitutional option, and restore the 200-year Senate practice of judicial nominees only requiring a simple majority vote to be confirmed to their lifetime appointments.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that filibustering Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court is a “totally illogical” move Democrats are pursuing because they’re responding to the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” of their base.Krauthammer said, “[I]t makes no sense. It’s totally illogical if you’re a Democrat. The fight is going to be over the next nominee. As you say, this nominee does not alter the balance of the court ideologically. The next very well could, whether it’s a Kennedy, or a Ginsburg, or a Breyer, it could be a radical change, a semi-radical if it’s a Kennedy, and that would have an effect. And you’d expect the Democrats to want to save their ammunition, but they are expending it here.”He added, “I think they are, in some ways, suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, in the sense that they might not be personally deranged by his presence, but they have a base that has not recovered from the election, and they insist that anybody who represents them and does not want to face a primary fight, or have a demonstration outside their house on a weekend, is — will oppose what Trump is doing. This is about Trump. It isn’t about Gorsuch. And that I think, is their motive for doing it, but it makes no sense because, if this is the first partisan filibuster, it will be the last.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchettBreitbart TV, Charles Krauthammer, Filibuster, Neil Gorsuch, nuclear option, Supreme Court








Thomas, 68, would break the record in 2028, which means he would have served 37 years on the court, the Washington Examiner reported.The current record-holder for longest-serving justice is William O. Douglas, a Franklin D. Roosevelt pick who served on the court for 36 years.An actuarial report said Thomas would be the first justice to serve more than 40 years if he stays on the court until he’s 83.The report shows that future presidents will not get a chance to nominate Supreme Court justices as often, citing Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch as an example of a trend that shows that if younger justices are nominated to the Supreme Court, the less often presidents will be able to appoint new justices due to lifetime appointment rules.The report even suggests that two-term presidents may not even get a chance to nominate a justice at all.An average of 49 justices are named to the Supreme Court every 100 years, but with younger justices, that average goes down to 25 every 100 years, according to the report.The Oliver Wyman firm, the group that authored this report, did a study on the impact of an 18-year term limit and found that the appointment rate would return to 49 every 100 years.It also said that this would increase the chances that a single president would be responsible for naming the majority of Supreme Court justices that serve over a 100-year period.Big Government, Pre-Viral, courts, longest-serving justice, Oliver Wyman firm, Supreme Court, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas








On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “OutFront,” anchor Erin Burnett stated that Democrats in the Senate have flipped their position on whether the Supreme Court can function with eight Supreme Court justices.Burnett said there were “choice comments that were made last year when Republicans blocked Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination, Dana. Democrats, at the time, said, a court without nine justices is a crisis. We can’t have it. We can’t have it.”Burnett then played clips of Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) arguing that the Supreme Court needed nine justices. After the montage was complete, Burnett added, “And yet now Dana, it’s the Democrats who are essentially forcing the court to go even longer with only eight.”(h/t Mediaite)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchettBreitbart TV, Erin Burnett, Neil Gorsuch, Supreme Court








Last week Collins said Gorsuch was “unquestionably qualified” for the Supreme Court, and that by trying to filibuster President Trump’s chosen successor to Antonin Scalia, Senate Democrats were “playing politics with judicial nominees,” damaging the Senate as an institution and in the eyes of the American people. A bipartisan majority of 55 senators have pledged to vote to confirm Gorsuch.Now that it is official that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has the 41 votes necessary to sustain a filibuster to block Gorsuch—in fact, he now has 42, with another four undecided—Collins is suggesting she might support the constitutional option.“First of all, I think it’s important to recognize that there is absolutely no basis for filibustering such an eminently qualified nominee,” Collins said. “And I am very troubled by the fact that the Democrats have put us in this situation.”Senate Democrats forced through a new precedent in 2013 that filibusters do not apply to lower federal court nominees. In terms of whether she would support a procedural ruling that this precedent—the constitutional option—also applies to nominees for the Supreme Court, Collins added, “If it’s necessary in order to get him confirmed I may have to vote that way, but I certainly don’t want to.”If Collins votes for the ruling, McConnell needs two of the following four senators to get to 50: John McCain (R-AZ), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Bob Corker (R-TN), and Lamar Alexander (R-TN). Some of them have expressed concerns, but none have taken an express position one way or the other.Once there are 50 votes, Vice President Mike Pence can cast the tie-breaking vote to invoke the constitutional option, followed by a vote to confirm Gorsuch. A vote on the constitutional option is expected on Friday.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Monday on MSNBC while discussing Senate Democrats opposition to President Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Republicans have “no other choice” than the nuclear option of lowering the 60-vote filibuster threshold for a Supreme Court nominee to a simple majority.Partial transcript as follows:REPORTER: Mitch McConnell, the leader is prepared to go nuclear here?GRAHAM: Yeah. We have no other choice.

Although most dictionaries define “mankind” as “the human race,” which is gender inclusive, Northern Arizona University Professor Anne Scott is sending a message to a student who dared to use the word that Scott believes is “sexist,” in a recent essay.“I would be negligent, as a professor who is running a class about the human condition and the assumptions we make about being ‘human,’ if I did not also raise this issue of gendered language and ask my students to respect the need for gender-neutral language,” Scott wrote in an email to the student about her grade. “The words we use matter very much, or else teachers would not be making an issue of this at all, and the MLA would not be making recommendations for gender-neutral language at the national level.”Scott specifically cites the use of “mankind” as the reason why the student lost one point out of 50 on a recent English essay in her “Critical Reading and Writing in the University Community” course.The student, Caitlin Jeffers, claims that Professor Scott instructed students to avoid using gender-specific language at the beginning of the semester. Jeffers claim that she wished to test the policy to see if Scott would actually lower her grade on an assignment due to the use of gender-specific language.After receiving her grade on the essay, Jeffers said she requested a meeting with Scott to address her decision to police the language of her students.“She told me that ‘mankind’ does not refer to all people, only males. I refuted, stating that it does refer to all people, [but] she proceeded to tell me that I was wrong; ‘mankind’ is sexist, and I should make an effort to look beyond my preset positions and ideologies, as is the focus of the class,” Jeffers claimed.Scott offered Jeffers the opportunity to rework the essay to increase her grade, noting that she must remove the word “mankind” to do so.“I will respect your choice to leave your diction choices ‘as is’ and to make whatever political and linguistic statement you want to make by doing so,” the professor wrote. “By the same token, I will still need to subtract a point because your choice will not be made in the letter or spirit of this particular class, which is all about having you and other students looking beneath your assumptions and understanding that ‘mankind’ does not mean ‘all people’ to all people. It positively does not.”Scott reportedly also sent an email to the class that she will continue to dock points from students’ work when it uses gender-specific language.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

The campaign, which launches on Tuesday, also claims on their site that “Black and Hispanic women are paid even less” before offering women 20% off discounts for a range of services in protest.Several companies have partnered with the campaign, including the popular ride-sharing app Lyft, which will donate 20% of revenue to “organizations that serve women and families” on April 4.“At Lyft, we celebrate a diverse and inclusive culture, and we participate to make change happen — whether that’s at work or in the car,” the company wrote in a post on their website. “That’s why we’re teaming up with LeanIn.Org on their #20PercentCounts campaign and donating 20% of proceeds from rides taken between 8 AM and 6 PM on April 4 to organizations that serve women and families, including Dress for Success®, Feeding America, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and AAUW.”P&G, whose brands include Gillette, Pantene, Always, and Secret, will also be offering a rebate on their products.“Women on average are paid 20% less than men — and when you look at the data by race and ethnicity, it is even worse: black women are paid 37% less, and Hispanic women are paid 46% less,” claim P&G on their website. “To raise awareness about the gender pay gap, P&G is offering a 20% rebate via pre-paid card on $50 worth of P&G products.”“P&G believes in equal pay for women. Through our brands, and as a company, we aspire to help build a world free from gender bias,” they continued. “We’re proud to support this campaign to raise awareness of the pay gap with LeanIn.Org.”Despite the campaign’s claims that women are routinely paid less than men, it is against the law for employers to discriminate based on sex and has been since 1963.Claims that women are paid less than men have frequently been dismissed by economic experts, journalists, and scholars.LeanIn.org currently have a full list of companies around the United States that are offering special offers for women as part of the campaign.Economics, Social Justice, Tech, facebook, LeanIn.org, Lyft, P&G, Sheryl Sandberg, Wage Gap








More specifically, the trio was charged with “insulting the Prophet” and “insulting the Supreme Leader of Iran” with text messages, per the UK Daily Mail. Evidently, insulting the Supreme Leader only gets you 16 months in jail but insulting Mohammed is a capital offense. The Center for Human Rights in Iran notes that if a person accused of insulting Mohammed claims his words were due to “anger” or a “mistake,” the court can reduce the sentence to 74 lashes instead of death.Dehghan was sentenced to death, even though the CHRI says he was told he would receive a pardon if he confessed to his “crimes” and repented of his actions. The Center notes he only had four days remaining in his military service at the time of his arrest.A source told the CHRI:Security and judicial authorities promised Sina’s family that if they didn’t make any noise about his case, he would have a better chance of being freed, and that talking about it to the media would work against him. Unfortunately, the family believed those words and stopped sharing information about his case and discouraged others from sharing it as well.One of his co-defendants was given a seven-year prison sentence reduced to three years on appeal, while the other, Mohammad Nouri, has also been sentenced to death.According to the UK Independent, the exact content of the messages sent by the three defendants on the Line messaging application has not been made public.Dehghan has been held in the notorious Arak prison where a source told the CHRI he is “suffering from depression and often cries.” The source also said Dehghan is “held in a ward with drug convicts and murderers who broke his jaw a while ago.”He is running out of options to escape the death sentence, which was upheld by the Iranian Supreme Court in January. In an interview on March 28th, Dehghan’s lawyer said a request for judicial review of his sentence has been filed.“According to Sina’s lawyer, steps have been taken for a judicial review, and with the good news we’re hearing from him, God willing this case will come to end positively as soon as possible,” said Dehghan’s mother.However, another human-rights organization called Article 19 has complained Dehghan’s court-appointed lawyer “failed to adequately defend him” at trial.Article 19 said the case demonstrates how Iranians are “at the mercy of a system where forced confessions, false promises, and threats to family members undermine not only national judicial processes but the international standards Iran has signed up to.”Faith, Middle East, National Security, blasphemy laws, Execution, Iran, Iranian Supreme Leader, Islam








Paul called the reports that Rice made dozens of requests to learn more about the identities of anonymous people thought to be close to the Trump transition team, inadvertently caught on tape during investigations into foreign persons of intelligence interest, “enormous news.”“If it is allowed, we shouldn’t be allowing it. I don’t think we should discount how big a deal it is that Susan rice was looking at these,” Paul told the assembled reporters.The Kentucky Senator then cut to the heart of the growing political fight behind what President Trump has called “wiretapping.”“She needs to be asked, ‘did President Obama ask her to do this?’ I think she ought to testify under oath on this,” Paul opined.Paul also tried to tie Monday’s revelations about Rice to the slew of leaks on the topic around the time of the handover of the White House. “I think she should be asked under oath, did she reveal it to the Washington Post?” he asked.Paul, long a critic of this type of warrentless intelligence wiretapping and its potential to capture the communications of American citizens, was quick to tie the issues together. “I don’t think you should be allowed to listen to Americans’ conversations without a warrant,” Paul said. “They are targeting a foreigner, and because they are targeting a foreigner they are gathering all of this information on Americans.”“A million Americans are apparently caught up in these incidental conversations,” Paul continued. “Everybody in the Trump Administration transition, they could basically look at those conversations.”Big Government, Data, Obama, Donald Trump, fisa, Rand Paul, Susan Rice, wiretapping








Cernovich reported Sunday evening that Rice had requested the “unmasking” of incoming Trump officials, which refers to the identification of Americans incidentally caught up in surveillance of foreign targets.The revelation, reported first by Cernovich Sunday evening, showed Rice, a member of the Obama administration, had viewed communications involving incoming Trump administration officials — albeit not “wire tapping” as Trump had specifically asserted.Trump critics and former Obama NSC officials did not dispute the report, but argued that Rice did nothing “illegal.”Trump administration officials have not argued that unmasking was “illegal,” only that leaking to media the identities of those unmasked was illegal, which happened to then-incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.4.

But by then, Obama’s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told NBC News on March 5 that there was no evidence of any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.Still, Flynn’s name and the contents of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak — which were classified — were leaked to the Washington Post and published in a February 9 article.And from non-conservative news outlets on the new Rice revelation, mostly silence.Breaking: The media's reaction to the unmasking #SusanRice #tcot #ccot #RedNationRising #wakeupAmerica pic.twitter.com/HNey7iTJX2— Rad123 (@Tombx7M) April 3, 2017Big Government, National Security, Susan Rice, Trump, unmasking








by Neil W. McCabe3 Apr 2017Capitol Hill0Intelligence sources said the logs discovered by National Security Council staff suggested Rice’s interest in the NSA materials, some of which included unmasked Americans’ identities, appeared to begin last July around the time Trump secured the GOP nomination and accelerated after Trump’s election in November launched a transition that continued through January.The intelligence reports included some intercepts of Americans talking to foreigners and many more involving foreign leaders talking about the future president, his campaign associates or his transition, the sources said. Most if not all had nothing to do with the Russian election interference scandal, the sources said, speaking only on condition of anonymity given the sensitive nature of the materials.When intelligence or law enforcement agencies accidentally gather information related to American citizens, outside their legally sanctioned collection mission, the data appears in reports with simple labels, such as American 1 or American 2. However, when the reports were circulated inside the Obama administration, the actual names were used, or unmasked, or labelled in a way that made the speaker’s identity obvious.The report written by Sara Carter and John Solomon also quotes an intelligence source, who said it is the common practice to step up surveillance of foreign governments after an election and that after Trump’s surprise victory Nov. 8 this ramped up intelligence gathering provided more opportunities for incidental collection of Trump associates, as the transition team reached out to foreign governments to prepare for the new administration.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Donald Trump, national security council, National Security Council staff, President Barack Obama, Russian election interference, Susan Rice, White House








Every week the Russia story crumbles a bit more. Whether it is the loss of credibility of Crowdstrike’s hacking report, or the revelation by WikiLeaks that the CIA can make a cyber attack look like it came from wherever they want, the leftist media can’t catch a break. The FBI and NSA have both testified that there is no evidence that there was any hacking of actual voting, and the WikiLeaks allegations throw doubt on Russia’s involvement in hacking the DNC or Podesta emails. Even if they did, the media and the Democrats still have yet to convince anyone that the emails are the reason that voters chose Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Despite this, the media zealously chase after every angle of the story, mostly using “anonymous sources” and “individuals familiar with the investigation.”Well, they chase almost every angle on the Russia story — except for the very real connections between the Clinton campaign and Russia.The media keep the Russia story at the presidential level, failing to provide any sort of context for Trump’s win. The Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the federal and state level during Obama’s presidency, including 9 Senate seats, 62 House seats, 12 governorships, and a startling 958 state legislative seats. Did the Russians have a hand in all of those elections? Or are those election results clear signals of America’s shift away from Obama and Clinton, who promised to be a third Obama term?In the business world, feverishly pouring resources and time into a bad product in the hopes of validating past investments is called the sunk cost fallacy. Is that what is motivating the mainstream media to keep churning out their Russian “election hacking” coverage? Or is there another reason? Perhaps they are so masochistic as to enjoy President Trump sticking his thumb in their eye via Twitter:It is the same Fake News Media that said there is "no path to victory for Trump" that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017While they continue to desperately push stories about Russia, the mainstream media remain practically silent on the story they should be focusing on — the surveillance of Donald Trump and his campaign staff by the Obama administration. Unless the media want to portray Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) as a paranoid schizophrenic (Breitbart News wouldn’t put it past them), we now have strong indications that President Obama and his staff surveilled Trump and staff. This may or may not have been illegal, but certainly was cheating by any definition.The revelations about this spying are coming fast and thick. On Thursday, Kimberly Strassel outlined some of the key allegations in The Wall Street Journal:First, there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials. Second, the information these documents contained was not related to Russia. Third, while many reports did “mask” identities (referring, for instance, to “U.S. Person 1 or 2”) they were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed. Fourth, in at least one instance, a Trump official other than Mr. Flynn was outright unmasked. Finally, these documents were circulated at the highest levels of government.More news is already breaking on on the unmasking front — Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, has been reported as the official who requested the unmasking. This followed a Fox News report that a “very senior” official had made the requests. The headlines about Rice began following a post by Mike Cernovich naming her, along with broadcasts by him on Periscope, Twitter’s video streaming application.The media’s response to this story was immediate. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the response we’d hope for — a hard-hitting investigation into why Americans were under surveillance completely unrelated to questions about Russian connections. Instead, the media have been attacking Nunes with everything they’ve got.MSNBC host Joe Scarborough tweeted, “If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman.” He later said on his program “It is so obvious that this guy is getting bullied by the White House.” Will he next say Congress needs millions for anti-bully training?CNN’s Jake Tapper joined the party with a contentious interview of Nunes, including the stunning phrase: “Some question your impartiality.” For anyone associated with CNN to say that with a straight face is quite astonishing. As a thought experiment, what if we replaced Woodward and Bernstein with Tapper and Scarborough? Would Watergate have played out differently? I expect most of their energies would have been spent unmasking Deep Throat for his audacity in finding and sharing the truth, not to mention the patriarchal sexism of his code name!The rest of the media has been following suit. From parroting Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) saying that Nunes acted inappropriately, to the general Democrat talking points that Nunes must step down as Intel Chair, the mainstream media would have us believe that ABC News breathlessly reporting that Nunes refuses to step down from the committee is journalism at its finest.We know that “Nunes must step down” holds as much weight as the Russia story does, so Breitbart News along with our compatriots outside of the mainstream media bubble will continue to follow the Trump surveillance story with accurate reporting and insightful analysis. President Trump will continue to run circles around the biased media as he did this weekend, dominating headlines by lambasting NBC’s “Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd.”You may be left wondering, “What will the mainstream media do?” They will certainly continue pounding the rapidly fading Russia-Trump story and do their best to avoid the surveillance of Trump story. They will also continue bemoaning their loss of paying customers.A Gallup poll in September of 2016 found that 68 percent of Americans distrust the media. How would that number look today? Following months of uninterrupted media coverage of unproven Russian meddling, media distrust will likely be higher today than six months ago. In fact, the numbers are probably so bad that the mainstream media will have no choice but to claim Russia hacked the poll.Colin Madine is a contributor and editor at Breitbart News and can be reached at cmadine@breitbart.com Big Government, Devin Nunes, Russia, Russian hacking, Trump








According to Lake, Rice did not respond to an email seeking comment on the story.The breaking news helps confirm some of President Trump’s accusations that senior Obama officials were involved in disseminating classified information about his transition team to the media, fueling new details about the congressional investigations into Russia’s meddling in the election.On Monday, Fox News senior correspondent Adam Housley said that the “unprecedented” unmasking took place at the direction of “very high-up” officials.“A lot of these men and women in the intelligence communities did not want to speak about what’s going on because they were concerned about those methods being known,” Housley reported. “But now, they figure they might as well at least clarify things since Nunes has been leaked to by someone they don’t know or at least they tell me they don’t know.”Susan Rice has not denied the allegations, saying only, “I know nothing about this” when asked about the reports last month on PBS.Big Government, Donald Trump, Eli Lake, Susan Rice








Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” Fox News senior correspondent Adam Housley laid out his reporting on allegations that the then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and associates close to Trump were surveilled and that their names were unmasked at the behest of those in the Obama administration.According to Housley, it was done at the direction of those “very high up” and was done so for “a significant amount of time,” which he described as “unprecedented” and “blockbuster.”Transcript as follows:We don’t know who spoke to Devin Nunes. We know it’s not someone at the White House. We don’t know who spoke to the White House about this other than what Nunes has said in front of press conferences. The sources we are talking to are separate from both of those entities. They don’t really have a horse in this game. They are frustrated with the way they say the agencies are being politicized more than they have seen before in their careers. And one reason they are speaking out is because of that. The second reason is because Nunes came out in front of the cameras and has his finger on it, they say and want to make sure it is done correctly.What we’ve learned is this — from multiple sources is that it’s all about intelligence-gathering methods. The fact is, a lot of these men and women in the intelligence communities did not want to speak about what’s going on because they were concerned about those methods being known. But now they figure they might as well at least clarify things since Nunes has been leaked to by someone they don’t know or at least they tell me they don’t know. We know that there was this — there was surveillance of Trump and people close to Donald Trump including some supporters for up to a year before inauguration. That information was disseminated we’re told through NSA channels. It’s unprecedented the way this was done. The mention of U.S. citizens is supposed to be masked. That means basically taken out of the report.So for example, if I call somebody in Bulgaria, and that’s picked up somehow by our agencies and there’s nothing there involving national security, there’s nothing there involving a crime, that report would come out and it would say “American number one” or my name would not be there. What I’m told now is that when these reports came out, names were there and that is unprecedented. Basically, they say the information that’s unmasking, these names of Americans who had done nothing wrong was disseminated to all of NSC, some at DoD, Clapper, Brennan —  basically the people at the top.They also say I’m told Rice knew about this possibly as well. Now, I know there are some reports out there that she was the one who ordered this. We do not know who reported this because we have not spoken to Devin Nunes about it. He has not at least told us these things. So, we don’t know what papers he saw. Our sources don’t know what papers he saw. They just tell us about the information about unmasking names from Donald Trump and his team and his family was disseminated to a very select few at the top and was done so for a significant amount of time. And that is blockbuster, guys. As far as we know hasn’t been done at least in modern times when it comes to this type of thing. Also, as we look down at some of my notes here going through this, that there were also additional unmasking as well and, again, as far as we can tell, none of this had anything to do with national security.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBreitbart TV, adam housley, Fox & Friends, Fox News Channel, wiretapping








“People make fun of this beard — they think I look like a vagrant. I’ll tell you something, I have cut my shaving time to zero,” the former Late Night show host told TMZ in an impromptu interview in New York City.Of his Late Show successor Stephen Colbert — whose ratings have soared in recent months as his show has taken an increasingly hostile tone toward President Donald Trump — Letterman said “he’s a gifted young entertainer.”Letterman added that “it would kill” him to have to host his old show.“Everyday, day after day after day, no. I couldn’t keep up,” he said.While Letterman may be enjoying retirement, he hasn’t let his absence from late night stop him from bashing President Donald Trump.The former CBS star’s last show aired two months before Trump announced his presidential bid. Letterman told New York magazine last month that the president is “insulting to America.”“How do you know if Donald Trump is lying? His lips are moving. Thank you!” Letterman said. “But in addition to every other thing that’s wrong with the Trump, he’s ignorant in a way that’s insulting to the office, insulting to America, insulting to human rights, insulting to civil rights, insulting to John Lewis. Trump saying that broke my heart.” This article was updated to reflect that Late Show airs on CBS. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudsonBig Hollywood, beard, David Letterman, Late Show, retirement, Shaving, TMZ








In an appearance Monday on Good Morning America to promote the new book, titled Nevertheless, the 30 Rock alum and newly minted Saturday Night Live star told host George Stephanopoulos that a 2007 voicemail to his daughter Ireland — subsequently leaked to the media — caused a “permanent break” in their relationship.“It’s thrown in your face every day,” Baldwin said of the audiotape that made headlines nearly ten years ago. The voicemail caught Baldwin calling his then-11-year-old daughter a “rude, thoughtless little pig.”“There are people who admonish me, or attack me, and use that as a constant spearhead to do that,” the actor  said. “It’s a scab that never heals because it’s been picked at all the time by so many people. I think my daughter, that’s hurt her in a permanent way.”WATCH: @AlecBaldwin confronts his past, playing Donald Trump and more with @GStephanopoulos: https://t.co/30psHO19HD pic.twitter.com/2qZzKeWtne— Good Morning America (@GMA) April 3, 2017It seems, however, that the Boss Baby star and his daughter have put the incident behind them.In 2015, they posed in a photo together seemingly making light of the voicemail incident.

For me it was like, ‘OK, whatever.’ I called him back I was like, ‘Sorry, Dad, I didn’t have my phone.’ That was it.”Baldwin has been busy playing President Donald Trump during the 42nd and 43rd seasons of Saturday Night Live.

“My dad was a refugee when he first came to America, so it’s actually very close to home for my sister and brother and me,” the 20-year-old model — who has posed for campaigns for Fendi, Dior, DKNY and other fashion brands — told Porter magazine for its summer issue, according to preview excerpts in the Daily Mail.“He was always religious, and he always prayed with us,” Hadid said of her father, Mohamed Hadid, a real estate developer who was born in Palestine and reportedly lived in Syria and Lebanon before immigrating to America. “I am proud to be a Muslim.”Hadid and her older sister Gigi, 21, have quickly become some of the most sought-after models in fashion.The two have even worked together on some shoots, including for Moschino’s Spring 2017 campaign.‘People think we’re the same and that we’ve been working just as long, but I’m two years behind her,” Hadid told Porter of her relationship with her sister. “I still have a long time to catch up!”The supermodel sisters have also become fierce critics of President Trump’s proposed immigration policies.In January, the Hadids were photographed participating in a New York City rally to protest Trump’s proposal to temporarily halt immigration from a number of terror-prone countries.In November, Gigi Hadid came under fire on social media for performing what some critics called a “disrespectful” impression of First Lady Melania Trump during the American Music Awards.The model later apologized, saying the impression had been done “in good humor and with no bad intent.”Porter‘s summer issue is due out April 7. Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid, Mohamed Hadid, Porter








Speaking at the Marvel retailer summit this week, David Gabriel, Marvel’s vice president of sales, said the company had heard that people “didn’t want” any more diverse characters.“They didn’t want female characters out there,” Gabriel told industry outlet ICv2. “That’s what we heard, whether we believe that or not.”“I don’t know that that’s really true, but that’s what we saw in sales,” he added. “Any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up,” he continued.Gabriel’s comments follow Marvel’s recent attempts to create ‘diverse’ characters, such as a female Thor, a female Iron Man, a mixed race Spiderman, a Muslim teenage girl named Kamala Khanas as the current Ms. Marvel, as well as the appearance of a villain based on Donald Trump.The executive’s comments reportedly caused a stir online, with some Marvel fans maintaining that it is not the diverse characters that bother them, but the constantly updating and expanding universes and, consequently, the resulting confusing storylines.I love how Marvel thinks people are tired of "diversity". NO I AM TIRED OF WATCHING UNCLE BEN DIE 373929463 TIMES.— Alisha Rai (@AlishaRai) April 1, 2017However, Gabriel later clarified his position, claiming the company remained “proud and excited to keep introducing unique characters that reflect new voices and new experiences into the Marvel universe and pair them with our iconic heroes.”“We have also been hearing from stores that welcome and champion our new characters and titles and want more! So we’re getting both sides of the story and the only upcoming change we’re making is to ensure we don’t lose focus [on] our core heroes,” he added. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.comBig Hollywood, David Gabriel, diversity, marvel, Marvel Comics

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the “ripped from the headlines”-styled episode will be titled “The Newsroom,” with actors Christopher McDonald, Bonnie Somerville and Mark Moses set for key roles.The episode — set to air April 26 — follows a female news anchor who accuses her network boss of rape. The episode synopsis describes series stars, Mariska Hargitay and Raúl Esparza, investigating the “on-air disclosure of rape” against the TV network boss:“Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Barba (Raúl Esparza) ask witnesses to put their jobs on the line after a news anchor (Somerville) makes an on-air disclosure of rape against her boss,” the synopsis reads.The story comes on the heels of over a year of accusations and lawsuits aimed at Fox News chief Ailes by several on-air talents.This week, another Fox employee accused Ailes of sexual harassment.Nine months after Ailes was ousted as network chief, Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky filed a lawsuit in New York claiming that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances.The NBC show, which debuted in 1999 and is now in its 17th season, focuses on the investigations of the “special victims unit” of the New York Police Department and usually centers around a sexual crime. It has specialized in airing episodes on topics in the news.The show can often go over the top with its references to current events. Most recently, NBC announced that it would not air a politically-charged episode that featured a character based on then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The episode was originally set to air last October but was pulled.The unaired episode, which was completed before being shelved, depicts a candidate (Gary Cole) who is hit with multiple accusations of sexual assault in the middle of his presidential campaign.In 2013, the show was also criticized for casting troubled boxer Mike Tyson as a victim of sexual abuse.The recent Law & Order: SVU episode is far from the first project to use the Ailes accusations as fodder for entertainment. Just last year, Annapurna Pictures announced that the former Fox News chief will be the subject of a new film from Oscar-winning The Big Short screenwriter Charles Randolph. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Big Hollywood, Christopher McDonald, Law & Order: SVU, Law and Order: SVU, Mariska Hargitay, Mike Tyson, NBC, Roger Ailes








L.A. Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon on Monday rejected a motion filed by Polanski that would have allowed the director to return to the U.S. without fear of serving additional jail time in connection with his 1977 conviction for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles.“Mr. Polanski, through counsel, has filed the current motions which are similar to previously filed motions, and are based upon the same factual and legal arguments previously presented to the court and denied by other judges, and the Court of Appeal,” Gordon wrote in his 13-page order Monday. “No sufficient or compelling basis for reconsideration of these issues by the undersigned has been presented.”The Oscar-winning director spent 42 days in prison in 1977 and was released on bail before his trial.He fled to Europe the following year after he reportedly became afraid the judge would reverse his plea deal and sentence him to 50 years in prison.Polanski’s attorney, Harland Braun, had requested last month that the judge recognize and honor the director’s initial plea agreement.However, Gordon wrote that Braun “has not presented sufficient credible, admissible evidence or legal arguments to warrant the relief requested.”“Defendant, through counsel, filed the current motions are similar to previously filed motions, and are based upon the same factual and legal arguments previously presented to the court and denied by other judges, along with the Court of Appeal,” Gordon wrote. “There is no sufficient or compelling basis for reconsideration of these issues.”Braun accused the judge of ignoring key evidence he says prove corruption in his client’s case.“The most important issue in this case was the fact that there are secret emails between the judges, which undermined the integrity of the judicial proceeding in this case,” Braun told Deadline. “Judge Gordon’s decision does not even discus these emails because in discussing them in it reveals improper discussion among the judges.”“Roman Polanski has accepted moral and legal responsibility for his misconduct,” the the attorney added. “There does not seem to be one judge in Los Angeles Country who will discuss or reveal the judicial misconduct in this case.”U.S. officials asked Poland to extradite Polanski in January 2015. But Poland’s Supreme Court rejected the request and ruled that he had served his jail time under the original plea deal. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudsonBig Hollywood, extradition, Rape, roman polanski








According to AdWeek‘s TVNewser, which first broke the news, the last episode of Red Eye will air Friday, April 7 at 3 a.m.The irreverent news program with the dead-of-night timeslot launched in 2007 with host Greg Gutfeld, who left the show in 2015.Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart played a pivotal role in Red Eye‘s inception. Breitbart was a frequent guest on the program, which also regularly featured Gutfeld’s “repulsive sidekick” Bill Schulz, “ombudsman” Andy Levy and Tom Shillue, who became permanent host of the show in 2015.In a 2012 segment honoring the late conservative icon, Gutfeld said that Red Eye “would not exist” without Breitbart’s involvement.“It was him who talked to Fox to get me a job,” Gutfeld explained shortly after Breitbart’s passing. “I was living in England, and he talked to people at Fox. I met with people at Fox, and the next thing you know it was Red Eye. And everybody here who’s sitting here… we never would have met if it wasn’t for Andrew Breitbart bringing us together, because that’s what Breitbart does.”
Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.comThe March 2, 2012 episode of Red Eye was dedicated to Breitbart, with the show airing clips of the late conservative icon’s most memorable appearances.In a column for Breitbart News following his departure, Gutfeld said Red Eye was successful because of a “beautiful deal made between its staff and its viewers.”“The Redeye gang would refuse to underestimate the viewer’s intelligence, and the viewers would forgive us for our incoherence,” Gutfeld explained. “We attracted people that we would drink with, given the chance. These were late night types – up in the lonely hours for different reasons. Some had graveyard shifts. Others were nursing moms. Many, I learned were sick – or in hospitals, desperate for a distraction.”According to TVNewser, current Red Eye hosts Tom Shillue and Andy Levy will remain with Fox News.A representative for Fox News Channel said the show’s 3 a.m. slot would be filled by repeats of Tucker Carlson Tonight. Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, andrew breitbart, Andy Levy, Fox News Channel, Greg Gutfeld, Red Eye, Tom Shillue








Filmmaker Matthew Aaron has made a movie filled with gay characters that is more about the internet than it is about gays, Entertainment Weekly reports. But, whatever the plot, in many ways the film revolves around the characters’ love for the Chicago Cubs.The film is a thoroughly Chicago film based completely in the Windy City, and features many of Chicago’s most famous landmarks, including the Cubs’ Wrigley Field.MLB licensing chief Robin Jaffe helped guide Aaron through the licensing requirements and approval process, and when all was said and done producers realized that “Landline” had become the first specifically gay-themed movie to gain MLB approval.“In my research, there’s never been a film that stars LGBTQ actors made with the association of the MLB, the NBA, the NFL, or the NHL,” Aaron told the magazine. “[But] it’s not a film about being gay. It’s about two husbands who are going through their marriage together — typical, normal problems that everyone has.”“We never thought we were going to get [licensing for] the Cubs, and we never thought we’d get [to shoot at] Wrigley Field. We were just hoping that my character would be able to wear a Cubs jersey here and there for a couple thousand dollars,” Aaron added. “Robin really wanted to support indie filmmaking, which they’ve never done before, and they wanted to support this film. To top it all off, they wanted to support a film with LGBTQ leads in it.”While the film prominently features the Cubs — and even has a cameo by famed Cubs player Ryne Sandberg — the movie isn’t specifically about baseball. The flick features Aaron’s character as he finds younger, more tech-savvy competitors beating him out of new opportunities at his place of employment. The film then follows the character’s subsequent decision to divorce himself from cell phones, technology, and the Internet. And as Aaron navigates through his decision to dump technology he deals with the fallout from friends, family and his gay husband.The film stars gay actor Matthew Aaron, and features comedic actor Tom Arnold (“Rosanne”), Jim O’Heir (“Parks and Recreation”), Nick Searcy (“Justified”), James Dumont (“Jurassic World”), Louis Lombardi (“The Sopranos”), Betsy Brandt (“Breaking Bad”), and famed Cubs player Ryne Sandberg.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Big Hollywood, Breitbart Sports, Chicago Cubs, MLB








The new show, created by Atamanuik, will premier on Thursday, April 27 and will reportedly run weekly if it becomes a ratings success.“When I was first approached about this show I thought it would be about me, but on further thought, this makes way more sense,” Comedy Central president Kent Alterman said. Comedy Central released a short video clip on Monday, which offers a glimpse of what audiences can expect from Atamanuik’s parody Trump. .@LateNightDonald makes a surprising announcement.

“I don’t believe that it is very productive for the Trump White House to attack Republicans, and I think that is reflected in how his job performance and personal popularity numbers have been on the decline since he did that,” said the congressman, who had just left a meeting hosted by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) with other members of the House Freedom Caucus about moving forward with reforms to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.The administration needs to take a different approach. It needs to be professionally done–focusing in public policy and legislation,” he said.Brooks also said he was uncomfortable discussing what happened at the meeting.“Donald Trump is a pretty good golfer,” he said. The congressman was referring to Sunday’s foursome at the Trump National Golf Club —Sterling, Virginia — when the president golfed with Paul, White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney, and one other.I had a great time today with @realDonaldTrump and believe we are getting closer to an agreement on health care!— Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) April 2, 2017The legislative vehicle Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) presented as the only way to repeal-and-replace Obamacare was the American Health Care Act, or Ryancare. The House Freedom Caucus was in talks with the White House when Ryan pulled the Ryancare bill from the House floor March 24, nearly 15 minutes before the beginning of a roll call vote that Ryan was sure to lose.A Capitol Hill source familiar with the House Freedom Caucus told Breitbart News that even after the cancelled vote, members of the HFC have continued discussions with the White House about fixing Obamacare, which Ryan and other members of the House Republican leadership describe as being in a “death spiral,” because of its unsustainable business model.“I am more than happy to consider any health care bill that will reduce the cost of insurance premiums to American citizens,” Brooks said.Not only does the Ryancare bill create conditions that will see premiums continue to go up; the bill also creates a new welfare entitlement through income tax credits for Americans with no tax liability.Big Government, Obamacare, American Health Care Act, Donald Trump, House Freedom Caucus, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, RyanCare, Sen.

The website ProPublica reported Monday that the documents governing the trust that holds Trump’s businesses were changed in February to instruct the trustee to make distributions to Trump when requested. “Trump can draw money from his more than 400 businesses, at any time, without disclosing it,” ProPublica explained.According to ProPublica, this shows “just how little separation there actually is” between the Trump businesses and the U.S. government.To anyone familiar with the blind trust agreements signed by government officials, however, this is nonsense. Almost every trust agreement signed by U.S. government officials authorizes distributions upon request of the official for whom the trust is established.The sample blind trust agreement distributed by the staff of the Senate Ethics Committee is the model document used by senators and their staffs for setting up trusts. It authorizes precisely the kind of requests for distributions that has ProPublica scandalized. Section 7 of the agreement reads:There shall be no direct or indirect communication between an interested party and the Trusteee with respect to the Trust unless–(A) It related to a request for a distribution from the Trust of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust or…Importantly, this is the only form of communication with the Trustee that doesn’t require written disclosure with the Ethics Committee. Just like Trump’s trust, the Senate model trust doesn’t require disclosure of requests for distributions.The Office of Government Ethics, an independent agency within the executive branch, uses very similar language in its model blind trust agreement.SEVENTH: There shall be no direct or indirect communication between an interested party or 21 any representative of an interested party and the Trustee with respect to the Trust unless the 22 communication is in writing and has the prior written approval of the Director, U.S. Office of 23 Government Ethics, and unless it relates only –(A) To a request for a distribution of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust…There’s a very good reason why both agreements allow government officials to request distributions from their trusts without requiring any prior disclosure: that’s what the law says. The requirements for a blind trust for government officials are set out in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The law bars most communications between government officials and their trustees but it explicitly allows for requests for distributions.…except for communications which solely consist of requests for distributions of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust, there shall be no direct or indirect communication between the trustee and an interested party with respect to the trust unless such communication is in writing and unless it relates only [to certain permitted topics].In other words, the authorization of undisclosed requests from distributions in Trump’s trust agreement is fully in keeping with the law and the government’s standard agreements. The small change revealed by ProPublica brought Trump’s trust into further conformity with the trusts used by other government officials and U.S. senators.This is just another Gold Easter Egg: a story that falsely depicts something as a scandal because Trump does it when it is, in fact, totally normal.Big Government, Economics, blind trusts, Donald Trump, Ethics








Calling itself the Moscow Project, the CAP’s latest incarnation says its aim is “uncovering the truth about Trump and Russia.”The Moscow Project focuses heavily on the controversial, largely discredited 35-page dossier on Trump compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans to investigate Trump.The dossier contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed.The CAP Moscow Project’s website, which features an entire section titled “Dossier,” asks users to create an account and help to annotate and corroborate the Steele dossier.“Using the Genius tool on this webpage, you can create an account, highlight a portion of the dossier’s text, and add a comment that includes corroborating evidence.”The main page of the Project’s website utilizes the Russia allegations to fundraise:The Moscow Project is dedicated to investigating the extent, nature, and purpose of Trump’s ties to the Kremlin—but we need your help. By scouring the internet to investigate allegations, donating to fund our research, or sharing our findings on Twitter and Facebook, you can help uncover the truth about Trump and Russia.Despite a lack of evidence proving Russia interfered in the election, the website states matter-of-factly that “Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election was an unprecedented attack on American democracy and a deliberate attempt to place Donald Trump in the White House.”Without citing any proof, the site advocates a conspiracy theory that Trump is obedient to Russian President Vladimir Putin.The main page states:Given Trump’s obedience to Vladimir Putin and the deep ties between his advisers and the Kremlin, Russia’s actions are a significant and ongoing cause for concern.The president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund board of directors is Neera Tanden, who also serves as president of the CAP.Last month, Tanden exclaimed that Democrats are “literally just asking” for an investigation into Russian collusion allegations, claiming the issue has not been debated publicly among Congressional committee members.The CAP is financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations.CAP was founded by John Podesta, the former chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Podesta previously served as a counselor for President Obama’s White House and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton.The Steele dossier, meanwhile, served as a “road map” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign, the BBC reported last week.The FBI is not alone in relying on Steele. Earlier this month, Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on a House intelligence committee, cited Steele as a source repeatedly when he delivered his opening statements at a hearing where he laid out the case for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.The Washington Post reported that after being paid to compile opposition research on Trump by the billionaire’s opponents during the election, Steele “reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work, according to several people familiar with the arrangement.”Ultimately, the FBI did not pay Steele, the Post reported.The Post continued:Communications between the bureau and the former spy were interrupted as Steele’s now-famous dossier became the subject of news stories, congressional inquiries and presidential denials, according to the people familiar with the arrangement, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.In light of the Post report, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley earlier this month sent a letter requesting information on whether the FBI utilized Steele.In the letter, Grassley questioned the FBI’s intentions over the Steele report:The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for President in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI’s independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration’s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends.Citing current and former government officials, the New Yorker reported the dossier prompted skepticism among intelligence community members, with the publication quoting one as saying it was a “nutty” piece of evidence to submit to a U.S. president.Steele’s work has been questioned by former acting CIA director Morell, who currently works at the Hillary Clinton-tied Beacon Global Strategies LLC. Beacon was founded by Phillippe Reines, who served as Communications Adviser to Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. From 2009-2013, Reines also served in Clinton’s State Department as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications. Reines is the managing director of Beacon.NBC News reported on Morell’s questions about Steele’s credibility:Morell, who was in line to become CIA director if Clinton won, said he had seen no evidence that Trump associates cooperated with Russians. He also raised questions about the dossier written by a former British intelligence officer, which alleged a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. …Morell pointed out that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Meet the Press on March 5 that he had seen no evidence of a conspiracy when he left office January 20.“That’s a pretty strong statement by General Clapper,” Morell said.Regarding Steele’s dossier, Morell stated, “Unless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can’t judge the information — you just can’t.”Morell charged the dossier “doesn’t take you anywhere, I don’t think.”“I had two questions when I first read it. One was, How did Chris talk to these sources?

And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources and the intermediaries got the money from Chris. And that kind of worries me a little bit because if you’re paying somebody, particularly former FSB officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they’re going to call you up and say, “Hey, let’s have another meeting, I have more information for you,” because they want to get paid some more.I think you’ve got to take all that into consideration when you consider the dossier.Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Jason’s a busy man, and I’m grateful for both his friendship and his time. I have published columns before attesting to Jason’s extraordinary competence, high character, and humble demeanor — qualities which make him an ideal envoy for peace. Most of all, Jason is a Kiddush Hashem, sanctifying God’s name with his respectful words and actions.At our meeting, I gave Jason a copy of the Hebrew book I Called and None Listened, a collection of the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s speeches, essays, and letters about the Land of Israel and how peace in the Middle East might be achieved.Jason is tasked with a herculean objective: to bring tranquility to the world’s most troubled region. It is a project that will demand every talent in his arsenal, and then some.Joining him is our friend David Friedman as newly installed Ambassador to Israel.Here is a duo in the field of American diplomacy unequaled in their dedication to American values and Israel’s security. How will they go about implementing the President’s sincere desire for a peace deal? How will they find the correct balance of pressure and incentive that might bring an end to conflict?There were few issues about which the Lubavitcher Rebbe was more passionate than Israel. A man who spoke on Torah for hours at a time several times a week – always stoically and even-handedly – would suddenly transform when it came Israel. In his opposition to the belief that land concessions would bring peace, the Rebbe would alter his entire posture. He would become super-charged with passion, his voice would rise, his body language would surge. His language changed and he was prepared, for the first time, to voice strong challenges to those Israeli leaders compromising Israel’s security through territorial concessions.The Rebbe’s followers treated him as something of a prophet. I’m not here to debate that point, and those who do not adhere to Chabad ideology would surely beg to differ. But his predictions about land-for-peace deals surely proved prescient.In the late 1970’s, while Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin, and Anwar Sadat debated the return of Sinai in exchange for peace, the Rebbe predicted three outcomes for Israel forfeiting territory:1.         The world would develop an insatiable appetite for Jewish land. Rather than the return of Sinai satisfying the world’s lust for diminishing the Jewish state in size, the message to them would be that the Jews themselves had conceded to the claim that they were occupiers.2.         Jews would be attacked. The return of land would compromise Israel’s security and embolden its enemies to strike. Terrorism would increase rather than decrease.3.         Israel would be demonized. Rather than receiving a windfall of positive publicity and international goodwill for making peace, surrendering land would be used a PR baseball-bat to bludgeon Israel with deligitimization and international boycotts.All three of the Rebbe’s predictions were unfortunately proven true. After Israel surrendered Sinai, pressure immediately began to build for Israel to return the Golan Heights and Gaza. Judea and Samaria followed in the crosshairs. Most importantly, Jerusalem was identified as the supreme example of Israeli occupation, and the eternal capital of the Jewish people became a city to which the Jews had little claim and would serve as the capital of a Palestinian state.True, Israel has not had war with Egypt in nearly four decades. But it’s an extremely cold peace, similar to the cold war that Israel has with Syria, where there has similarly been no war for nearly four decades. Still, Egypt remains one of the world’s largest exporters of official state-sponsored antisemitism, and its population is deeply hostile to Jews and Israel, according to all polls. In addition, Sinai today has become a mini-state dominated by ISIS with little to no Egyptian control. Israel has recently even remodeled entire sections of its military to deal with potential threats from the Sinai Peninsula.True, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has changed course and has become a friend, perhaps even an ally  of Israel. In light of Egypt’s recent history — which has been an especially volatile period of rapid regime change — we can only hope that this continues and peace will prevail.But even if we applaud Israel’s courage to make peace with Egypt, why did it lead to Israel’s demonization? It began with Menachem Begin and Jimmy Carter. Scholars have pondered for decades as to how Begin, who had believed in the concept of “Greater Israel,” could have been the one to give away all of Sinai after Israel won it in a defensive war. This question is especially potent when you consider the fact that Begin probably didn’t need an agreement. Egypt had, thank G-d, been crushed by Israel in three consecutive wars, and its inferiority to the Jewish state in conventional warfare was unquestionable. Like Syria, to whom Israel did not cede an inch of land, Egypt would have, in all likelihood, never renewed open hostilities with Israel. The consensus, though, is that Begin believed that the most important issue for Israel’s security was a good relationship with the President of the United States. And it was in that belief that he gave in to all of Carter’s demands.How did that turn out? Carter became the single most hostile president to the Jewish state in American history. Begin’s capitulation left Carter not with admiration, but with contempt.The same dynamic played out during the first prime ministership of Benjamin Netanyahu, when he withdrew from Hebron, the second holiest city in all of Israel — and the resting place of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sara, Rebecca, and Leah. Netanyahu felt compelled to abide by the Oslo terms that had been negotiated by Yitzchak Rabin before him. But in doing so, he did nothing to change the continued contempt that President Clinton had always shown him. The very next year, President Clinton would send his own political consultants to work with the Israeli opposition that would ultimately defeat Netanyahu.I had the privilege of hosting the Prime Minister’s father, Benzion Netanyahu, at Oxford and Cambridge to talk about his noted book, Origins of the Spanish Inquisition. As fortune would have it, I was with him around the period that his son signed the Wye River Memorandum in Maryland.I will never forget the great scholar-warrior, who died in 2012, telling me that his son had been subjected to unbearable pressure, otherwise he would have never relinquished land vital to Israel.Of course, Israel’s reward for the Oslo Accords was a slew of suicide bombings in 1995 and then a full-scale intifada at the turn of the millennium that would claim over a thousand Jewish lives.Netanyahu’s government lost the subsequent election and was replaced by one under the helm of Ehud Barak. But when Netanyahu returned to power in 2009, he learned from his earlier mistakes, and has since never conceded land. He now continues as almost the longest serving prime minister in Israeli history.Donald Trump has thusfar proved a staunch friend and protector of Israel, and his defense of Israel at the UN through his emissary, Ambassador Nikki Haley, has no parallel. His warmth toward Prime Minister Netanyahu at their recent meeting was emphatically recounted by Netanyahu at AIPAC. Jason and David are American patriots and proud Jews. They know that three great principles of the Jewish faith are, first, that peace is life’s highest goal; second, that every human life is equal and of infinite value, Jew and Arab alike; third, God gave the Jewish people a tiny little sliver of land called Israel as an eternal birthright and homeland.The great events of Jewish Biblical history and most of its holy sites are in Judea and Samaria — which Jordan, in an effort to erase Jewish history, renamed the West Bank, just as the Romans, two thousand years earlier, had called Judea by a new name, “Palaestina.”We all want peace, but I would beg to remind those charged with achieving it of a lesson we have learned: surrendering land has not brought peace, but war.The Palestinians are my brothers and sisters, and Jason Greenblatt’s recent mission to Mahmoud Abbas — which  strongly encouraged economic development, self-sufficiency, and opportunity for the Palestinians of Judea and Samaria — was a noble and inspiring effort. The Palestinians deserve the same experience of human dignity and standard of living as do the people of Israel. It will not come, however, through their subjugation to the dictatorship of yet another Arab leader. Nor will it come through a land-for-peace framework that emboldens Israel’s enemies, compromises its security, and solidifies international enmity toward the Jewish state.Far better for the Trump administration to work on its inspired idea of an outside-in approach, resolving to try and create peace between the Arab Gulf states and Israel, which will then demonstrate to the Palestinians that their hopes of Israel’s isolation and diplomatic capitulation are a thing of the past.Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, “America’s Rabbi,” whom the Washington Post calls “the most famous Rabbi in America,” is the international bestselling author of 30 books, including his most recent, The Israel Warrior. Follow him on Twitter @RabbiShmuley.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, antisemitism, Benjamin Netanyahu, David Friedman, Intifada, Israel, Jason Greenblatt, Land for Peace, lubavitcher rebbe, menachem begin, Palestinians, shmuley








The expected report will aim to establish “premises and approach for calculating the cumulative cost of the occupation,” according to a resolution passed by ESCWA last December, mandating the research.The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is also said to be collaborating with ESCWA on the report. Although no publication date has been announced for the document, according to reports in Israeli media, it is expected to symbolically coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War in June.Read more here.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, anti-Israel activity, apartheid, Six-Day War, Slavery, State of Israel, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development








Imam Nalla Mohamed Abdul Jameel pleaded guilty to promoting enmity between different groups on religious grounds, and committing an act prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony, the Straits Times reports.“Nalla has paid the fine. He will be repatriated,” the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced in a statement late on Monday, according to Channel News Asia. He was handed a fine of Singaporean dollars 4,000 (USD 2,860).“Any religious leader from any religion who makes such statements will be held accountable for their actions,” the MHA statement continued.“Under Singapore law, we cannot, regardless of his religion, allow anyone to preach or act divisively and justify that by reference to a religious text,” it said.In February, a video was circulated online of the imam reportedly reciting a prayer in Arabic that said, “God help us against Jews and Christians”. The comment was made as part of a wide-ranging address.The incident came under police investigation after a video of the sermon was posted on Facebook. It sparked heated debate in Singapore’s conservative religious communities, prompting Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim to call for peace and unity in the Muslim community.The Economic Times reports Jameel’s lawyer Noor Marican was quoted as saying that the imam has accepted the punishment and is grateful that he was not sentenced to prison. Watch his announcement outside the court below:In a written apology submitted to the court, Jameel said that the chant he quoted was taken from a text he found at his village.“I had recited the additional supplication in Arabic, which was taken from an old text that originated from my village in India. It was not an extract from the Holy Koran,” he said. “As a resident here from a foreign land, I should have practised my faith in accordance with, and appropriate to the social norms and laws of this country. I fully admit that my said actions have no place wheresoever in this extremely multi-religious and multi-cultural society.”Nalla had been resident in Singapore since 2010 on a work permit. Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart TV, National Security, anti-Christian discrimination, anti-semitism, Arabic texts, Christianity, Imam, Islam, Singaporean law








Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) called on former National Security Advisor Susan Rice to be brought in front of Congress under subpoena and asked questions about allegations she was behind the unmasking of American identities in raw surveillance.Paul also said she should be asked about former President Barack Obama’s knowledge of these alleged activities.“For years, both progressives and libertarians have been complaining about these backdoor searches,” Paul said. “It’s not that we’re searching maybe one foreign leader and who they talk to; we search everything in the whole world. There were reports a couple of years ago that all of Italy’s phone calls were absorbed in a one month period of time. We were getting Merkel’s phone calls; we were getting everybody’s phone calls. But by rebound we are collecting millions of Americans phone calls. If you want to look at an American’s phone call or listen to it, you should have to have a warrant, the old fashioned way in a real court where both sides get represented.”“But a secret warrant by a secret court with a lower standard level because we’re afraid of terrorism is one thing for foreigners but both myself and a Progressive Ron Wyden have been warning about these back door searches for years and that they could be politicized,” he continued. “The facts will come out with Susan Rice. But I think she ought to be under subpoena. She should be asked did you talk to the president about it? Did President Obama know about this? So this is actually, eerily similar to what Trump accused them of which is eavesdropping on conversations for political reasons.”Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBreitbart TV, Morning Joe, MSNBC, Rand Paul, Susan Rice








“Susan Rice testimony now essential, but insufficient,” Coulter tweeted on Tuesday. “Must hear from Obama.”Susan Rice testimony now essential, but insufficient.  Must hear from Obama. #PutObamaUnderOath— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 4, 2017Coulter also suggested in another tweet that Michelle Obama may be able to shed some light on the White House surveillance activities during her husband’s tenure.“I don’t know if what she knows is privileged, but we need to hear from Michelle too,” Coulter tweeted.I don’t know if what she knows is privileged, but we need to hear from Michelle, too. #PutObamaUnderOath— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 4, 2017Rice allegedly ordered surveillance of Donald Trump’s campaign aides during the 2016 presidential election, and maintained spreadsheets of their telephone calls, the Daily Caller reported.The alleged spreadsheets add a new dimension to reports on Sunday and Monday by blogger Mike Cernovich and Eli Lake of Bloomberg News that Rice had asked for Trump aides’ names to be “unmasked” in intelligence reports.The alleged “unmasking” may have been legal, but may also have been part of an alleged political intelligence operation to disseminate reports on the Trump campaign widely throughout government with the aim of leaking them to the press.The surveillance and spreadsheet operation were allegedly “ordered one year before the 2016 presidential election.” According to a Fox News report on Monday, former White House aide Ben Rhodes was also involved.Big Government, Ann Coulter, Michelle Obama, Obama, surveillance, Susan Rice, Trump campaign aides

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is giving talking points to Joe Scarborough, which is a disservice to President Trump.








Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor under President Obama, seemed uncomfortable when asked if she would be willing to testify before Congress about her role in “unmasking” the Trump team from recorded surveillance.“Rand Paul is suggesting that you be subpoenaed to testify. Would you be willing to go to Capitol Hill?” MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell asked on Tuesday.Rice squirmed a little before responding.“You know, Andrea, let’s, let’s… see what comes. Umm, I’m not going, ahh, you know, sit here and prejudge, but what I will say is that the investigations that are underway as to the Russian involvement in our electoral process are very important and they’re very serious,” she said while stuttering a bit. “Every American ought to have an interest in those investigations going wherever the evidence indicates they should.”And as Infowars reported earlier, a body language expert said Rice was clearly being deceptive during a related PBS interview when she claimed to have no knowledge of the surveillance.While serving as National Security Advisor, Rice wanted to “unmask” the identities of Trump’s transition team officials whose conversations with foreign officials were “incidentally” collected by US intelligence, according to a bombshell report by citizen-journalist Mike Cernovich.“The White House Counsel’s office identified Rice as the person responsible for the unmasking after examining Rice’s document log requests,” he reported. “The reports Rice requested to see are kept under tightly-controlled conditions. Each person must log her name before being granted access to them.”Typically the names of American citizens in contact with targeted foreign officials are blacked out in intelligence reports if they’re not subject to the related surveillance warrants, not to mention other legal reasons based on Fourth Amendment protections.As such, the “unmasking” of Trump officials was politically-motivated, and former President Obama made policy changes throughout his presidency to turn “incidental collection” into de facto surveillance of U.S. citizens without valid warrants.“As his presidency drew to a close, Barack Obama’s top aides routinely reviewed intelligence reports gleaned from the National Security Agency’s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad, taking advantage of rules their boss relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats,” reported Circa. “Among those cleared to request and consume unmasked NSA-based intelligence reports about U.S. citizens were Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice, his CIA Director John Brennan and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch.”Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealKitDanielsTwitter: Follow @KitDaniels1776 MORE Videos: Resistance News








Bipartisan legislation introduced Tuesday would require law enforcement to obtain warrants before searching the digital devices of Americans at the border.The legislation, known as the “Protecting Data at the Border Act,” was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) while another version was presented in the House.“Americans’ Constitutional rights shouldn’t disappear at the border,” Wyden said. “By requiring a warrant to search Americans’ devices and prohibiting unreasonable delay, this bill makes sure that border agents are focused on criminals and terrorists instead of wasting their time thumbing through innocent Americans’ personal photos and other data.”Citing the 2004 Supreme Court case Riley v. California, which ruled that a warrant should be obtained to search an electronic device after an arrest, the legislation argues that exemptions should not be made for cell phones and the like.“As the Supreme Court unanimously recognized in 2014, innovation does not render the Fourth Amendment obsolete,” Paul said. “It still stands today as a shield between the American people and a government all too eager to invade their digital lives.”“Americans should not be asked to surrender their rights or privacy at the border, and our bill will put an end to the government’s intrusive practices.”The legislation also aims to protect Americans by requiring they be made aware of their rights by law enforcement prior to requests for important information such as device PINs and passwords.Currently, as noted by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, neither a warrant or individualized suspicion of wrongdoing is needed for “routine” searches.“Border agents argue that the border search exception applies to digital searches…” the EFF writes. “Given that digital devices like smartphones and laptops contain highly personal information and provide access to even more private information stored in the cloud, the border search exception should not apply.”Analysis of Department of Homeland Security data by NBC News last month found that border agents searched as many as 25,000 cell phones in 2016 – a substantial growth from 5,000 in 2015.








Lou Dobbs has declared that the imploding Democrat Party are “so far on the wrong side of history, it’s likely they won’t recover for years.”“The Democrat Party is out of excuses for what has become its ugly, nasty partisan thuggery,” Dobbs said during his broadcast on Monday night. “The new DNC chairman, Tom Perez, stands as an example, demonstrating that Democratic leaders now insist on going to the lowest common denominator in their politics and their tactics.”“How low, how ignorant, must Dems be to hurl expletives at the President of the United States?”Dobbs was referring to Perez’s unhinged tirade at a rally hosted by the New Jersey Working Families Alliance last week.“Donald Trump, you don’t stand for our values,” Perez railed. “You didn’t win this election.”“We have a bully in Washington in the White House.”Perez, who is Barack Obama’s former Secretary of Labor, also claimed that Republicans “don’t give a sh*t about people.”“Perez seems dedicated to helping Democrats gut their party,” Dobbs continued, noting that there are 23 Democrats and two allied Independents in the Senate up for re-election next year – 10 of whom are from states Donald Trump won in the presidential election.He also pointed out that the Democrats are investing all of their political capital and energy into relentlessly fighting the Trump agenda – including the tactical error of trying to filibuster his highly-respected Supreme Court nomination, Judge Neil Gorsuch, which could backfire tremendously if Republicans are forced to trigger the ‘nuclear option,’ which would likely carry over to future nominations.“The Dems are so far on the wrong side of history, it’s highly likely they won’t recover for years,” Dobbs concluded.A handful of Democrat officials have begun to realize the scope of their failures and diminishing influence, and have been warning their party mates to little or no avail.“At the present time… we have no strategy, and we have no plan,” admitted Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) recently. “I do think it is time for us to bring in younger leadership.”“In fact, if we don’t, I think it will spell the demise of the Democratic caucus – if we’re not already primitively in a state of smallness.”Cleaver’s cautionary statement came on the heels of a similar red flag thrown up by Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), shortly before he defeated by antiquated reigning minority leader, Nancy Pelosi.“I’m pulling the fire alarm, because the house is burning down, and we better get our act together or we’re going to cease being a national party,” Ryan said. “We’re going to be a regional party that fails to get into the majority, and fails to do things on behalf of those working class people that were the backbone of the Democratic Party for so long.”The Democrat Party, which once served as a home to John F. Kennedy and blue-collar, patriotic Americans, has morphed into the party of hate – hatred of American sovereignty, law and order, borders, traditionalism, free speech, and even white people.Dan Lyman: Facebook | Twitter








CNN anchor Don Lemon refused to cover reports Monday claiming former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice illegally unmasked and spread intel on the Trump transition team during the 2016 election.Focusing on Trump’s tweets charging that Obama had bugged Trump Tower, Lemon claimed there was “no evidence” of this, and accused Fox News of spreading the claim that Susan Rice illegally shared Trump team intel.“The president and the White House are still trying to make a lie true,” Lemon said.“Let us be very clear about this. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump team… was spied on illegally. There is no evidence that backs up the president’s original claim. And on this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise, nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion.”

Names of American citizens were unmasked in intel reports to protect the American people and may have included Trump transition team members, former National Security adviser Susan Rice claimed on MSNBC Tuesday.The former Obama administration official defended herself against allegations she inappropriately unmasked, then disseminated intel on the Trump team during and after the 2016 election.“The allegation is that somehow Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes. That’s absolutely false,” Rice told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Tuesday.“We only do it to protect the American people to do our jobs in the national security realm.”“There were occasions when I would receive a report in which a US person was referred to, name not provided, just ‘US person.’ And sometimes in that context in order to understand the importance of the report and assess its significance, it was necessary to find out, or request the information as to who that US official was,” she said.While denying Trump communications were unmasked for political purposes, Rice also insisted, “There’s no equivalence between so-called unmasking and leaking” – the difference being one is legal and the latter illegal.The former UN ambassador also claimed Obama admin officials had “grave concern” over Russia’s potential interference in the election and that interceptions may have increased during that time.“From August through the end of the administration we were hearing more and more about Russian interference in our electoral process. It was of grave concern to all of us in the national security team of the president and the president himself, so we took this issue very seriously. We thought it was crucial to defend the integrity of our election process and to be able to respond appropriately to what the Russians did to understand the full extent of their involvement.“So yes, there was a pace of reporting that accelerated as the IC got more and more information on that and shared it with us officials… I can say that from when this first came to light in intelligence channels to when the the administration ended, we got more and more information.”Rice also denied that she kept and shared a spreadsheet of Trump team names, as reported by The Daily Caller.“Absolutely false, no spreadsheet, nothing of the sort,” she said.








A Spanish gunship has illegally entered British waters off the coast of Gibraltar, which could lead to a war over the strategic Mediterranean territory.To put it into perspective, the UK waged war against Argentina in 1982 over a similar territorial dispute.Illegal incursion into #British #Gibraltar Territorial Waters by Spanish Navy patrol ship Infanta Cristina this afternoon. #BGTW pic.twitter.com/IkYadi8XNn— HM Govt of Gibraltar (@GibraltarGov) April 4, 2017  “Thirty-five years ago this week, another woman prime minister sent a task force half way across the world to defend the freedom of another small group of British people against another Spanish-speaking country,” media pundit Lord Howard said. “I’m absolutely certain that our current prime minister will show the same resolve in standing by the people of Gibraltar.”The gunship made the move only a day after Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis pushed Spain’s questionable claim to Gibraltar as the EU and the UK began Brexit negotiations.A potential war between two NATO countries reveals just how desperate European globalists are to save the crumbling EU, and the dispute itself is a throwback to the declining days of the Holy Roman Empire when feuding realms within the empire fought each other over territory.Despite Gibraltar being attached to the Iberian peninsula, Spain ceded the territory to the UK in 1713 as part of the Treaty of Utrecht meant to resolve the War of the Spanish Succession.In other words, the UK has maintained control over Gibraltar for over 300 years, which is of course longer than the existence of the United States as an independent nation.And Spain itself maintains control over territories attached to the African continent, namely Ceuta and Melilla.  Shouldn’t Morocco then demand those territories back from Spain?The local government in Gibraltar said the EU is acting like a “cuckolded husband” over Brexit.“Mr Tusk, who has been given to using the analogies of the divorce and divorce petition, is behaving like a cuckolded husband who is taking it out on the children,” Picardo told Reuters in an interview. “This is clear Spanish bullying.”“We are not going to be a [bargaining] chip and we are not going to be a victim of Brexit as we are not the culprits of Brexit: we voted to stay in the European Union so taking it out on us is to allow Spain to behave in the manner of the bully,” he added, while also pointing out that residents overwhelmingly want to remain under British rule as opposed to Spain.Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealKitDanielsTwitter: Follow @KitDaniels1776 MORE Videos: Resistance News








A retired general, who turned down President Donald Trump’s offer to be Secretary of Defense, suggested a preemptive strike on North Korea’s nuclear facilities “may be the only option left.”“A pre-emptive strike against launch facilities, underground nuclear sites, artillery and rocket response forces and regime leadership targets may be the only option left on the table,” retired four-star General Jack Keane told The Times on Tuesday. “We are rapidly and dangerously moving towards a military solution.”Keane, who currently serves as military analyst for Fox News, suggested that President Donald Trump’s future effort to pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping to level additional sanctions on North Korea will end in failure.“Our attempts to leverage China in the past have failed miserably,” he said. “Sanctions have not worked against North Korea and I doubt more sanctions will and I don’t believe sanctions against China will work any better.”K.T. McFarland, the deputy White House National Security Advisor, warned the likelihood of North Korea developing the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile was growing.“There is a real possibility that North Korea will be able to hit the U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile by the end of the first Trump term,” she said.President Donald Trump suggested he is ready to address North Korea’s continued development of nuclear weapons and aggressive rhetoric with, or without, the assistance of the Chinese government.“China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won’t. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don’t it won’t be good for anyone,” he told the Financial Times. “If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will.”Any preemptive strike on North Korea would lead to a highly destructive war, with Admiral Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, warning the war’s economic and geopolitical impacts would be felt throughout the world.








WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Treasury disappointed investors who filed litigation to stop the “Net Worth Sweep,” an Obama administration policy begun in August 2012 under which the U.S. Treasury has confiscated all Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earnings, amounting to some $260 billion, in a process that has removed from the two Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs) revenue that otherwise could have been used to recapitalize, while depriving investors from receiving dividends.An email obtained under a FOIA request provided to Infowars.com by a whistleblower in the continuing controversy over the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that makes clear a respected attorney in New York who had participated actively in the “Too Big to Fail” bank bailouts in 2008/2009, advised Congress as early as 2013 that continuing the Net Worth Sweep was “bad public policy.”“The ‘dividend sweep’ amendments have been challenged in court as either an unconstitutional taking of the property rights of the junior preferred and common stock holders or a breach of FHFA’s fiduciary duties to such stock holders as conservator of Fannie and Freddie,” noted Randall D. Guynn, an attorney widely recognized as one of the nation’s leading bank regulatory authorities, in an email dated Nov. 16, 2013.Guynn made clear he was authoring the email from the position as Head of the Financial Institutions Group at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, in New York City, to advise Congress that the “Net Worth Sweep” of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earnings, initiated by the Obama administration in August 2012, should be stopped.“While I have taken no side on these arguments, I believe the ‘dividend sweep’ amendments will undermine the confidence of investors in the rule of law (not only those in Fannie and Freddie, but also in the U.S. financial system more generally) and potentially have an adverse effect on financial stability in the United States, and are therefore bad public policy,” Guynn stressed.Through phone calls to parties referenced in the email, Infowars.com has confirmed that Guynn’s email dated Nov. 16, 2013 is authentic.Guynn addressed the memo to Michael Bright, who today is the director at the Milken Institute’s Center for Financial Markets, where he heads the housing program, and was in 2013 a staff assistant, responsible for advising Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker on banking policy, including Dodd-Frank Act implementation.Bright, after receiving Guynn’s email, sent an email dated Nov. 19, 2013, to Peter Brereton, Associate Director for Congressional Affairs at the Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA), and to Jeannie Schroeder, Congressional Affairs Office at FHFA.In that email, Bright instructed Brereton and Schroeder to ignore Guynn’s advice regarding the “‘half-baked’ wind-down” provisions of S.1217 introduced by Sen. Corker that would have continued the NWS despite provisions under Section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that suggest Fannie and Freddie should be allowed to keep their earnings as provided by the terms of the original “conservatorship” under which the Treasury had invested billion into Fannie and Freddie in return for preferred stock.In 2014, Sen. Corker joined with Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner to propose a Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act (S.1217) that would have closed Fannie and Freddie, replacing them with a privately capitalized system that would have empowered Wall Street and big banks to take over the mortgage finance in the United States.“We are only interested in his edits [Guynn’s edits] to make sure the transition is done on sound legal footing,” Bright instructed, affirming Sen. Corker’s only interests were to see Fannie and Freddie closed expeditiously, with mortgage finance turned over to Wall Street and big banks, as specified by the provisions of S.1217.Infowars.com has reported NWS revenues swept into the Treasury’s general fund were diverted to keep Obamacare from failing by providing the financial resources needed to pay the Obamacare low-income insurance subsidies that Congress had refused to allocate funds to pay.Infowars.com has also warned that the plan to replace Fannie and Freddie, secretly endorsed by President Obama as revealed by leaked Obama administration Treasury Department documents, is a plan to replace home ownership as a key component of the American Dream, with a European model in which the standard transforms to replace middle class homeowners with “well-housed” middle-class renters.On March 29, 2017, Corker joined Warner and a small bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators in authoring a letter addressed to Mel Watt, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, arguing that ending the NSW on March 31, 2017, would be detrimental to U.S. housing policy.The letter insisted that allowing Freddie and Fannie to retain earnings to recapitalize would be counter to legislation Corker and Warner have advanced to close the GSEs, as part of a plan to “overhaul” the U.S. housing-finance system by turning over mortgage finance responsibilities to Wall Street and big banks.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer took the media to task Monday for not reporting extensively on the revelations that Obama administration national security advisor Susan Rice worked to unmask the identities of Trump campaign aides in communications obtained by ‘wiretapping’.“I’m somewhat surprised in terms of the level of interest that I’ve seen from the press corps, one set of developments versus another set of developments,” said Spicer during a press briefing.Sean Spicer calls out "lack of interest" in Susan Rice report from the mainstream media pic.twitter.com/Ww3C3M4xgm— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 4, 2017  “More from a media standpoint I’m somewhat intrigued by the lack of interest that we’ve seen in some of these public revelations and reporting that has gone in that direction.”Spicer added.For weeks the media has been asking for proof from the White House to back up claims by President Trump that the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign’s communications.Now that evidence has been forthcoming, the press has stayed relatively quiet.Even MSNBC host Joe Scarborough chimed in Monday, noting that the story should have been front page news, but was no where to be seen:“Why isn’t it in the newspaper of record here?” asked Scarborough. “We’ve got Bill O’Reilly on the front page but we don’t have NSC, and Susan Rice?”There was more lack of interest over at CNN, unsurprisingly, where it seems to have become the network’s line to suggest that the entire issue over Susan Rice is ‘fake news’:Interesting: MSNBC and FOX going heavy on Susan Rice unmasking this morning.

A host of EU countries are set to demand Poland and Hungary accept their quota of migrants or they will face being booted out of the crumbling bloc.Both countries have ignored EU proposals to relocate 160,000 migrants and the rest of the bloc is set to take action to ensure they share the burden.Poland has ignored criticism from the European Commission over its handling of the migrant crisis and last week Beata Szydlo, the country’s prime minister, criticised EU plans for a “two-speed” Europe which would allow more powerful members to develop faster than their poorer neighbours.Meanwhile, Hungary has pushed back against the centralisation of powers in Brussels and eurosceptic leader Viktor Orban called for the country’s borders to be closed during the height of the 2015 migrant crisis.The two countries will now have to decide if they are willing to maintain their anti-migrant rhetoric if it puts their EU membership under threat, a diplomatic source told the Times.Read more








According to the media, President Trump can do no right, even when he’s giving his paycheck away.On Monday, Trump donated his entire first $78,333.32 paycheck to the National Park Service:While most politicians go into office to get rich, Trump is the first who could actually come out poorer.If he does come out richer, the media will say he gamed the system for personal profit. If he comes out poorer, they’ll attack him as a bad businessman, as they did after that earlier news came out.This is how The Hill covered his new donation:Environmental group slams Trump check to National Parks as a "publicity stunt" https://t.co/algfxFn83p pic.twitter.com/H9yKmgpCZq— The Hill (@thehill) April 4, 2017Even better, and my personal favorite, is this article from T. Becket Adams in the Washington Examiner, who is apparently a conservative.Don't cheer Trump's check to the National Park Service https://t.co/IIx1dVaJ9D by @BecketAdams pic.twitter.com/0uqts7sMfF— Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) April 4, 2017After noting Trump was legally obligated to take a salary and could therefore not legally fulfill his pledge to take a salary of only $1, Adams wrote:
President Trump doesn’t deserve praise for donating his first quarter salary to the National Park Service.…Trump pledged to take no White House salary. He then revised that promise and vowed to donate the money to charity. Spicer then announced this week that the president’s first taxpayer-funded paycheck would go to a taxpayer-funded agency.If Trump is going to renege on a promise to forgo a salary because he learned only recently that the job to which he applied bars him from refusing a paycheck, he could at least give the money directly back to the taxpayers. He could assist, say, one of the privately held veterans groups he talked about during the election.Funneling additional tax dollars into a federal agency is about as far off as possible from the spirit of pledging to take no White House salary at all, and it is amazing to see certain members of Trump’s base cheer it.Incredibly, that’s not even satire. This is what people in the Trump hating media actually believe.








A body language expert who analyzed a video of Susan Rice says Barack Obama’s former national security adviser was clearly lying when she denied having any knowledge of Trump transition members being spied on.During a March 22 appearance on PBS NewsHour, Rice claimed she “knew nothing” about Rep. Devin Nunes’s assertion that Trump transition members had their communications surveilled by the Obama administration.It has since been revealed that Rice repeatedly requested to unmask the identities of individuals who were the subject of “incidental” surveillance.According to a body language expert, Rice was clearly being deceptive when she claimed to have no knowledge of the surveillance.An analysis of Rice’s PBS appearance reveals her to engage in ‘double-blinking’ after making the denial while remaining very still in her neck movements, both flagrant signs of lying.Rice’s movements reveal her to be under “extreme stress” and “being extremely deceptive the entire time in this interview,” according to the expert.Numerous other examples of double-blinking are seen throughout the interview. According to studies, liars don’t blink during the lie, but are seen to engage in a “flurry” of blinks after telling it.According to the expert, the way Rice holds in her deep breath at the end of speaking is also another betrayal of the way she is putting herself under stress by lying.The expert concludes by saying that Rice would make a “really good study for things deceptive people do to hide themselves.”The mainstream media is currently engaged in damage control over the revelations surrounding Rice, with CNN desperate to play down the story in claiming that it is a distraction from their own hysterical obsession with Russia.SUBSCRIBE on YouTube: Follow on Twitter: Follow @PrisonPlanet Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.








GOP Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said he believes former National Security Advisor Susan Rice should testify before Congress on her request to unmask the names of Trump transition officials collected during routine intelligence-gathering operations.Paul argued the situation should not be downplayed, saying reforms need to be made to prevent individuals from being blackmailed on personal aspects of their lives through unmasking. He noted there was nothing stopping the former administration from looking through Trump officials and national security advisors’ conversations during the transition window.“If it is allowed, we shouldn’t be allowing it, but I don’t think should just discount how big a deal it is that Susan Rice was looking at these,” he told reporters Monday. “And she needs to be asked, ‘Did President Obama ask her to do this? Was this a directive from President Obama?  I think she should testify under oath on this.”Paul said he has long thought there are too many people with the ability to unmask individuals.Read more








Eleven were killed and 51 injured in a suspected suicide bomb blast inside a train in the St. Petersburg Metro, but you won’t see the expression of solidarity in European cities often displayed when other nations suffer similar heinous attacks.That fact was not lost on the curious few who took to Twitter to question if Paris, Berlin, London or other Western capitals would be granting the victims of Russia the same acknowledgement given to so many in the wake of several terrorist attacks.Many world leaders expressed their condolences with those impacted by the attack, including the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo.However, no landmark was decorated with Russia’s national colours Monday evening, although some creative types did try their best to rectify the snub.Well… Today Europe's shown her kind tolerant sympathetic face.

One potential bidder on President Donald Trump’s border wall with Mexico wanted to know if authorities would rush to help if workers came under “hostile attack.”Another asked if employees can carry firearms in states with strict gun control laws and if the government would indemnify them for using deadly force.With bids due Tuesday on the first design contracts, interested companies are preparing for the worst if they get the potentially lucrative job.A U.S. official with knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details haven’t been made public said four to 10 bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes.Read more








While Fox News is digging for the truth, CNN is waving everyone off.Fox published a bombshell story on Monday indicating former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice “unmasked” for political purposes the identity of Team Trump members communicating with foreign governments.The unmasked names, of people associated with Donald Trump, were then sent to all those at the National Security Council, some at the Defense Department, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-CIA Director John Brennan – essentially, the officials at the top, including former Rice deputy Ben Rhodes.The names were part of incidental electronic surveillance of candidate and President-elect Trump and people close to him, including family members, for up to a year before he took office. But CNN doesn’t see any story, and reporter Jim Sciutto went so far as to call it a “distraction” from what his network is really concerned about: Russia.Sciutto quoted a source “close” to Rice defending her, claiming that the allegations are “false.”“The idea that Ambassador Rice improperly sought the identities of Americans is false. There is nothing unusual about making these requests when serving as a senior national security official, whether Democrat or Republican,” Sciutto said, quoting the source.Sciutto contended such unmasking is not unusual.“This appears to be a story largely ginned up, partly as a distraction from this larger investigation,” he said.In other words, nothing to see here. Now let’s get back to Maxines Waters’ conspiracy theories about Trump and Russia!








Former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice ordered U.S. spy agencies to produce “detailed spreadsheets” of legal phone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides when he was running for president, according to former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova.“What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday.“The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls.”Other knowledgeable official sources with direct knowledge and who requested anonymity confirmed to TheDCNF diGenova’s description of surveillance reports Rice ordered one year before the 2016 presidential election.Read more

Alex Jones comes to you with breaking information on attempts to bring down President Trump by Democratic moles orchestrating chaos from within the White House and the truth about the Trump-Putin back channel.








Obama’s senior officials spied on their political appointments, broke the law to do it, lied in a cover up — but move along there’s nothing to see.Meanwhile, mainstream media applauds Susan Rice for using the powers of the surveillance state for political purposes.But IF she didn’t break the law, THAT would be an even bigger story and problem for America.

Customs and Border Protection agents apprehended fewer than 12,500 people who illegally entered the U.S. from Mexico in March, making it the lowest monthly number in 17 years, according to written testimony from Homeland Security Sec. John Kelly.The number of unaccompanied minors and family units who were taken into custody on land dropped sharply to 18,762 in February, the first full month of President Trump’s administration, which Kelly said was a sign of decreased traffic of illegal immigrants.A total 23,589 illegal immigrants were detained in February including ports of entry near the southern border.It’s unclear whether the 12,500 figure for March includes ports of entry numbers.Last month, Kelly said the “unprecedented” drop from 31,578 apprehensions in January reflects a reduced flow of illegal immigrants, and indicates Trump’s policies and executive actions on immigration – calling for a new border wall and follow-through of all immigration laws— are already causing some to stop before coming.Read More








On Monday, Bloomberg dropped an explosive allegation to add to the mounting evidence that Trump associates were victims of wrongful surveillance: National security adviser Susan Rice sought the identities of U.S. citizens whose names were masked in intel reports related to the Trump transition. The “smoking gun,” as Sen. Rand Paul called it, raises the question of how far up the chain of command the Trump surveillance went.If Rice ordered the so-called “unmasking” of U.S. citizens’ names, did President Obama know about it? Was the unmasking par-for-the-course-surveillance or was it an aberration — and perhaps unlawful?Smoking gun found!

The head of a general contractor in Fort Worth, Texas, says he has received several death threats since he publicly showed interest in bidding to work on President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall.For Michael Evangelista-Ysasaga, chief executive of The Penna Group LLC, the angry response is just a taste of what’s to come for the companies that are eventually picked by Customs and Border Protection to build wall prototypes. His company understands it will draw the ire of immigration and environmental activists if selected, he says, but the risks of working on the wall are worth the end result.“We didn’t enter this lightly,” Evangelists-Ysasga told the Associated Press. “We looked at it and said we have to be a productive part of the solution.”As bids for the wall roll in by the March 4 deadline, interested companies are preparing for a violent backlash if they end up with the high-profile job. Some firms have asked the government if border patrol agents would come to their aid if they came under “hostile attack” or if employees can carry firearms in states with tight gun control restrictions, the AP reported.The Trump administration has made the border wall the linchpin of its border security and illegal immigration policies, but the project has garnered a diverse group of opponents. Immigrant advocacy groups, environmental activists, and many private landowners along the Rio Grande are opposed to the wall and are expected to protest at construction sites.Enrique Morones, executive director of the San Diego-based Border Angels, said his group plans to organize non-violent demonstrations against the wall.“There will be a lot of different activity — protests, prayer vigils — on both sides of the wall,” he told the AP. “We pray and hope that they’re peaceful.”U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced that it will pick multiple contractors to build wall prototypes by June. The agency said it will instruct the Border Patrol to respond to construction sites in the event of an emergency, but it will not provide armed security to the companies that work on the wall.








British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday she would raise “hard issues” with Saudi Arabia’s leaders as domestic critics urged her to pressure Riyadh over its war in Yemen and human rights record.May, who has launched a diplomatic drive to secure trade deals after launching divorce talks with the European Union, said she would stand up for both human rights and her country’s national interests in her talks in the Middle Eastern kingdom.Saudi Arabia is a major customer for British defense companies, an ally in countering terrorism and a wealthy oil-producing nation that May’s government hopes to win over after launching Brexit talks late last month.But Britain’s supply of aircraft, weapons and munitions to the Saudis has come under scrutiny because of Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition plays a major role in the two-year civil war that has killed more than 10,000 people, half of them civilians.Read more

For the first time since the financial crisis, more Americans view the economy favorably, according to a report from the Pew Research Center.Pew found that 58 percent of Americans say the current economic situation in the United States is good, compared with only 40 percent who say it’s bad. Last spring, 54 percent of Americans said the economy was in bad shape compared while 44 percent of Americans said it was in good shape.“This is the most positive assessment of U.S. economic conditions since 2007, and only the second time that half or more of those surveyed have given the economy a thumbs-up,” the report said. “The 14-percentage point rise in overall public opinion about the economy since last year is the largest one-year improvement in public sentiment about economic conditions in the history of the survey.”In spring of 2008, in the middle of the recession, only 20 percent of Americans said the current economic condition in the United States was good.Read more

Electric car maker Tesla, Inc. had a record quarter from January to March 2017, during which it both produced and delivered the highest number of vehicles for any quarter so far. In a Sunday update, the Elon Musk company said it “delivered just over 25,000 vehicles” during the first quarter of the year.The announcement also broke down the deliveries into about 13,450 Model S sedans and another 11,550 or so Model X SUVs. The statement added: “Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5 percent.”The number represents a significant 69 percent increase over the same quarter in 2016, and a more modest 12 percent increase from the October-December 2016 quarter. Tesla did not count in the first quarter deliveries of about 4,650 vehicles that were in transit to customers at the end of March; those vehicles will be added to the second quarter delivery count.Read more








Scientists at the University of Basel have shown that LSD reduces activity in the region of the brain related to the handling of negative emotions like fear.The results, published in the scientific journal Translational Psychiatry, could affect the treatment of mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety.Hallucinogens have many different effects on the psyche; among other things, they alter perception, thought, and temporal and emotional experience.After the Basel-based chemist Albert Hofmann discovered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the 1940s, there was a huge amount of interest in the substance, particularly in psychiatry.It was hoped, for example, that it could provide insights into the development of hallucinations, and studies were conducted on its effectiveness on illnesses such as depression or alcohol dependency.In the 1960s, LSD was declared illegal worldwide, and medical research on it came to a standstill.Read More








CNN is already claiming the whole Susan Rice scandal is a tempest in a teapot, and the Trump team is exaggerating it to distract the public from…something. Fill in the blank yourself. For example: Trump isn’t actually the president, he cheated his way into the Oval Office, while acting as a secret agent for his handler, Vladimir Putin, who in turn was operating on behalf of aliens from Jupiter.The Susan Rice scandal is out in the open. She, Obama’s national security advisor, led an effort to spy on legal phone calls the Trump team was making during the presidential campaign, in order to gain “intelligence on the enemy.”The Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) spoke with “Col. (Ret.) James Waurishuk, an NSC [National Security Council] veteran and former deputy director for intelligence at the U.S. Central Command.” Waurishuk said: “…many hands had to be involved throughout the Obama administration to launch such a political spying program…It’s unbelievable of [sic] the level and degree of the [Obama] administration to look for information on Donald Trump and his associates, his campaign team and his transition team. This is really, really serious stuff’.”“Michael Doran, former NSC [National Security Council] senior director, told The DCNF Monday that ‘somebody blew a hole in the wall between national security secrets and partisan politics’. This ‘was a stream of information that was supposed to be hermetically sealed from politics and the Obama administration found a way to blow a hole in that wall’, he said.”Yes, serious stuff. A felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Obama, of course, will have plausible deniability if the Susan Rice scandal blows up into a Watergate. He didn’t know. He didn’t order the spying. He was playing golf that day. Or any day.And if a Congressional investigation of Rice and her antics reaches a fever pitch, somebody can play the race card. That’s always an option.“If Rice were white, this never would have happened to her.”“The Trump people are all over her like white on Rice.”Meanwhile, CNN, in alternating segments, can say a) Rice and her people never spied on anybody, and b) everybody spies on everybody all the time, it’s not a big deal…and then some on-air goofball will add, “In fact, we here at CNN are spying—”And the TV screen will go blank, then display colored stripes, then come back and the goofball will be gone, and an anchor will say, “We had a technical problem for a moment.”But under no circumstances will CNN or MSNBC admit that the swaggering shoot-from-the-hip cowboy in the Oval Office was right when he lashed out and claimed the Obama administration was spying on him. Even if a few Obama people come out in the open and confess to the spying, those networks will insist Trump made a lucky guess, that’s all. It was all a coincidence.And anyway, he’s not the real president, he’s a spy ultimately working for aliens from Jupiter; and on Jupiter, everyone is a racist.And that will settle that.This article first appeared at NoMoreFakeNews.com.

Seeking the truth and exposing the scientifically engineered lies of the globalists and their ultimate goal of enslaving humanity.Alex Jones is internationally recognized by many as a trailblazer of new media and an icon of the burgeoning liberty movement.Starting at the tender age of 20, Jones launched an access television show which within a year led to him scoring a highly rated week night radio show in Austin, Texas.The Alex Jones Show is now syndicated on over 160 stations across the country and routinely breaks huge stories in addition to featuring some of the most insightful and news making guests from across the world.Jones is dedicated to libertarian and constitutionalist ideas, in addition to what he has coined "1776 worldwide" - promoting a true culture of liberty, transparency and freedom on a planetary scale to empower humanity, while vehemently opposing Agenda 21 and the globalist threat to national sovereignty.Jones believes that informing people about the true nature of power, we can foster a real debate about humanity's destiny and allow the species to evolve towards a more orderly singularity that has humans at the core of a system which is based around maintaining free will and integrity  - defying the transhumanist goal of Social Darwinism and scientific dictatorship.Amidst the mammoth ideological clash between techno-authoritarianism and free human movements across the globe, Jones is a bullhorn for true libertarian principles and the empowerment of humankind in the eternal battle against tyranny.Jones has hit the headlines on numerous occasions for his outspoken advocacy for freedom, notably in January 2013 when he took part in a televised debate with CNN's Piers Morgan on gun control which garnered global attention.A 2011 Rolling Stone article described Jones as "a giant in America's conspiracy subculture," with a subsequent in-depth profile adding that he made Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, "sound like tea-sipping NPR hosts on Zoloft."According to UT Professor Randolph Lewis, Jones is "one of the most important political media figures in the country" and "his circle of Texas libertarians is maybe the most important zone of resistance to surveillance culture right now.""Alex Jones is a model for people to create their own media," Michael Harrison, editor of the industry trade magazine Talkers, told Rolling Stone writer Alexander Zaitchik. "When the history is written of talk broadcasting's transition from the corporate model of the 20th century to the digital, independent model of the 21st century, he will be considered an early trailblazer."By establishing a team of news reporters who provide cutting edge analysis and on the ground high tech breaking coverage, Infowars.com continually dominates the news coverage while wearing our bias - the truth - openly and proudly on our sleeve.In the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, Jones passionately argues against foreign entanglements and wars for the sake of corporate and banking interests. Jones avoids the bogus political labels of "left and right" and instead focuses on what really matters — what's right and wrong. As a tenacious journalist, Jones has broken hundreds of national stories over the span of his career, a feat that led to Matt Drudge giving Infowars.com a much coveted spot on the permanent links section of his hugely influential and highly trafficked website, DrudgeReport.com.Jones' infiltration of the ultra-secretive Bohemian Grove compound in 2000 also caused shockwaves, with the occult cremation of care ritual being caught on camera for the first time.Alex's mainstay is his nationally syndicated news-talk show produced from his studio in Austin and broadcast on the Genesis Communication Network, based in Minnesota. The Alex Jones Show airs on over 160 AM, FM, and shortwave stations across the United States Monday through Friday from 11:00 a.m.—2:00 p.m. Central Standard Time. As well, Alex's show is the largest draw for the talk genre on Shoutcast and the Internet. Alex does a syndicated and nationally broadcast Sunday show on Emmis Communications' KLBJ 590 AM in Austin, Texas.Jones is recognized for his incisive and hard-hitting interviews with a wide range of guests. Prominent guests include Willie Nelson, Charlie Sheen, Joe Rogan, Russell Brand, Billy Corgan, Chuck Norris, Jesse Ventura, Ted Nugent, Lou Dobbs, Tommy Chong, Geraldo Rivera, Ed Asner, and others.Alex has interviewed hundreds of politicians, government officials, researchers, political activists, authors, economists, political analysts, scientists, and entertainers, including Rand Paul, Ron Paul, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Ralph Nader, Chuck Baldwin, George Galloway, Gore Vidal, Greg Palast, David Lynch, Joseph Stiglitz, Vigo Mortenson, Roddy Piper, Shooter Jennings, Public Enemy, Noam Chomsky, Pat Buchanan, Eva Orner, and even David Mayer de Rothschild, to name but a few.Alex's interview with actor Charlie Sheen, who disputed the official explanation of the attacks of September 11, 2001, received mainstream notice on CNN Showbiz Tonight, Fox News' Hannity & Colmes, and Jimmy Kimmel Live. Willie Nelson's questioning of 9/11 on Alex's radio show resulted in Fox News' Bill O'Reilly featuring the iconic musician and political activist on the "Pinheads & Patriots" segment of his O'Reilly Factor television show. Nelson also called for the impeachment of Bush on Alex's show."If you've never heard of Alex Jones, then you've been missing out on some of the most dynamic, hard-hitting radio on the planet," explains ZDNet. "This guy is a national treasure, a light breaking through the electronic Berlin Wall of the US media establishment," adds BBC investigative journalist Greg Palast.Documentary FilmsAlex Jones is a prolific filmmaker, producing on average two films per year since his first documentary, America: Destroyed By Design, was released in 1997. Alex's films primarily document the emergence of the New World Order, world totalitarian government, the steady erosion of the Constitution and national sovereignty in the United States, government corruption, corporate fascism, eugenics, martial law and the encroaching police state."Find out how the sovereignty of the United States is being subordinated to the globalist interests, through such examples as the Foundations at the Presidio and the Panama Canal. See United Nations and Chinese Interests are affecting our nation. Witness the United Nation's indoctrination of America's children and watch exclusive interviews with witnesses of the Oklahoma City Bombing."Documents how the U.S. Government grossly overstepped Constitutional boundaries, as well as the cover up that followed with the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas.There are over 85,000 Federal and regional governmental institutions: school districts, water and power authorities, country and city governments — and they own over 70 percent of the stock market. The video includes an interview with Joe Banister, former IRS Special Agent, exposing how the IRS is a collection agency for the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.Jones' "Dark Secrets: Inside the Bohemian Grove" documented the first ever hidden camera incursion into the Grove and the bizarre pagan ritual, the Cremation of Care, practiced by its members, all men, including both Presidents Bush, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Colin Powell, and Henry Kissinger to name but a few.Exposes the growing militarization of American law enforcement and the growing relationship between the military and the police.From children in public schools being trained to turn in their peers and parents to the National Guard and Army patrolling our country's highways, The Takeover reveals the most threatening developments of police state control in our age.Details the birth of a global police state, the history of government sponsored terrorism, the modern implementation of fear-based control, and the future plans of the New World Order.In two hours, Alex Jones reveals the Globalists' master plan for world domination. In this powerful expose, Jones explains why the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the populations into accepting tyranny.This film documents the nightmare rise of the Homeland Security dictatorship, Patriot Acts 1 and 2, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy and much more.Matrix of Evil contains footage from speeches and conversations with Alex Jones, Congressman Ron Paul, Colonel Craig Roberts, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney and Frank Morales.American Dictators is a 90+ minute expose chronicling the degeneration of America's political process. Alex Jones rips away layer after layer of the false left-right paradigm and finally reveals the 2004 election.From the frontlines of the Police State to the darkest sanctum of the secret society that controls it, Martial Law reveals the master plan of a group hell-bent on capturing America today — and tomorrow the world.Exposes the connections between the Bohemian Club and Skull and Bones and other occult secret societies. Jones explores the roots of the Grove and its links to occult networks dating back to ancient Egypt and Babylon.Throughout history, criminal elements inside governments have carried out terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them. TERRORSTORM reveals how, in the last hundred years, Western leaders have repeatedly murdered their own citizens while posing as their saviors.Jones chronicles the history of the global elite's bloody rise to power and reveals how they have funded dictators and financed the bloodiest wars—creating order out of chaos to pave the way for the first true world empire.Including interviews with Jesse Ventura, Rosie O'Donnell, George Carlin, Willie Nelson and Martin Sheen, this film is unlike anything you have ever seen. The only question after viewing it is: will you become part of the Truth Rising?In addition to producing the above films, Alex had a cameo role in Richard Linklater's Waking Life, a part that received a standing ovation at the Sundance Film Festival. He also appeared as the "street prophet" in Linklater's 2006 film, A Scanner Darkly, based on the novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick.

184 Views After the White House Counsel identified Susan Rice as the person responsible for the unmasking of Trump officials, it has been discovered she was only able to do so after President Obama change the unmasking rules.Susan Rice, who served as the National Security Adviser under President Obama, has been identified as the official who requested unmasking of incoming Trump officials, Cernovich Media can exclusively report.The White House Counsel’s office identified Rice as the person responsible for the unmasking after examining Rice’s document log requests. The reports Rice requested to see are kept under tightly-controlled conditions. Each person must log her name before being granted access to them.Upon learning of Rice’s actions, H. R. McMaster dispatched his close aide Derek Harvey to Capitol Hill to brief Chairman Nunes.“Unmasking” is the process of identifying individuals whose communications were caught in the dragnet of intelligence gathering. While conducting investigations into terrorism and other related crimes, intelligence analysts incidentally capture conversations about parties not subject to the search warrant. The identities of individuals who are not under investigation are kept confidential, for legal and moral reasons.Under President Obama, the unmasking rules were changed. Circa originally reported:As his presidency drew to a close, Barack Obama’s top aides routinely reviewed intelligence reports gleaned from the National Security Agency’s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad, taking advantage of rules their boss relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats, Circa has learned.Three people close to President Obama, including his “fall guy” for Benghazi (Susan Rice), had authorization to unmask.Among those cleared to request and consume unmasked NSA-based intelligence reports about U.S. citizens were Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice, his CIA Director John Brennan and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch. commentsBest free WordPress theme








Folks, on Monday President Trump urged all Americans to watch this “incredible reporting” by Fox News.The report suggest that Obama spied on Trump before election. Please help us SPREAD THIS!“SUCH AMAZING REPORTING ON UNMASKING AND THE CROOKED SCHEME AGAINST US BY @FOXANDFRIENDS,” TRUMP TWEETED,” SAYING THAT HE HAD BEEN “[S]PIED ON BEFORE NOMINATION.”
The intelligence official that was responsible for unmasking the Trump associates is “very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world.”“The main issue in this case, is not only the unmasking of these names of private citizens, but the spreading of these names for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security or an investigation into Russia’s interference in the U.S. election,” a source in congress told Fox News.Bombshell report over the weekend shows a 'very high up' Obama official unmasking Trump associates for political purposes, sources say pic.twitter.com/Rj6JEXbobb— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 3, 2017“Adam Housley did an incredible job with this information,” “Fox and Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade said Monday.“We heard germs of it, that it was beginning to take root during Friday’s show. But right after Friday’s show, we were able to get a perspective on basically what President Trump thought a month ago when he went out and tweeted on Saturday morning. Man, I guess on some level he saw some things that only somebody surveilling his administration would know.”  commentsBest free WordPress theme

68 Views History will remember the Obama years as a time of corruption, bad government, and deceit.During their final year in office, the Obama Administration spent a whopping $36.2 million in legal fees in order to deny Freedom of Information Act requests. This is a record, via The Washington Times.“Transparency for thee, not for me,” seems to have been Obama’s true motto.In total, Obama’s campaign of relentless censorship led to an impressive backlog of FOIA requests — over 200,000. Most were rejected.Even Obama’s lackeys had to admit almost 34-percent of all FOIA rejections were “improper under the law” (aka, illegal), via PBS.Despite the assertions made by our own Pravda, Obama’s time in the White House was far from “scandal-free.”Indeed, as more evidence piles up showing the outgoing Obama administration spied on the Trump team, it’s important to remember most of Obama’s scandals involved some form of political censorship or oppression.In 2013, the IRS targeted conservative organizations and placed them under excess scrutiny for illegitimate reasons. After giving investigators a complete runaround, the agency was forced to acknowledge the targeting of conservative groups in an effort to upset their tax exempt statuses, via Washington Times.Various news organizations claimed the Obama administration spied on them, possibly to achieve total control of media output. In 2013, Obama’s Department of Justice openly spied on the Associated Press by seizing phone records, via New York Times.As reported by The Angry Patriot, investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson believes Obama officials hacked her computer in order to stop her from accurately reporting the 2012 attack on CIA facilities in Benghazi.Finally, to address what could be the biggest scandal of all, Congress is moving closer to uncovering the means by which the Obama administration moved to weaponize false leaks and pursued wiretapping campaigns to illegally undermine the Trump campaign.If California Republican Devin Nunes is correct, the Obama administration deliberately targeted U.S. officials, military officers, and politicians, all in a failed attempt to find legal justification for preventing President Trump from reaching office.The era of “Hope and Change” was nothing more than a banana republic, overseen by a paranoid autocrat. Obama’s love of censorship is symbolic of the Democrats and the left. In order to bring about their utopian paradise of big government multiculturalism, Obama’s delusional followers continuously resort to treasonous activity.It’s time to end the Obama nightmare for good. commentsBest free WordPress theme








On his show, conservative champion Rush Limbaugh chastised Michelle Obama for attacking Donald Trump about his ‘ locker room talk ‘ after she herself has hosted vulgar music stars and rappers whose song lyrics are more obscene than Trump has ever said.Limbaugh immediately called out the double standard.‘Men brag, and she is telling people that she doesn’t know men who brag. You know the people that have been to the White House?’ Rush said. (WARNING: Some of the language here and later in the story may be offensive to some readers.)‘How about some of the rappers that talk about their b****** and their hos have performed such lyrics in the White House? But she doesn’t know men who talk and sing about sexual assault. It’s all over hip-hop lyrics and has been for a while!‘So is assault on the police a feature of some hip-hop lyrics, and it’s been performed at the White House. But she doesn’t know men who talk that way. She doesn’t know decent guys who talk that way.’Limbaugh also brought up a ‘sermon’ by the Obamas’ former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright.‘Yeah, I guess Michelle Obama wasn’t there when the Rev. Wright was talking about Bill Clinton,’ Rush said ‘You remember what Rev. Wright said about Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky? … ‘And Bill and Monica Lewinsky was riding dirty. Yeah, chickens have come home to roost, baby.’ ‘Bill was riding dirty,’ and the population, the congregation went nuts.’And while Rush didn’t mention her, let’s not forget Michelle’s BFF, Beyoncé. Here are some of her lyrical exploits (WARNING AGAIN: graphic language):The first lady, meanwhile, calls her a role model.Both of the Obamas are professed Christians, which means (I assume) they are familiar with the Bible. I seem to recall something in the book of Matthew involving specks and logs in eyes.It’s hard to remember the precise wording, but perhaps Michelle can search for it before she sais anything against Trump’s words because she will only end up looking foolish herself.Be sure to share your thoughts in the comment section below to let us know what you think of this. commentsBest free WordPress theme

141 Views Joy Behar and her fellow liberals on The View have been attacking Donald Trump every day for months. On Monday, however, Behar took things too far when she questioned his mental state and called for him to be impeached.Newsbusters reported that the women were discussing Nikki Haley’s weekend appearance on ABC where she was grilled by Martha Raddatz about Trump and Russia. Liberal nitwit Whoopi Goldberg said she was “freaked out” by Trump staying out of the fray when it comes to Russia, and North Korea, adding, “Isn’t somebody supposed to be in charge?”That’s when Behar chimed in to give her own ignorant opinion about Trump’s past statements on nuclear warfare:“The thing about Trump is, the things he has said seriously about nuclear weapons is quite frightening,” Behar said. “I’ll give you a couple. To Chris Matthews, he asked, ‘Why do we make them, he said, if we wouldn’t use them?’  Ok. The possibility of nuclear war between Japan and North Korea. ‘It would be a terrible thing. If they do, they do.’ Good luck. Enjoy yourselves, folks. He said he was open to nuking Europe because ‘it’s a big place.’”Behar then went into a truly deranged rant, calling him “nuts” and saying he needs to be “taken out of office.” She even had the nerve to compare him to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.“Why doesn’t everybody face it? He needs to be taken out of office. He needs to be impeached– [ cheers and applause ] He is a menace,” she barked. “You say Kim Jong Yum-yum is crazy? So is he. So is he. Get real. Come on. He is nuts and we’re in the middle of it!”Viewers immediately took to Twitter to let Behar know that she’d taken things WAY too far:@TheView Joy Behar is the one who is nuts, and should be fired. She is the main reason I don't watch the View.— Lynn (@lefbroom) April 3, 2017 commentsBest free WordPress theme








The Secret Service are constantly on high alert 24/7 protecting President Trump and his family since the liberal lunatics are dedicated to take him down. They have just uncovered a new threat outside the White House grounds, just 24 hours before President Trump was set to arrive.Multiple fence jumpers, suspicious packages, and other alarming finds on the White House grounds were just the start of a bigger picture that’s unfolding around the country to attack Trump. His Mar-A-Lago golf resort in Florida has been a target of violence as it has become his “weekend White House,” but now no property will be left unscathed after what was just found at the Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Virginia.Police are investigating damage done over the weekend to a course at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia.Vandals dug holes in the 13th fairway of the club’s Championship Course, spray-painted parts of the course and poured a chemical, believed to be bleach, on the grass, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies found empty containers of bleach at the scene, the sheriff’s office said.The word “resist” was spray-painted on the fairway and symbols associated with anarchists appeared to have been spray-painted and dug into the course. Rocks on the fairway were spray-painted red and orange, according to the sheriff’s office.An investigation is under way.The president has visited Trump National twice in the last two weeks. On March 25, The Hill reported Trump held several meetings at the course clubhouse. commentsBest free WordPress theme








In a pervasive progressive culture that usually seeks to mock, ridicule, threaten and demean traditional lawmakers into compliance, it’s inspiriting to witness a tough elected official standing up for America.And Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne is no doubt one tough lady who will be joining the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to work under Secretary Ben Carson.For those perhaps not familiar with Van Duyne, she’s the mayor that touched off a firestorm within the mainstream media, when she challenged a group of hard-line Imams who tried to bully her into accepting a form of “Sharia Law” into Texas.The feisty mayor vowed that the Islamic tribunal being set up in the Dallas area would not prevail and that attempting to create a “mediation panel,” of Imams overseeing disputes between Muslims was not going to happen and publicly vowing to “fight with every fiber of my being against this action.”And fight she did, and what started out as a local issue soon gained a national and perhaps international spotlight, and soon Irving Texas became the “ground zero” the battleground between Islamic Law, and our American Judicial System, and whether this pervasive, destructive culture would gain a foothold in our imperfect civil society.Van Duyne worked relentlessly with other state legislators crafting a bill that could not be challenged within the courts declaring it illegal for any U.S. court to recognize any foreign legal system, to base it’s rulings on, and careful avoiding within the bill any mention of Islam or any reference to religion.The good mayor has of course been criticized by the mainstream media, along with the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR, who also routinely criticize President Trump which makes for a perfect union.Van Duyne on Thursday said she would be joining the Administration, and assist Secretary Ben Carson by bringing her expertise as a two-term mayor to HUD. Of course, congratulations are in order and wish Mayor Van Duyne much success. commentsBest free WordPress theme

491 Views Just a few weeks ago, Ben Carson compared slaves who were brought to American on slave ships to immigrants. It didn’t take long for The View host Whoopi Goldberg to call foul—but her comments on the incident are coming back to bite her in a major way.“That’s what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity,” Carson said in his speech. “There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less. But they too had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters, might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land.”Whoopi did not take kindly to the comments.“Ben Carson, please read or watch Roots. Most immigrants come here VOLUNTARILY can’t really say the same about the slaves…they were stolen,” she tweeted.She instantly got backlash for her comments.“@WhoopiGoldberg actually they were sold by black slave traders,” one Twitter user responded.
That’s an accurate comment, as bizarre as it may sound. Many slaves were sold to slave traders by their fellow Africans. Other slaves were actually white indentured servants. But Whoopi chose to ignore that fact to make a point, per usual. commentsBest free WordPress theme

430 Views Before he ever hit the campaign trail, Donald Trump was an outspoken critic of President Obama’s environmental regulations. So it’s hardly a surprise that just two months into his presidency, he has already taken action to reverse Obama’s detrimental policies.This week, Trump signed orders to repeal the core of Obama’s environmental legacy. The move to reverse these restrictive rules and regulations will bring the U.S. closer to energy independence and spur job growth.If Obama’s plans are implemented, CPP would have cost $41 billion annually—amounting to about $10.74 a month for every single American. And less than 39 percent of those paying that toll truly believe it is worth it, especially since it would have averted 0.019 Celsius of warming by the year 2100.Trump has also rolled back the Department of Interior’s Stream Protection Rule, which was put on the books shortly before Obama left office. The rule was designed to make it harder to mine on federal lands, but since Trump took office, U.S. coal production is already on the rise. It will likely bring back jobs along with it, a new report from the federal Energy Information Administration (EIA) reveals.Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Trump’s efforts.“The Trump administration’s rampage against the environment presents an existential threat to the entire planet,” John Podesta, Hillary’s former campaign manager, commented.What do you think?

199 Views In a recent appearance on Judge Jeanine Pirro’s show, Kellyanne Conway shared some shocking information that CNN has been hiding from the American public. They focus in on the same stories every day, ignoring all the good the President Donald Trump has done in the White House in just two months.“He’s creating jobs, he’s doing all these things that don’t get covered,” Conway began. “They don’t get covered on the altar of, what you said, the ‘R’ word.”“I still don’t know what Russia has done,” Pirro responded.“The mainstream media are making Americans suffer through information under-load,” Conway explained, noting that information about the increase in jobs, trade, and drug treatment are being ignored in the process.“I mean they say the same thing. Show after show, day after day,” Conway continued. “I know people talk about ‘fake news’ and ‘biased media,’ but it’s not just unfair coverage. That’s one thing. It’s everything that doesn’t get covered. It’s the incomplete coverage.”What do you think? Do you agree that the mainstream media is willfully hiding these stories from the public?

21 Views We remember the good ole’ days when aiding and abetting criminals was against the law. Apparently, that is not the case anymore—CNN proved that when they released an article giving undocumented immigrants tips for avoiding ICE.Here’s an excerpt from the outrageous article, entitled ‘5 must-have apps for undocumented immigrants’:“President Trump’s efforts to crack down on immigration have left millions of undocumented immigrants with an uncertain future in America. In response, digital entrepreneurs are using technology to help support this community. These five apps and tools arm undocumented immigrants with knowledge, safety, and moral support without compromising privacy.”To help lawbreakers avoid getting caught, CNN listed 5 apps including ‘Notifica.’ The app allows undocumented immigrants who are subject to a raid by ICE to send out an emergency warning to all of their contacts. The message will then disappear from your phone’s memory.“I want to do everything in my power to make sure that individuals aren’t afraid and they are able to live a life with dignity and respect that they deserve,” Adrian Reyna, founder and an undocumented immigrant herself, notes.What do you think? Should this type of behavior be illegal? commentsBest free WordPress theme

13 Views Recently, First Lady Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner relocated their family to a high-end neighborhood not far from her father’s White House. They sacrificed their lavish lives in New York to be of service to President Trump and his efforts.Unfortunately, Trump’s entire family has been attacked by liberals who are still furious that he won the election. After a group of disrespectful liberal protesters crossed the line, Ivanka’s 82-year-old neighbor stepped in to share a piece of his mind with them.The incident began when a group of liberal protesters camped in front of Ivanka’s house in Washington’s Kalorama neighborhood to throw a “Queer Dance Party for Climate Justice.” Finally, Ivanka’s neighbor left his house to confront reporter Ashley Rae Goldenberg, who he mistook for one of the protesters.“Invent something—do something!” he told her. A man who was with Ashley had the nerve to tell the elderly man that he ‘shouldn’t be so rude.’“Rude?! Do you want to get your f***ing face hit? You wanna fight with an 82-year-old man?! Ge the f*** out of here.”Watch the incident below and tell us what you think. Do you applaud Ivanka’s neighbor for taking a stand?The neighbors around Ivanka Trump’s house are upset.

Reportedly, the Oklahoma City Thunder and Boston Celtics have agreed to a megadeal. Reminiscent of the Kevin Garnett trade back in 2007, this leaves a number of wide open spots on the Celtics’ roster.Sources say the trade will send Russell Westbrook to the Celtics for Boston’s PF Amir Johnson, PG Isaiah Thomas, C Kelly Olynyk, PG Terry Rozier, and finally SF Gerald Green. The Thunder are expected to soon announce players to be released.The highly secretive talks were resurrected after a falling out a few months back. Sources close to the situation say the deal must still be approved by league offices before being official announced to the public, but the deal IS expected to go through without a hitch.This deal provides a major upgrade to the PG position for the Celtics and the start of a great core starring Westbrook and of course, Al Horford — who the Celtics repeatedly refused to trade.Unlike Westbrook, it was only a matter of time before this passed.The deal likely came as a result of Westbrook’s increasingly disgruntled dealings with the Thunder ownership and their weak attempts at filling out the roster after the departure of Kevin Durant.Westbrook’s 3 year deal from a few months back was clearly to help make it easier for the team to secure a worthwhile trade.Sources also suggest the Thunder may be part of the NBA’s proposed international expanision. The team may be moved to Mexico City in 2018, for a week’s worth of food from a Tijuana taco truck.Stay tuned to the DailyLeak for more updates.








Can a US state really ban a mobile game?Yes, it can when the game is deemed a “threat to the general populace” or a “public menace” based around “a satanic cult” or “hate group”– according to state authorities who refused to be named.It all began on Wednesday when a man in Arkansas named Carter Bryn was arrested for playing Pokemon Go in a major Baptist church. The congregation erupted in anger upon the realization, claiming the game was “Anti-Christian and Aimed Towards Satanists.”Imagine the surprise when what initially appeared to be an unsubstantiated, dubious claim was confirmed by the game’s creator, Satoshi Tajiri. He agreed that the games are clearly tailored towards an anti-Christian sentiment or Satanism. Tajiri admitted as much in a candid interview stating:I mean, some could say that the game supports Satanism. I don’t officially celebrate it, but I can understand why people would be attracted to it.So there you have it. He also admits in the interview that the games were created as a backlash against his overly-Christian parents.In response, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson denounced the game, claiming those who followed it were preaching hate, violence, and anti-Christian values. This simply would not be allowed in a state with a motto such as Regnat populus, meaning “the people rule” — and not some minority, devil-worshiping cult of miscreants.The ban, effective October 1st, will bring major fines down upon gamers who participate in any Pokemon Go related activities with the city limits of any city in Arkansas with a population over 2,000. The game will still be allowed in rural areas, so enjoy catching those Rattatas and Pidgeys.  Aside a from fine, anyone seen playing the game while driving could potentially be arrested and taken straight to jail. Do not Pokemon Go, do not collect 200 Digletts.This is not the first time Pokemon Go has been banned within a city’s limits, but certainly the first time an entire state has attempted such an endeavor. Des Moines, Washington is also making major strides in banning the game for fear it may be bring death and destruction to its fair town.Stay tuned to the DailyLeak for more important updates!

Kobe Bryant, never ready to turn down a challenge, has agreed to sign with the Golden State Warriors. No, not the Los Angeles Lakers. They are clearly no super-team, and nowhere near winning any sort of anything. Kobe “Bean” Bryant has chosen to only associate himself with greatness from this point forward.Bryant has agreed to suit up in a role better suited for the aging, nearly dead, former star of the world famous Lakers. The role, Bryant admitted, is part of a lifelong dream of his. A dream he’s held onto since he was only but a wee lad. To suit-up daily for a job reserved for only the best athletes, the most prolific of dunkers, and the goofiest of personalities.He knows it will be tough, but he wants only to assure his chance at a new Hall of Fame — for Mascots.Bryant has agreed, in part, to a contract rumored to be in the dozens. This deal will make him the NEW AND IMPROVED Golden State Warriors Mascot!After the Seattle Supersonics changed their name to “Thunder” and moved to Oklahoma City the Warriors have been stuck without a mascot. Theirs was also named Thunder and had to be eliminated. Bryant had been pining for the position with NBA Comissioner Adam Silver and Warriors owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber throughout the waning years of his career. Finally, his wish was granted and he got the go ahead to create a new character called “The Black Mamba.”Stay tuned to the NBA. The season kicks off October 25, 2016, so get ready for some great Mamba action coming soon.








Late Thursday afternoon President Obama said in a speech to supporters that he wished to seek an unprecedented 3rd term as Commander in Chief. He cited his exemplary work at bringing the country back from the brink of economic catastrophe much like former socially minded, populist leader Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Obama expressed his discontent with the current level of Republican and even Democratic contenders for the Office of President. Ted Cruz he thought, lacks the forward thinking vision of a successful president. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump he thought were too angry and lacked the personality of a member of the oval office.Flanked by a few of his most ardent Democrat supporters in Congress he announced the urgency to repeal a portion of the Constitution which forbids the president from seeking a 3rd term. Democrats have already pushed forth legislation which should accomplish just that.Obama stated:“I would put [my administration] up against any prior administration since FDR,” Obama said. “We didn’t ask for the challenges that we face, but we don’t shrink from them either.” He continued, “And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades. It will require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one. That is why I wish to pursue another term, so that I may right the wrongs of past Republican leadership, and lead the country to a brighter future.”President Obama will issue an executive order later next week expanding presidential powers and eliminating the 22nd Amendment, according to news reports published by the AP and Reuters. Obama promised in his speech to ensure Americans understand the importance of defeating ISIS, sacrificing a degree of privacy for vital security, and to institute major Wall Street reform. Also on his agenda is a high speed rail system to be finished in 2020 and paid for by new stimulus money he will attempt to push through Congress in 2015. Socially Liberal Democrats and Progressives cheered the move as a major step forward to a more generous nation-state. Citing Republican obstructionism as the main culprit in his failure to implement these policies he promised us back in his campaign of 2008, he claimed a 3rd and possibly 4th term would give him more of the time he so desperately deserved.








“Back To The Future” is coming soon to a theater near you. Robert Zemeckis, director and original Back to the Future is reportedly completely on board.Christopher Lloyd said he would ‘love‘ to return to the trilogy that made him into a famous time-traveling scientist.  That would undoubtably be difficult given Lloyd’s current age of 77. Michael J. Fox is also 54, but both could possibly serve as mentors to a new set of younger actors.
Studio executives have been bombarding all three for some time about a full 3 film reboot. The success of Universal’s “Jurassic World” had reminded that the people who once pined after these original films are now a bit older, have a bit more money, and are desperate for the nostalgia of their youth.
“It’s making them insane that we don’t want to do another ‘Back to the Future,’,” Zemeckis said. His reason? He knows that a reboot would open big, but that’s all they care about.








Donald Trump, “the Moron with a Mouth,”  has grown tired of pandering to liberals, immigrants, and of course, Muslim extremists. Reports close to the President-Elect has said he is responding to HUGE security threats by personally selecting a group of rag-tag mercenaries made up of former military roughnecks and violent psychopathic criminals.The recruits will all be part of a secret government agency tasked with executing black ops missions. They will report directly to ‘The Donald’ himself.Trump reportedly said this to his generals:“I want to put together a team of very bad people who I think can do some good.”Emphasizing his business acumen, he also stated in a heated exchange with Defense Secretary and former General James Mattis:“Getting people to act against their own self interest is what I do for a living.”In exchange for their service, convicts will receive reductions in their sentencing based around the severity and difficulty of the missions completed.Anticipating some push-back from The Batman, Trump started an early campaign in 2013 to turn the Caped Crusader over to his side.Everyone should calm down. @BenAffleck is going to do a great job as Batman.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2013So far the move has panned out well. Batman still has legitimate concerns that a true supervillain may replace Trump in the White House, such as a Mike Pence or even Lex Luthor.








Bernie Sanders has reportedly come under the microscope of the political watchdogs as accusations concerning the source of his campaign donations have come to light.An undisclosed watchdog group is making waves stating that Senator Sanders received campaign donations from the likes of Socialist presidents such as Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Cuban President Raúl Castro.Reports suggest there is no single “smoking gun” showing these donations influenced Sanders’ in writing policy or legislation.Still, critics contend the donations are “clearly illegal” under federal and international law.In his view, a donation by a foreign government to a SuperPac backing Sanders while he’s running for President of the United States is similar to sending money directly to him given their power to influence elections.“The Constitution of the United States states explicitly that a politician cannot take money from foreign governments without explicit permission of the Congress. The danger of corruption in the election system is nearly ,” Greensblatt said. “You had a Senator who says he’s more the people and won’t take corporate money, all the while he’s taking funding from foreign Socialist governments.”He continued, “My point is they took money from foreign governments while he was a Senator. That is clearly criminal in nature.”Sanders had long parroted the ills of capitalism to wanting audiences, particularly the young. Earlier this year he stated, “You don’t necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country. I don’t think the media appreciates the kind of stress that ordinary Americans are working on.”Sanders might want to pick up a copy of Economics for Dummies when he’s out an about promoting Marxist Egalitarianism.Sanders has not publicly voiced his support for the Venezuelan Socialist system but he has voiced his support for the British MP, and fellow socialist Jeremy Corbyn, who is not shy about his support for the deceased Hugo Chávez.








Russian President Vladimir Putin says that to avoid the increasing divide between America and Russia on the issues Bernie Sanders must become president.Taking a break from the situation in Syria, Putin found time to watch a replay of the democratic debate.“The clear winner was Sanders. Clinton side-stepped the real issues while Sanders showed his willingness to embrace change. He would be the best choice from all candidates running,” the Russian President stated.Vladimir Putin on Wednesday used RT to criticize the U.S. for failing in Syria and to voice his full support for Democrat Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who reportedly understood his own social and economic agenda.“We support the socialist government of America,” Putin said. Continuing, “Any 4th grade history student knows Capitalism has failed in every country, at every time in history. President Obama and his democrats are either idiots or purposely trying to destroy they own economy. And it’s my deep belief that any actions to the contrary in order to destroy the government will create a lawless situation which you can witness now in the other countries in the West.”Putin stated that Sanders must win to reduce gun violence in America and achieve lasting peace between their two countries.“When the state of Missouri deployed the National Guard to quell protests in Ferguson we were witness to American violence and destructiveness. Sanders, with his his experience, he can help them deal with their own extremists instead of creating new ones in Syria,” said Putin.We will have to wait and see if the Senator from Vermont can capture the nomination and the presidency.

The Washington Wizards announced they are finalizing a sign and trade deal to acquire Kevin Durant from the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday morning. The trade will reportedly net the Thunder franchise significant picks and cash considerations.Rumors had been swirling since the summer that Durant’s frustration is in winning a championship. Sources say frustration with the team’s unwillingness to spend big in free agency also encouraged Durant’s early departure.Durant had unabashedly stated his interest in the Wizards in earlier interviews saying, “Believe it or not, I wanted to play for the Washington Wizards, that was my favorite team. They were a new team when I was growing up, so I wanted to be a part of that.”John Wall went out of his way to woo the star small forward from her former franchise:“We’re really close. And like I said, when the opportunity arrived to go ahead and throw a pitch at him, I had to take the opportunity to do it. I will love playing with him because I know how talented he is.”A representative from the Thunder released a statement saying, “We are honored and blessed to have worked with Kevin during eight wonderful seasons in Oklahoma City. We wish him the best in the future.”Durant is reportedly pushing Agent Jay-Z to build him up as a larger, worldwide brand. Seeing the reception Lebron received in returning to his hometown of Cleveland likely encouraged Durant to follow his lead and pursue a trade to his hometown team in D.C.








In a controversial effort to cut losses and get something out of their beleaguered, oft-injured quarterback owner Jerry Jones decided to donate Tony Romo’s body to science.Jerry Jones stated, “we valued our time with Tony, but at some point we have to make a business decision. There appears to be a profit in this and literally no revenue streams should be left untapped. At this time cutting up our losses and selling them to the highest bidder just makes the most sense. Going forward, Cassell makes the most sense. I only hope Matt understands the consequences of poor play.”The Dallas Cowboys are also considering bringing in 41 year old Terrell Owens, but for what we’re not really sure, possibly to replace the injured wide receiver Dez Bryant.Jones called Romo Wednesday to inform him that he would donated to Planned Parenthood so that his brain and organs could be harvested for science. Romo reportedly did not responded positively, even shedding some tears at one point, but realized it was the best decision for the organization going forward. Jones congratulated him for taking one for the team.Jones also stated he at one point wish to sign Tim Tebow but thought he might not agree with his recent business decision.








Fox, Disney, and Sony all own the movie rights to certain Marvel properties. Disney, who bought Marvel Entertainment back in 2009, controlled the majority of Marvel characters, but desperately wanted to acquire X-Men and Fantastic Four.Relations between Disney and Fox had been sour for some time up until recently when Disney made a deal to get one of Marvel’s most famous characters, Spider-man. We’ll see him first in the upcoming 2016 film Captain America: Civil War.In recent years Marvel Studios has been quietly moving to reacquire all its proprietary superhero characters such as Namor, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch that it had sold off in order to avoid bankruptcy.Sources say it appears they’ve finally acquired the rights to the properties that had escaped their grasp.ScreenSlush reportedly sat down with Kevin Feige to talk about whether Marvel and Disney were now free to make an X-Men or Fantastic Four movie, and his answer was a resounding yes. Albeit with a caveat.It’s slightly more complicated than that. Let’s put it this way –we’ve removed some of the previous entanglements but there are still some hurdles to jump through. There are contracts that involve other parties. We now about the means to move forward with X-Men but there will still be dealings with Fox. As opposed to an Iron Man or Thor, where we can just throw them in, this is a little bit more complicated.Movie rights for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and related properties have become quite complex. No single studio owns the rights to all the Marvel characters. In this case it looks like 20th Century Fox has not given up rights to the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises, but we could likely see crossovers in film similar to what we’re seeing with Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch, and in the upcoming Captain America: Civil War movie starring Tom Holland as Spider-man.We will have to wait and see how Kevin Feige and the management at Marvel Studios choose to integrate their newly acquired characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.








A worry Seattle Seahawks fans have long been dreading finally came to fruition this morning. Anonymous sources the Seahawks sent SS Kam Chancellor to the Eagles for Center Jason Kelce and a 4th round pick.This move should help both teams solidify struggling parts of their respective squads. The Eagles secondary has given up too many big plays in the first two games of the season and the Seahawks have been struggling mightily in pass protection. Seahawks Drew Nowak may shift over to original position at defensive tackle. We could also see Malcom Jenkins move to his cornerback.“There’s been a lot of speculation regarding Chancellor being traded for the last few weeks,” an anonymous source stated. “The Seahawks and Kam Chancellor’s agent were simply to far apart on contract numbers.”Chancellor has shown little regard for fans on Twitter, blocking every fan who comments on his contract negotiations.Kam Chancellor’s blocking skills are so good on twitter he may consider coming back as an offensive lineman #Seahawks #liveonkomo— MIKE FERRERI (@MikeKOMOsports) September 16, 2015With Kam Chancellor coming back late in the season season there are some worries about him being in game shape, as well as his ability to quickly learn and help to improve the Eagles defense. Head coach Chip Kelly will have to grease the wheels to put the 0-2 team in serious playoff contention in the NFC East. Given the unfortunate injuries to Dez Bryant and Tony Romo overtaking the 2-0 Cowboys is looking a tad easier.In response Chancellor reportedly deleted his Twitter account then stomped his feet, flailed his arms around wildly, and threw a massive tantrum. Earl Thomas tried to get Kam to hug it out but Kam pushed him away.








Bill Belichick’s historic juggernaut that is the New England Patriots has searched far and wide for a quarterback to serve as Tom Brady’s replacement during the first 4 games of the upcoming suspension. From Tim Tebow, to Matt Flynn, to 45 year old quarterbacks, there don’t appear to be many options out there for this enigmatic franchise. Brady is expected to be out four games for his participation in #deflategate. He is currently appealing the decision with Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL. The penalty could be reduced to 2 games, or as fans hope, eliminated completely.In the meantime, Belichick needs insurance that his team will have a functional QB when the season starts. Aside from a couple otherworldly performances from Matt Flynn his career has a starter has been lackluster at best. This has left the Patriots’ head coach scratching his head and searching for creative answers. With the season slowly inching closer Belichick went back to the old NFL stalwart, Brett Favre.Per a league source, Favre has been released from the reserve/retired list. This allowed Favre to enter the waiver wire. Fortunately for the Patriots no other team even considered signing 45-year old Favre.The detailed are still be finalized but reports say he signed a heavily incentivized 1-year, $2.2 million dollar contract with New England. Most of his salary is dependent on his performance. The gunslinger will surely be prepared to conquer his foes on the field, ripped beard and all.Favre told reporters,“I can play,” Favre said. “As far as throwing. Of course, look at those ducks Peyton Manning throws in comparison to what I can do.” **flexes bicep**“Do I think I could play and lead a team? Look, no. But I could play. I could make all the throws I made before, I just couldn’t throw it near as far, but that never matters anyway.”








Stan Lee, long-time clairvoyant concerning everything in the Marvel universe, was hospitalized late Monday night after a long night on the set of Captain America: Civil War.Lee had been discussing the finer points of freedom, liberty, and true heroism with none other than Steve Rogers, or Captain America himself. Suddenly a flash! A bolt of lightning ripped out of the sky hitting him abruptly. Bang! The strike bounced off Lee and struck a container marked “Hazardous” releasing a burst of gamma radiation. This left the pugnacious Lee temporarily paralyzed. Why the actors were left on set in such precarious circumstances we may never know.Rogers quickly jumped into action and stopped Lee’s fall by catching Lee on his shield before he could hit the ground. An ambulance quickly arrived on scene and Rogers placed Lee into the back. In Rogers report he stated Lee had quietly moaned, “Excelsior!” before he shut the ambulance door.At the hospital in Atlanta, Georgia the enigmatic provocateur was placed into a containment unit in order to protect family, friends, and hospital workers from being exposed to any radiation. Although visitors were allowed into the late night their movements and interactions were strictly monitored.Around 2AM Lee insisted he be left alone for the night so he could get some rest. Reports show shortly thereafter, at around 3AM, a female figure with blonde hair, dressed in provocatively red attire appeared on the East wing of the hospital. She appeared not far from where Lee had been sleeping and appeared to be setting fires indiscriminately. Was she manifesting fire out of thin air?The figure made her way to Lee’s containment unit where she, possibly with the help of another, mysteriously moved from the hallway into Lee’s room without even opening a door. While there she administered a vial to the sleeping patient.An anonymous tipster called in at 6AM saying Lee would be visited by an Assassin known as Candra. However, it was too late. The deed had been done. It was too late to upgrade security. The local police and fire department had been too busy getting citizens to safety and putting out the growing fire.Lee woke up the next morning appearing fresh and considerably younger looking, albeit with a bit of a green hue, almost as if he’d been granted a new lease on life.








Hillary may have finally been stopped by the IRS of all agenciesWhat do Al Capone and Hillary Clinton have in common?On the surface, you would be correct in scratching your head and shrugging your shoulders; any of us would. After all, one is a notorious insider in the world of organized graft and corruption with allegations surrounding them of murders and ‘suicides’ to informants with scores of broken careers, lives, and blood on their hands. The other is Al ‘Scarface’ Capone, head of one of America’s most notorious prohibition era mobs.If you look with a discerning eye, similarities do emerge. Hillary Clinton was born in Chicago, Al Capone ran his underworld empire from there. Both grew up in the hard politics and life that is Chicago, Hillary in the elite circles, Capone buying off those in elite circles. Both have countless disappearances, mysteries, and deaths surrounding them.AdvertisementThere may very well be another link. A link that will astound and surprise many of you, the Federal Agency that ultimately hastens their downfall. It looks like that the very same agency that took down Capone in the 30’s when trafficking of alcohol, murder, and racketeering charges wouldn’t stick is potentially the same agency that will take down Hillary: the IRS.What goodies await us in The Clinton vaults?The Internal Revenue Service is investigating claims of ‘pay-to-play’ practices at the Clinton Foundation. Former prosecutor Katie Phang says an investigation such as this is usually serious but maybe not in this case. “Well, actually, normally I would say it’s pretty serious but we’ve seen with the whole Lois Lerner kind of email situation maybe it’s not going to be that heavy,” said Phang adding that the IRS should be as tough on the foundation as it would be with any other group.“Is the IRS really standing for the ‘Ineffective Review Service’ and not the Internal Revenue Service?  Is the tax exempt investigation that’s going to occur on the Clinton Foundation really going to reveal anything? Well, it should,” Phang told the FOX Business Network’s Ashley Webster.AdvertisementRep. Martha Blackburn (R-Tenn) has been leading a year-long push to investigate the Clinton use of funds which includes letters sent to the IRS and the FTC.For Blackburn, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is not a team builder. For over a year, Blackburn has been questioning the how the Clinton Foundation operates. She started with the IRS and followed up the Federal Trade Commission. “We sent a letter after the first of the year to the FTC asking about the charity [Clinton Foundation] and whether it was a scam charity,” she alleges that the Clinton Foundation gives about 15% of its donations to its missions far below the 50%-75%, other charities commit.“Interestingly enough what we heard back from them (FTC) was it was not a sham charity,” she added while noting that some charities have been shut down for giving less than 50%.At the Republican National Convention, she told FOXBusiness.com that the Clinton Foundation gives about 15% of its donations to its missions far below the 50%-75%, other charities commit. Despite her allegations, she said, “Interestingly enough what we heard back from them (FTC) was it was not a sham charity.”Advertisement“But is [IRS Commissioner] John Koskinen really going to look into the Clinton Foundation? It seems a little quid pro quo these days in terms of how the Clintons work with other people, so I’m not sure my confidence level is that high.” Conservative lawmakers are calling for Koskinen to be impeached for the way the IRS allegedly handled politically active nonprofits.In the end, Hillary is nothing more that a mobster in a pantsuitThe Democratic Party is no stranger to dealing with underworld elements. Rumors abound at the Kennedy Family’s ties to organized crime; there is the Daley’s of Chicago; Tammany Hall in New York; Jimmy Hoffa, the unions, and organized crime. So it would not at any lengths stretch the imagination to assume that the Clintons picked up a pointer or two on how to run a corrupt organization.When you think about it, one should be surprised if the DNC is not more run like an organized crime outfit. This past election cycle certainly showed that they know how to put the fix in and throw their own under the bus.Which brings us to the books and what may hide in the Clinton Vault.  Unlike the Geraldo Rivera episode on Al Capone’s vault, this one will reveal criminal collusion and conspiracy that could take down the current Administration (another Chicago alumni), several key corporate players from around the world and possibly right up to George Soros himself.AdvertisementUntil the IRS starts looking, we have no idea what goodies are hidden in their records. It will be earth-shattering, to say the least.Which makes it imperative that we install a new IRS commissioner, one that is not a lackey of Clinton of Obama; a commissioner that is dedicated to enforcing the tax code fairly and firmly, not inventing reasons to audit some while scrutinizing others as a form of political retribution.We need a strong IRS to track the trail of money, wherever it leads, willing to prosecute wrongdoing and blow the lid off all the secrets of the Clintons.Whether it is payoffs to Bill’s victims, pay for play access that nations and corporations that were corrupt bought to sway our government or even pizza sales, the whole unvarnished truth must be revealed. In the end, it will be revealed that Hillary Clinton is nothing more than a mobster in a pantsuit.Al Capone, Hillary and Bill Clinton, Barack Obama in this latest scandal involving the corrupt nature of Chicago-land politics and ways of doing business is falling victim to a saying of another Illinois politician, “You can fool some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the time. But you cannot fool all the people all of the time.”Abraham Lincoln is right in that regard, after 8 years of dirty dealing by the Obama’s and over 30 years of it from the Clintons, their attempts at fooling all the American people have finally starting to come to an end.Share:








Progressive liberal and Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos caught in bed with CIAWhen writing the 1st Amendment to the Constitution, one area of speech the Founders were specifically interested in protecting was that of a free press. They saw the press as a sort of fourth branch of government, one that would keep the “checks and balances” of the other three branches honest.However, over time the same press that was given protection has eroded into a propaganda machine driven by money and political agendas of those who own the media outlets. They have crawled into bed with the very entities they are to keep in “check” and bust out if corrupted.As such is the Mainstream Media today and one the American people no longer trust, and rightfully so given what is being exposed in recent years.AdvertisementThe majority of people do not know Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos purchased the Washington Post and is now the sole owner with no editorial board or ethical review committees to oversee the actions of Bezos as a publisher, much less the courage to stand against the new “boss.”It begs to question: How is Bezos connected to questionable intelligence leaks in recent months?What does he have to do with the sudden disruption of web services that kept millions from accessing whistle blowing website, WikiLeaks, during its explosive releases of state department cables?WikiLeaks Did A Lot Of Damage Against HillaryAdvertisementCables containing inside information revealing corruption within American politics linked to former secretary of state, and presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.The majority of Americans do not know ‘leaked” CIA documents to undermine a new president and administration were leaked through the Washington Post first and after Bezos took the helm of “America’s newspaper.”Much worse and even more suspicious is the majority of the people have not been informed that Bezos landed a $600 million federal contract and by who? The CIA.The “deal” is for a computing cloud developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It also just happens AWS services all 17 agencies within the US intelligence community.AdvertisementAn unholy alliance in which Bezos stands to gain many more millions by pacifying and working with the CIA through his publication The Washington Post. “Leaks” and “information” Bezos will publish without question, without proper verification and journalistic sourcing.The CIA will now have its own propaganda publication to do whatever it likes in misinforming and manipulating the American people and the voters.Vital information intentionally withheld from the American people, as Bezos uses the Post to forge pocket lining government contracts while promoting his own personal political agenda.Is this lack of reporting of the Bezos/CIA partnership by the MSM the result of massive incompetency? Or a very well organized cover up within the MSM inner circle of four or five elitists who now own six companies that control over 90 percent of MSM outlets?The same outlets which through diverse company divisions own every television station and newspaper in this country with the exception of very small, weekly community publications and certain Christian networks. Even many of those community weeklies have been scooped up by larger publication divisions.AdvertisementAre we connecting the dots at each cross section of intertwining strings holding together this corrupt spider web? A vast interlocking network designed to lure and trap average American citizens into its carefully woven web of manipulation and deceit.The Washington Post is the most widely known and respected news outlet in the world, reaching more people than any other publication including the NY Times. It has always been the standard in which journalistic ethics are established and adhered to by other publications. It sets the example to be followed by the everyday journalists out there on the beat trying to do their jobs.By utilizing the internet and social media, the Post has literally millions of subscribers and followers reading and watching online video on a daily basis. It is the media center of the nation’s capital and the eye of the DC political belt.Control the Washington Post and you control the message; the MSM and the “agenda.”“The Post is unquestionably the political paper of record in the United States, and how it covers governance sets the agenda for the balance of the news media,” journalism scholar Robert W. McChesney revealed to Altenet.org in a December investigative article.“Citizens need to know about this conflict of interest in the columns of the Post itself,” he added.In the same article, a statement released by the Public Institute of Advocacy quoted McChesney as saying:“If some official enemy of the United States had a comparable situation — say the owner of the dominant newspaper in Caracas was getting $600 million in secretive contracts from the Maduro government — the Post itself would lead the howling chorus impaling that newspaper and that government for making a mockery of a free press. It is time for the Post to take a dose of its own medicine.”If this alliance between the CIA and Bezos isn’t illegal, then it is certainly unethical and displays a huge conflict of interest while also exposing the corruption existing within the MSM. The main sources of news and information Americans sought and believed, until the rise of alternative media outlets.Alternative sources of information the MSM bash and attempt daily to discredit as “fake news,” when “fake,” misleading and sometimes right out lies being spread across social media come out of the MSM and pseudo extremist left-wing sites erected simply to misinform and confuse the American voter.Soros Funds A Lot Of These Media SourcesMany Facebook pages and websites that have “popped” up over the past several years whose resources and money are being funded by George Soros’s well oiled “Media Matters” machine. Just one of many “nonprofit” organizations extending from his Open Society Foundation.Soros also has imbedded ties to many MSM outlets including The New York Times, the Associated Press, NBC and ABC and here it is again, the Washington Post. Readers are urgently encouraged to research Soros, his history and his worldwide organizations.Altnet also writes, “Amazon’s offer wasn’t the low bid, but it won the CIA contract anyway by offering advanced high-tech ‘cloud’ infrastructure.”So how is at a time government should be pinching pennies due to the increasing national debt, the CIA passed over lower bidders for the contracted services?The answer tracks back to the infamous blocking of the WikiLeaks website by Bezos’s company Amazon Web Services (AWS), a service Bezos personally and publicly brags is the most advanced and best high-tech “cloud” infrastructure on the market.“WikiLeaks was booted from Amazon’s webhosting service AWS. So, at the height of public interest in what WikiLeaks was publishing, readers were unable to access the WikiLeaks website,” reported watchdog group Fair in 2013.So why did AWS give WikiLeaks the boot? Most likely at the bequest of the CIA, whom Bezos has been doing business with since 2013 when the $600 million contract was awarded to AWS. Bezos also has close ties to the Clintons and backed Hillary in her failed run for the presidency, both in the 2008 primary campaign and in 2016 as the Democrat nominee.Bezos also publicly voices open contempt for President Trump, and his policies. He recently was behind the Washington challenge to Trump’s 90-day immigration ban and threatened suit himself in an email to his employees, as was reported on this site.Bezos, without any reference to stock holders input or lack of agreement, said he will put the full resources at Amazon to defeat the policy and implied his mission of taking down President Trump.Bezos led the charge against General Flynn using his solely owned Washington Post.It was Bezos’s Washington Post that first leaked documents and led the charge to discredit Trump’s national security advisor cabinet pick. General Michael Flynn was forced to resign due to the unverified information touted in the “leaks.” Flynn was cleared by the FBI of any wrongdoing in those leaks. But the damage was already done.In recent days, it has been revealed the CIA has full intention of attempting a coup to remove Trump from office, even though “The Donald” was democratically elected by American voters in a free election.And it appears in the CIA is in conspiracy with Bezos’s plan to use the Washington Post to achieve a mutual goal: to disrupt and destroy President Trump and his administration. A goal that has no regard or concern for national security or the safety and well-being of American citizens.Any impact on the average citizen, including possible loss of life by terrorist attacks is considered “collateral damage.”In an exchange of tweets on Feb. 15, John Schindler, former NSA analyst and national security columnist for the Observer answered a question asking what he thought was going on at the NSA right now. Schneider responded, citing a friend in the intelligence community reference to Trump:Now we go nuclear. IC war going to new levels. Just got an EM fm senior IC friend, it began: "He will die in jail."https://t.co/e6FxCclVqT— John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017Which begs a bigger question than the unethical alliance between the CIA, Bezos and his Washington Post:Could Trump be impeached? Of is he in danger of befalling the same fate as President Kennedy? Being a previous “anti-establishment” president, Kennedy sought to disengage from the Vietnam conflict and dissolve the Federal Reserve, but was assassinated.Actions that directly impacted the CIA and wealthy elitists.Share:








Sick Bill Knows He Has Been ExposedLast night, October 10th, Donald Trump served and represented the Conservative party well during the second presidential debate. Friday, October 7th, a tape of Trump saying some unfavorable things magically surfaced before the big date was scheduled to air live.However, Trump didn’t let this phase him. He was confident, dominant, and displayed every quality a noble leader should when he was on stage against Hillary Clinton.Hillary Knows She Is In TroubleAdvertisementHe clearly mopped the floor with crooked Hillary, despite what CNN reports.Hillary Clinton said, “You know, it is uh, it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.” Donald J. Trump nonchalantly replied, “Because you’d be in jail.”The crowd roared.We all know Trump is not the most politically correct individual and he thrives on speaking his mind. This is the reason he is favorable among many Republicans and appealing to undecided voters. However, the tape of Trump hitting on a married woman from eleven years ago made many Republicans worry Trump would retaliate against Clinton for campaigning against him, calling him a misogynistic, egotistic man.AdvertisementBut, something happened shortly after the old tape was released, something that has never happened before– Donald Trump apologized for what he has said.In a statement made by Trump himself, “The Donald” can be seen taking responsibility for his words. He owned up to something poor he said over a decade ago, humbling himself in the process, reminding us all that his adventures during this presidential campaign have helped him grow as a person.Working closely with blue-collared employees and listening to their grievances has helped him become a better man. You can see the sincerity but ferocity in Donald Trump’s eyes as he realizes what he has said years ago is wrong yet there is nothing he can do to change it.If that is the game Clinton is playing, then that is the game the Republican party should throw back in her face. Words said versus actions performed decades ago. Let’s see how the treatment of women pans out for Clinton and why she’s recently scrubbed the statement, “Rape victims have a right to be believed” off of her website (she plugs during each presidential debate).AdvertisementHillary could have retracted this statement given that Bill Clinton has assaulted many women and she destroyed a twelve year old rape victim in court years ago, but we are talking about the Clintons.Coming to light Friday NOT covered by the paid-off mainstream media is Juanita Broaddrick, a rape victim of Bill Clinton’s. According to Breitbart, Juanita was allegedly raped when she was thirty five years old in Arkansas. Her terrifying story sheds light to a gruesome attack by Bill Clinton and also Hillary Clinton, who tried to cover up, bully and intimidate the woman, attempting to ruin Juanita’s life. Hillary didn’t care that Bill was cheating or raping women and young girls, she only cared that he got caught and she had to clean up the messes.Juanita Broaddrick is not the only alleged victim of rape by Bill Clinton to step forward, Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey also made their presence known at Sunday night’s debate in St Louis, Missouri. All of these women testified that Bill Clinton forced himself onto them and bit their faces so hard that their faces were bruised and bleeding.AdvertisementTasteful, strategic and well thought out, Trump stood next to Hillary Clinton triumphantly as these four women looked at him as a knight in shining armor. He was going to slay the wicked witch who became a living nightmare for these victims of Bill Clinton’s sexual assault. Actions do speak louder than words, after all.Kathy Shelton, the twelve year old that Hillary Clinton called a liar and told the court “fantasized about older men” was also there, supporting Trump. No one asks to be raped and surely no one asks about the extremities of this then-child’s anguish of being beaten so badly and raped so viciously that the child fell into a coma for ten days and had to be “stitched up down there”. Kathy also was told after the incident that she would never be able to have children.She still cries about the attack to this day, but she is being strong, standing up for herself and rape victims everywhere in joining Trump at the debate. After Hillary represented the monster that raped Kathy when she was twelve, Hillary laughed in a recording, “He took a lie detector test! I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs (chuckling and laughing).” These are the real words of an evil monster- these are words correlated with heinous actions we must be disgusted by.Let’s be real here, in 2005, Donald Trump was a business man and reality star king. He was not a politician and had no reason to care about what he said, he was just trying to fit in with the Hollywood crowd and never had to watch his steps. It’s very easy to be criticized by people like Hillary Clinton and her colleagues, who have been involved with politics nearly their entire lives and also by people that do not live an extravagant, billionaire lifestyle.Trump supporters feared that Donald Trump would bring up Bill Clinton’s past with alleged rape, getting involved in a messy back and forth with Clinton, taking attention away from the true topics and policies at hand during the second debate. Presidential debates are a platform to discuss economics and how to solve problems, not throw insults at one another like a five year old. Trump gave a stellar performance during the second debate, staying on topic and appearing to be very comfortable, not falling for Hillary Clinton’s bait. Trump is right- actions are louder than words and those four women being at the debate had a huge impact on the ambiance of the night.The first debate on September 26th was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton. In the following video, you can clearly see the likes of a computer screen or teleprompter go off after the debate ends. Watch as the lights have already come on, people have already risen and then suddenly, her podium top fades into black. Trump’s podium never changes.A man quickly gathers things from Clinton’s podium, which is also slightly smaller than Trump’s, making her appear to be bigger and more powerful than she really is. Dressed in a bright red pantsuit, she definitely appeared larger than she normally does. They always say ‘watch out for the lady in red’.It is also suggested by major world pro poker player and other poker pros, Mike Matusow, that Clinton was signaling the moderator, Lester Holt, so Clinton could get her zingers in. It is also leaked that Clinton had the questions a week in advance and that the Clinton campaign intimidated Lester Holt or paid him off.She did seem rather confident and scripted and it is because the first debate was corrupt. It was like Trump did more debating with Lester Holt than he did with Hillary Clinton.All claims that Trump was domineering and creepily following Hillary Clinton around the stage to “intimidate her” are completely wrong and false. Trump was cheated out of the first debate and he did not want to be cheated out again. It is also safe to say this corrupt woman is paying $200,000,000 to slander Trump’s name and bring up distasteful things he’s said decades ago.Yes, decades ago, These remarks were made years ago, not yesterday.Words versus actions from years ago–who’s the true champion of women?Share:








Police Investigate Home Invasion in Wagoner County, Oklahoma (pictured above).Every citizen of the United States is endowed with the constitutional right to protect their property and family with a firearm. Despite this extremely wise piece of legislation, the authoritarian left seeks to have it destroyed. This is while they push for policies that would let more dangerous people into our country. They must be stopped. Guns are one of the few ways to really stand a chance against a home invader. The case in favor of ownership is extremely strong. Earlier in the week, a 23-year-old man, Zach Peters, saved his family from armed intruders by shooting and killing all of them with an AR-15. This was an excellent example of why the Second Amendment is important. Although the act was incredibly heroic, not everyone sees it that way. In response to the shooting, one of the deceased teens’ family members spoke out for the first time, calling it unfair. Leroy Schumacher, the grandfather of one of the people killed, spoke out against the killing. He argued it was unfair to shoot his grandson even though he had violently broken into a private residence armed with a weapon. By doing so, he appears to be taking the side of the intruders, despite the fact that they may have also been murderers, given the opportunity.AdvertisementSchumacher acknowledges the fact that his grandson made a terrible decision, saying, “what these three boys did was stupid,” but claims his grandson never got into trouble. When discussing the incident, he didn’t appear to take into account the fact that they outnumbered Peters three to one. Instead, he said, “brass knuckles against an AR-15, come on, who was afraid for their life,” suggesting the criminals did not stand a chance.But it’s not just the fact that they had brass knuckles. They also had a knife. Brass knuckles and knives are extremely dangerous. Both have the potential to kill someone very easily. But even if the intruders didn’t have any weapons, the family could’ve been killed by a single punch. On top of that, they outnumbered him three to one. Further, armed and violent intruders aren’t supposed to have a chance to do anything. They may use it as an opportunity to attack and kill.Not to mention that Peters was in his own home, which he has every right to defend with just about whatever means he sees fit. He chose an AR-15. Others, since it was a close-quarters encounter, may have chosen a handgun instead.AR-15, the rifle Zach Peters used to defend himself.AdvertisementAccording to the grandfather, “they knew they could be punished for it but they did not deserve to die.” Yet once again, this statement appears to not take into account the facts of the case. The very act of breaking and entering is enough to justify the shooting.But they didn’t just do that. The three teens also dressed themselves up to conceal their identity and look intimidating. It would have been frightening to see three strangers dressed in normal clothing. Seeing them all dressed in black, wearing masks and brandishing weapons, must have been especially terrifying. Sometimes people flee when they are afraid, and sometimes they react like an action hero, channeling their adrenaline into focus. The son of the homeowner responded with the latter. Also, the intruders displayed aggression by shattering the glass of the backdoor. Peters was reasonably afraid for his life and did what he had to do to protect his family from an immediate threat.Even so, Schumacher insists that “there’s got to be a limit to that law,” adding “I mean he shot all three of them; there was no need for that.” Yet it’s unclear what the grandfather would have preferred instead. The teens broke into the house wielding dangerous weapons, indicating they were willing to use violence if given the opportunity. If the son of the homeowner did not shoot, he could have been overpowered and killed by the three attackers.While it’s true the teens may have left if asked politely, it seems unreasonable to take on that risk. It would be tragic for an armed homeowner to be killed because they hesitated. The intruders are already in the guilty of a life-threatening crime. The lives of the innocent are not worth an attempt at diplomacy. If the situation was different, and three armed, masked intruders broke into his grandson’s house while he was still alive, would he still feel the same?AdvertisementWhat’s worse, the grandfather blames Peters, the victim of the crime, for the suffering of the felons’ families. “These boys’ families are going to suffer with this the rest of their lives, we have to live with this the rest of our lives,” he argues.But blaming the homeowner for the pain caused by the teens’ decision to break the law is reprehensible. The burglars aren’t just to blame for the attempted crime or the duress experienced by the homeowner. They’re also responsible for causing their own families suffering. Their actions led to their deaths, which not only affected them, but their families as well. They behaved in a way that put their lives at risk and showed no consideration for their loved ones. Their families have to live with the consequences of their actions.However, despite the loss of family, Schumacher is somewhat optimistic. “You can’t change history, but you can damn sure learn from it, and maybe some kids will learn from this,” he reasons.Peters is not expected to be charged for the shooting on March 28th. He clearly acted in self-defense. The three teenage thugs made the decision to find a house to break into. They then drove to a seemingly peaceful neighborhood and found a house to loot. Before the robbery, they donned masks and gloves and wore all black. They also brought brass knuckles and a knife in the event they met any resistance. They then drove to the house and trespassed onto the family’s private property, making their first mistake. Their second mistake was smashing the glass of the backdoor, waking the son of the homeowner, who immediately armed himself. Their third and final mistake was actually stepping foot into the house. AdvertisementZachary Peters, Criminal Justice Student and Part Time Action Hero.Upon breaking the glass of the backdoor, the three teens woke up Peters, who grabbed his AR-15 and raced to investigate. What he saw next terrified him. In his home, where he expected to feel the safest, were three armed burglars. Outnumbered, and in imminent danger, he shot and killed all three of them.Peters was rightly in the comfort of his own home, which he has every right to defend from intruders, and the invaders carried weapons, causing the family to be in imminent danger. The worst thing that the teens did was step foot inside the house. That’s really the only thing that matters and the main reason why the son of the homeowner was justified in shooting the potential killers.When someone breaks into a house and the homeowner is there, it tends to go one of two ways. The outcome usually depends on whether or not the homeowner has a gun. This means that the situation could have been much different if the authoritarian left successfully destroyed the Second Amendment. If a person doesn’t have a gun, the outcome doesn’t tend to be in their favor. However, if a person does have a gun, the situation usually ends much differently.If Peters didn’t have a gun, he could have been overwhelmed. They already demonstrated poor decision making by breaking into the house. It seems to follow that they could’ve easily made more poor decisions if they had the opportunity, such as murdering the family. The family could have easily been beaten to death. Or worse, they could’ve been killed with the knife.An accomplice to the group was waiting in the getaway car and managed to escape the scene, abandoning the others. She later turned herself into police claiming to have planned the entire operation. Authorities reported that the group broke into the house after first burglarizing another part of the same neighborhood earlier. Information about a fifth person, who investigators say is a witness, has yet to be released.The identities of all four are now public. The three that were killed were 19-year-old Maxwell Cook, 17-year-old Jacob Redfern and 16-year-old Jaykob Woodriff. The getaway driver was Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, a 23-year-old mother of three. After being arrested, she showed remorse and appeared to understand why Peters reacted the way he did. Specifically, she said,  “I know what we did was stupid and wrong. I don’t blame him. … I understand why he did what he did. I mean, I do to an extent.”The three that were killed were 19-year-old Maxwell Cook, 17-year-old Jacob Redfern and 16-year-old Jaykob Woodriff. The one that fled was Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, a 23-year-old mother of three.Despite the desperate attempts by the authoritarian left, the right to bear arms must be protected. Liberals advocate for policies that would leave the most vulnerable incapable of leveling the playing field. They’ll be unable to defend themselves or protect their families and loved ones. The grandfather of the dead felon only makes things worse by bringing up legislation that puts more lives at risk. Share:








In Russia, 14 people were killed and at least 40 injured in a blast tied to Islamic radicals.It has been the drive of the left and Democrats to say, “Russia did it,” or “blame Russia,” for every problem common today. If Trump wins the election, Putin did it. If Trump talks about peace with the former Soviet state, it is because the claw of the Bear controls America’s president, and so on. At this point, if it rains, is too hot, too cold, or too gray, it is all the fault of the Russians! The problem with this line of thinking is that it hides the real threat in the world: radical sharia Islam. While nuclear war is never off of the table as long as Putin is in power, Muslims are the ones who are focused on killing everyone. If Russia and America are thought of as two gunshots firing back and forth, radical Islam is a grenade that takes them both out.The Russians have learned this awful truth as news today shows that those who bombed St. Petersburg this week were tied to that very form of Islam. It was not the “evil Mr. Trump” or America that killed 14 innocent people and injured about 40 others, but once again those who claim to teach peace. This fact has been reported by the Russian news agency, Interfax, who said that law enforcement investigators found evidence of a suicide bombing.Russia has been seeing both threats of terror and horrendous acts for quite some time.AdvertisementBreitbart News is reporting that “Kyrgyzstan’s security service GKNB” has named the suspect as Akbarzhon Jalilov, a “22-year-old Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen.” This could prove a point of contention because, just as in Orlando, when some of those involved are native to the nation, then it is not an “Islamic” problem to those on the left. Then again, except for some mad abortion clinic bombers “for Christ,” how many religions blow things up with the consistency of sharia Islam? To ask this question may be against political correctness, but it must be asked just the same. Then again, since there seems to be also evidence of help from ISIS, according to GKNB, then the argument may prove moot.Kyrgyzstan was once under the rule, it is noted, of the Soviet Union. This persisted until 1991 when they became sovereign, and while they are a majority Muslim nation, the remain a close ally and friend to Russia even today. This is true even though Russia is largely made up of Christian Russian Orthodoxy practitioners, not Islamists. Roughly six million people reside in the nation and those close ties are why Kyrgyzstan has security forces “maintaining contact with the Russian secret service for further investigation.” It is clearly in the best interest of that nation to find any parties still living and to bring them to justice.How much terror must Russia and the U.S. see before the find peace through a common enemy.We know that supporters of ISIS were in full celebration mode once news of the senseless attack hit the news cycle and began to trend online. Just as we saw on 9/11 when jubilance took over many Muslim communities after the towers crushed 3,000 people (some who were Islamic), so we are seeing it again. This will come into play when nations begin to ponder why countries all over the world are opening their borders to a religion that has so many unstable people in it. Innocents need to be saved, but clearly, they need such a rescue to happen in their own nations because the current system seems to be failing terribly. Not just because this may have been done by refugees (we have no proof of that), but because radical Islam is spreading like bed bugs.AdvertisementOne ISIS supporter even proclaimed proudly that the attack was due to Putin supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assa as he wages war against the evil caliphate. The same Breitbart article then mentions that ISIS put out a video showing an explosion being seen through by a radical terrorist with the words, “kill them where you find them” as its grim message. Also, what is being called “Russia’s transport infrastructure” has suffered countless attacks from the terror cell recently.There is no sign whatsoever that ISIS aggression is being tamed by Putin’s actions alone.This shows that our modern world can go in either two directions. We have spoken before about how the Pilgrims only bested the Indians in massive numbers because the Native American’s were already fighting many wars between themselves. They were too divided to unify against the English threat. There were so many more of them than there were of the settlers that victory should have been fiercely assured. Due to divisions (more than gunpowder or smallpox), the Indian’s lost.Today, Russia and America could turn ISIS into something similar to what would be left of an anthill after a jackhammer was used upon it. We would not even need to hint at the words, “nukes.” There would not be so much as a bomb wick seen in Syria nor Iraq for the next fifty years after the clean up was done. Best of all, innocent Muslims (who DO really exist) would not be slaughtered as they lived side by side with Coptic Christians and others. It would take no more than a handshake and a bit of humanity between Putin and Donald Trump. After that, it would take, what, six months? With such a duo fighting, maybe even less.AdvertisementIn words, the two leaders agree. Now ISIS must cease or be stopped by deeds and actions.Trump is a man who wants wars to end again. He wants ticker tape parades and soldiers kissing maidens in the street. The last thing that he wants is for a long, drawn out war in the Middle East to start costing too much for him to make America great once again. Therefore, the dominoes are all in a line. It is as if some great cosmic hand has allowed the two strongest powers on the globe to suffer the same terror from the same evil at the same time. The mirror that stood in front of Don Quixote was not so vivid as that which we are looking into now. There are two choices; we either unite to stop a common enemy or we all get used to praying whilst facing East to a god who is alien to our culture. If this is doubted, one need only ask the Native Americans.Share:








This home had their American Flag set on fire in Phoenix, Arizona.When someone works hard and puts a great deal of their effort into something, it matters. Regardless of what the work has gone into, whether it be a family restaurant or perhaps many years of service that someone has put into one company, it is important. These efforts are a testimony to their lives. This applies to sports legends and astronauts, as well as to plumbers and tree-trimmers. That said, effort matters to no one more than to the men and women who choose to sign up (and those formally drafted) to serve the United States of America via the armed forces. This truth was lost on some unappreciative flag burners who set Old Glory on fire as if it were a candlewick at the home of a veteran in Phoenix, Arizona.KPNX-TV has reported that on Saturday, Marine Vet Brian Ellison awoke to find the burned up remnants of his flag that had been flying proudly in front of his home. Sad pieces of cloth were littered about his driveway as the only evidence of the crime, something that will make the arsonist all but impossible to find. “[sic] There’s two big pieces that you feel when you see something like that,” confessed Ellison, “You’re sad, and you’re mad. There’s not a lot that you can do about either one of them. So I came home and put another flag up.”Flag burner targets Ahwatukee couple https://t.co/UOkjfk35dB pic.twitter.com/cIiXCDKzsJAdvertisement— 12 News (@12News) April 2, 2017While the police in Phoenix have been notified and a report has been filed, it remains to be seen what, if anything, can be done. His wife, Lisa Ellison, said that upon seeing the disgrace, her husband looked “like somebody shot him. He just was devastated that somebody would do this.” While no political motive has been mentioned, it is true that flag burners have been seen more often since the rise of Trump by the left that hates him. It is happening more and more, including at the RNC, at Democratic protest spots all over the nation and other areas.While disrespect of the flag has always been a part of us (unfortunately), it has never been more common than it is today. While it is their flag to burn if they so choose, it should ALSO be the businesses right to refuse service to such people, too. It seems that such real freedom of expression like THAT would be “offensive” to the “sensitive” flag burners.AdvertisementRegardless of the motive, this dangerous prank (which is also what it may have been) happened in what Fox News is calling a quiet neighborhood. “The flag means everything to me,” the brave veteran said, “When you say your oath and you join the military you stand in front of that flag when you raise your right hand. When we lose a service member or a veteran dies we put it on the casket.” That means, be this protest or prank, someone has all but spat in the face of someone who risked their lives to keep them free.Whether as malice or as a misguided joke, this was a dangerous and vile act.Let us imagine for a moment that Mr. Ellison had seen the act as it was in progress and drew a weapon. What if he even used a weapon? Beyond the justified rage that one would feel upon seeing the action in motion, what is the just reaction to setting a man’s house on fire with his family inside? The left would argue that such violence is uncalled for, but they would never address the rights of the actual victim in doing so. The fact is that there are these kinds of thoughtless people shot every day, such as the news last week in Oklahoma where a band of wayward teens broke into a home and were shot dead. Today, the getaway driver faces murder charges and there are a lot of unhappy families trying to come to terms with compounded tragedies.We all know that Donald Trump signs were vandalized during the election season (this author’s experience) and that property which was pro-Trump saw attacks quite often. We also witness a large number of silly “Tom Foolery” kind of pranking that see’s countless Baby Jesus’s stolen from mangers and put on Harley’s every year, so not everything has malice as the motive. Many acts have general stupidity as a motive, something that no one’s life is immune to. Still, to show such a terrible disgrace to not only safety, but pride, this is a crime that must stand out from the pack.AdvertisementIn Oklahoma, this getaway driver is facing murder charges when their home defiling plans went astray. This could be how those in Phoenix meet their end if they are not halted.It can be hoped that Ellison and his wife will also install some security camera’s in and around the home, though at this time no statement on the matter exists. Either way, those who committed this act likely did not read about the above stated Oklahoma story in between sitcoms and reality shows. Such a person is not likely to see the report on Fox News, either. Due to that, they may not know that homeowners in Phoenix have read the papers and seen the news, however, and they are now ready for anyone that comes to potentially burn their home down with them in it. The result of this could be quite tragic, yet another reason for those who have done this to be found, if possible. Their lives may depend upon knowing that NOW is the time to stop, while they are still alive.If this was a political protest of some kind, then it is even more vile. Purposeful thoughtlessness is far worse than pure simple-mindedness, and at that level, one can argue that it is attempted murder. If someone is engaged in the process and following the laws and news cycle enough to know what they are doing with intent and to attack a veteran, then they know enough to be considered more than teenage pranksters drunk off of their first acquired beer. If protesters on EITHER side are EVER let off lightly due to it simply being “a form of political protest,” then we are in for some dark, dark days, indeed.Phoenix, Arizona, (pictured) is a city that is now alerted to the flag burners who defiled a veterans house.With the attention from Fox News, KPNX-TV, the Conservative Daily Post, and others, hopefully, these fire-starters can be found. Such people often boast of their crimes, so it can be reasoned that Phoenix home dwellers have a better than average shot at this leading to an arrest. If not, then there are some very foolish people at large in Arizona who are not only putting tenants and homeowners at risk, but themselves as well.ANYONE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRIME MAY CALL THE PHOENIX POLICE AT Call 602-262-6151Share:








Trump is not done fighting to keep his promise of “great healthcare” for the American people. He has not forgotten his word.One of the many baseless accusations that are often hurled at President Donald Trump is that he is rigid; an unmovable man. This is a common thing said about many men with conviction, and while it is true on a macro level, it usually is not true on a micro one. While Trump may be utterly unmovable on his pledge to shred every word of Obamacare to confetti, he is not as planted on how it is to be done.The fact is, even the most diehard supporter of the President will declare that despite the red hat still being proudly worn, “Ryancare sucked.” Thankfully for us all, Trump is not the man portrayed by the media, but one that is open to fixing the healthcare problem in other ways, since it remains. After all, Trump had no hand in the construction of “Ryancare,” a fact that the MSM loves to purposefully overlook as they blame the President for its failure.Some say that Trump is a businessman and not a politician (a fact that his base adores), but then again, former President Barack Obama was not a doctor. That fact did not stop him from playing one while in office and giving America the blight on healthcare called “The Affordable Care Act.” Trump is taking the smarter approach and using his business mind to do what business giants do, and that is to consult those who know how to tackle a problem when one arises. This is how Dr. Rand Paul (R-KY) ended up on the president’s golf course to talk about the repeal and replacing of Obamacare. This happened in spite of the fact that Paul was one of the most vocal opponents to Ryan’s plan.AdvertisementSome in the media predicted that Trump and Paul would never golf again as they had in times prior following sour campaign words. Thankfully, that is not the case.Trump could not have chosen a better person to tee off with, since not only is Dr. Paul a PhD, but so was his father, liberty legend, Ron Paul. It is not a secret that while the President and Paul have golfed together before, things soured during the campaign with short jokes and abortion talk destroying Paul’s run. Still, it was Paul who supported Trump the loudest during the fake Russian sex news row, something that Trump likely remembered. It showed that he could count on Rand Paul to be fair in his praise or condemnation apart from any bickering that happens. Not only that, but from a business perspective, members of the Paul family are some of the most knowledgeable doctors in American politics. As such, they know what works for both care and costs. More importantly, they know what does NOT work.America’s leader had just tweeted his assurance to the people that talks about repeal/replace were going on and that those talks “will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.” He also declared that anyone who thinks that the deal is “dead” is someone who “does not know the love and strength in R Party!” In the end, even though such matters as healthcare are meant to be state’s issues FAR removed from the burdensome hand of the federal government, having the best medical minds in Congress crafting the language is vital.For that reason, even Constitutionalists can be happy that such a man as Rand Paul is getting a say in this. It can be imagined that Paul may golf his worst game ever as he pleads his case; a humorous thought when one considers how animated Rand can become. It is not often that a libertarian-leaning mind gets the President’s ear for such a long time. America needs the Dr. at his very best here.AdvertisementBudget Director Mick Mulvaney (pictured) was also on the greens with Rand Paul and Donald Trump.White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said that the president talked about some policy ideas with not only Dr. Paul, but also budget director, Mick Mulvaney. This is why so many of the people who make up the Trump base are delighted with the fact that he IS a businessman. While it may be nice to allow every facelift, abortion and tummy tuck to happen on the government’s dime, it is just not practical.That kind of “be nice to everyone at any cost” mindset is why a decent man like Bernie Sanders was betrayed by the religious base of which he would count himself a member. It may sound nice to give everyone as much as they need for free, but the facts are different. Those realities say that care must happen to those that need it before they are wasted upon those that want them, or the system shall crash. We are already seeing the failing caused by the overextension of government promises with Social Security and Obamacare itself.Dr. Rand Paul (pictured) will have ideas that will make the American healthcare system much stronger. Look for states to compete, for instance, under Paul’s vision.AdvertisementPaul saw the failing of Ryancare as a “great day” for the President because it saved him seeing “his” failed healthcare plan replacing Obama’s. Replacing “awful” with “not as bad,” so to speak, is not what Dr. Paul felt was the best that America could offer. “I continue to be very optimistic that we are getting closer and closer to an agreement on replacing Obamacare,” he said.In an article that appeared Sunday in the Financial times, it is reported that Trump said “I don’t like to lose. But that wasn’t a definitive day. They are negotiating as we speak.” In other words, the battle is lost, but the war shall be won! Just as he did not win all Primary States to secure his nomination, he need not win every attempt to secure an overall victory. These are life lessons for a country who has lost her way. This is why he said also, “I didn’t want to take a vote. It was my idea. One way or the other, I promised the people great health care. We are going to have great health care in this country.” His base needn’t lose hope, his promises were made to be kept.Trump tweeted this message to his loyal fanbase who were promised “great healthcare” via repeal and replace.We have nothing etched in stone about what Trumpcare 2.0 shall be, but we do know that everyone is hearing from furious voters that Trump promised a REPEAL and that what Paul Ryan delivered did not cut it. Ryan’s bill just amended the healthcare act, something which would only delay its collapse. The people have chosen to allow the federal government tinker with healthcare, and they are demanding that it be both reasonable in cost and effective in nature. For that happen, it is important to talk to doctors, not politicians. Even a “dumb” businessman knows that.Share:








Wreckage of St. Petersburg train station after explosion of shrapnel briefcase bomb.Today one bomb went off in an underground train in St. Petersburg, Russia. It has been reported by Russia’s Anti-Terrorist Committee that 10 people have been killed and that 50 or more have been injured, some grievously. Authorities and citizens jumped into action in the smoke-filled subway station, coming to the aid of their fellow citizens.The amount of injuries indicate that this was a somewhat crowded train car, perhaps a commuter train.RATC has also confirmed that there was another bomb found on another train that did not detonate. Teams were sent in to disarm the bomb and did so successfully.AdvertisementDestruction of the train car.All 62 St. Petersburg metro stations are now closed. The city is on high alert, knowing they may have caught a break with only half of the bombs working.The train car, on its way to the Technical Institute, exploded between stations. Windows blown out, the metal doors of the train nearly blown off; the force of the bomb was extreme.It is currently being reported that the explosion was caused by a briefcase bomb.AdvertisementThere are reports that the bombs were filled with shrapnel. The means that the severity of some of the injuries could be fatal and thus the death toll could climb. One eyewitness described victims of the attack as being ‘mutilated’.CCTV has released an image of the suspected attacker. The man’s image was captured by security cameras in the St. Petersburg train station. Pictured here, the alleged attacker dons a beard and a cap.#ЭКСКЛЮЗИВПубликуем фото предполагаемого террориста, устроившего #взрыв в #метро Петербурга: https://t.co/6IYGIorlFV pic.twitter.com/6Po3RCy46f— РЕН ТВ | Новости (@rentvchannel) April 3, 2017AdvertisementThe Governor of St. Petersburg has come out and said, “Law enforcement authorities and all city services are doing everything necessary….In this difficult time we all need to support those who lost their loved ones. I ask all Peterburgers and guests of our city to be vigilant, attentive and careful.”President Vladimir Putin has also made a statement, “The causes are not clear, it’s too early. We will look at all possible causes, terrorism as well as common crime.”Putin is scheduled to be in St. Petersburg today.Putin happens to be in St. Petersburg today for a meeting with the President of Belarus. One is left to wonder whether there is a connection between Putin’s presence and the attack or if they were merely coincidence.AdvertisementThough no terrorist organization has claimed responsibility, and Russian authorities are not ruling out other criminal possibilities, this attack would fit with the trend of previous terror attacks in Russia.In 2004, male suicide bombers blew themselves up in a Moscow Metro station, killing 41 Muscovites.In 2009 there was a deadly attack on a high-speed train going through Russia. In this attack 27 people were killed. The cause of the derailment and the deaths was a homemade chemical bomb.In 2010 two women suicide bombers, sometimes known in Russia as ‘shahidka’, or ‘black widows’, attacked Moscow Metro. The results were 40 deaths and 100 injuries. These women were Muslim.Volgograd was targeted in 2013, their transportation was attacked on two consecutive days by ethnic Russians who converted to Islam. On December 29, one man attacked a train station. On December 30, another man attacked a trolleybus. Thirty-two people were killed in total and 85 more were injured.The 2016 assassination of the Russian ambassador by a Turkish national.Most recently, at the end of 2016, Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated while giving a speech at a museum in Istanbul. This attack was a lone-wolf, an off-duty police officer, who shot the ambassador in the back. The assassin called out ‘Allahu Akbar’ and screamed that the Turks should never forget what the Russians have done in Syria.Putin’s responses to these attacks have been verbally strong. He denounced, immediately, that the assassination was a terror attack.In 2013, Putin responded to the Volgograd attack with, “We will strongly and decisively continue the battle against terrorists until their total annihilation.”Putin continues to wage his battle against terrorists, both foreign and domestic, who appear to have struck again today in the heart of Russia. In the coming hours, we will find out if the culprit is the Chechens who have repeatedly attacked Russia, or if this attack has something to do with Russia’s involvement in Iraq and Syria.We can be sure, if it becomes clear that this was a terrorist attack, that Russia’s leader will signal that his country does not have tolerance for terrorism and his intentions to eradicate it from Russia’s midst. Time will tell if he is able to keep his promise this time.The rest of the world watches the events unfold today and recognizes that the tide of terrorism is not ceasing. These sorts of attacks may continue for the foreseeable future if nothing is done.Share:








Donald Trump called the dossier “fake news” and Buzzfeed “a failing pile of garbage.”Cyprus-based Russian businessman Aleksei Gubarev is suing Buzzfeed for defamation after they published an unproven 35-page dossier linking him to a supposed conspiracy theory. It claimed that Russian intelligence attacked the computers of Democratic Party leadership and blackmailed Donald Trump with lurid sex tapes. The suit alleges that Buzzfeed has done personal and financial harm to himself, his wife and his companies.At the time the complaint was filed, the dossier had been viewed 5.9 million times. Gubarev’s attorneys wrote that Gubarev “has found his personal and professional reputation in tatters” and that his wife has received harassment online.Gubarev runs a business of considerable scope. He is chairman and CEO of XBT Holdings, which owns Webzilla Inc., a Dallas based web hosting company. Gubarev operates 75,000 computer servers total worldwide. Both companies are mentioned in the dossier.AdvertisementGubarev denies all allegations contained in the dossier. He told the McClatchy DC Bureau that despite his role in the dossier no United States authorities have contacted him. With a vast global array of servers, Gubarev is highly aware and sensitive to any hacking or cyber-attacks against him.Tucker Carlson confronted Ben Smith, editor of Buzzfeed News, over his decision to publish the dossier.The dossier alleges that Gubarev’s companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla Inc., used “botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct ‘altering operations’ against the Democratic Party leadership.” The dossier also claims that Gubarev was “recruited under duress by the FSB.” The FSB is the intelligence organization that succeeded the KGB after the fall of the Soviet Union. Gubarev’s attorneys assert that these claims are wholly false.This is the same dossier that includes the now infamous “golden showers” claim. It says that while in Moscow in 2013 Donald Trump paid Russian prostitutes to urinate on a bed that Barack and Michelle Obama had slept in, supposedly as a way of expressing his deep hatred for the Obamas. The dossier claims that Russian intelligence is holding proof of this occurrence over Trump’s head, compromising his ability to act in America’s interests as President.AdvertisementThere is no proof for the validity of the material in the dossier, and the document has been widely viewed as a complete fabrication. Nonetheless, it has provided fodder for Donald Trump’s enemies to make insinuations against his character and his loyalty to the country.In March 2016, a Florida jury awarded pro-wrestler Hulk Hogan $115 million in damages. He successfully sued Gawker Media for violation of privacy after they published a sex tape that damaged his career. This court decision led Gawker to close down the same year. It later turned out that tech-giant Peter Thiel, who is now an advisor to Donald Trump, donated $10 million to help fund Hogan’s case against Gawker, which outed Thiel as a gay man in 2007. Also according to Thiel, Gawker “ruined people’s lives for no reason.”Hulk Hogan was awarded $115 million by a Florida court in a lawsuit against Gawker.Gawker and Buzzfeed are similar types of outlets, and this could be an interesting case to watch, as a successful businessman goes after this media company for publishing rumors damaging to his career. It was a Florida jury that sided with Hogan, and Gubarev’s legal team is fighting to pursue the lawsuit in Florida. Buzzfeed wants to have it proceed in New York. Gubarev’s attorneys contest that request in their latest filing, arguing that there is grounds for conducting the trial in Florida and that Buzzfeed simply wants a New York court because it will be more favorable to them.AdvertisementBuzzfeed News Editor Ben Smith, who made the decision to publish the dossier, defended his decision by saying that the public deserved to have access to this information. He argued that because many people in the media and government had seen the dossier, and certain people were referring to it as evidence, the public ought to see it too.It is an interesting argument, and it is worth keeping in mind that the obviously false nature of the document undermines the credibility of news organizations and people in government and the intelligence community who were treating it as serious. It arguably helps Donald Trump in the long run to have this absurd document exposed.On the other hand, its release has implanted the meme into the minds of committed opponents and haters of Trump that he really is compromised by the Russians. And when someone wants to stoop low in slandering the President, they can allude to this dossier. It would be absurd to think that Ben Smith did not know that releasing this document would do damage to Donald Trump, even if there are some potential upsides for Trump.There is of course no potential upside for the Russian businessman Gubarev.During a press conference Donald Trump called Buzzfeed a “failing pile of garbage.” The non-news side of Buzzfeed has produced divisive, aggressively anti-white content.AdvertisementThe dossier was put together by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, and given to the FBI by Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). Steele is the director of London-based Orbis Business Intelligence. Steele was an officer for MI6, the foreign intelligence agency of the British government. He has declined to be interviewed by newspapers. He was born in Saudi Arabia, and was known as a “confirmed Socialist” during his days at Cambridge University. He was recruited straight out of Cambridge into MI6 and worked as an agent in Moscow.The way the dossier came into being reveals the widespread bipartisan fear of Donald Trump winning the election. This intrigue with the dossier and the continued promotion of the Trump as Russian agent narrative are indicative of the deep institutional resistance to Donald Trump. He is a total outsider with many policy goals that go against the establishment grain, which helped him become President.Concerned parties in the Republican party during the primary process contacted the private research firm Fusion GPS to do research on Trump to look into possible connections between Trump and Russia. After Trump secured the nomination, Democrats took over the financing of the Fusion GPS opposition research, suggesting significant closeness between certain Republicans and Democrats. After the Democrats took over the operation, Steele was contacted to do research. Steele then passed on his research to both British and American intelligence.Later on, the British Ambassador to Moscow alerted John McCain to the existence of the dossier, who obtained it and passed it on to FBI director James Comey. A two-page summary was presented to then-President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump in meetings with intelligence heads.John McCain played a key role in promoting the dossier within the government.The consequences of Republicans and Democrats working together to produce this dossier will continue to play out for President Trump and for Russian businessman Aleksei Gubarev. Patriots can only hope that any wrongdoers in this debacle face consequences as well.Share:








Utah governor is pleased with confirming a 120-year-old law.As early as 1862, the United States had deemed polygamy a crime. In Utah, where approximately two-thirds of the population is Mormon, plural marriages have been a felony since it became a state in 1896. Over 120 year laters, lawmakers in LDS state are creating hype over confirming the law; and practicioners are demanding their rights.In 1879, the Supreme Court upheld the anti-polygamy to be constitutional. Beginning in 1880, federal officials began prosecuting those cases. The large communities of Mormons, or Latter-day Saints (LDS), were largely left alone. In places like Utah, polygamy was common and ignored. The church claims that the problems began when Mormons began spreading out across America. Non-church members saw the multiple-partner marriages as an abomination.As they expanded, the church took a harder stance on polygamy, denying that it was still going on and trying to explain it. “The Book of Mormon identifies one reason for God to command it: to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant in order to “raise up seed unto [the Lord]” (Jacob 2:30). Plural marriage did result in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes.”AdvertisementSimultaneously admitting and defending their actions, they were telling the public that it had stopped. “…monogamy was advocated in the Church both over the pulpit and through the press. On an exceptional basis, some new plural marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904, especially in Mexico and Canada, outside the jurisdiction of U.S. law; a small number of plural marriages were performed within the United States during those years. In 1904, the Church strictly prohibited new plural marriages. Today, any person who practices plural marriage cannot become or remain a member of the Church.”As the LDS church was struggling to present an acceptable and legal view to the public, polygamy was ongoing. Church members and often high-ranking leaders were accused of not only having multiple wives but taking underage brides and abuse. Women leaving the church were finally talking about their experiences.You might expect all the scandals would top the practice, or at least force it further underground. Neither happened, starting in 2010 there has even been a reality television show about polygamy called Sister Wives.AdvertisementUtah Governor Gary Herbert promoted his activities this week as he signed a bill that “keeps polygamy a felony.” Apparently the penalties have changed, becoming harsher, but that appears to be the only difference.As he makes this highly flouted but non-momentous decision, the question is being asked, is the law even being enforced? The answer is convoluted.Mormons who practice the lifestyle are open and uncompromising; they will continue despite the laws, as they always have. They and their attorneys say that if the marriages are between consenting adults, the state can’t do anything. Joe Darger, an outspoken opponent of the bill, has three wives. He dared officials to charge him with a crime.Some lawmakers seem to agree, the state doesn’t pursue polygamists who haven’t committed other fraud or abuse as well. The recent bill was actually in response to a lawsuit that occured when they did try.AdvertisementJoe Darger, center, challenged lawmakers to come after him for his polygamous relationships.The Brown family, stars of the show Sister Wives, sued Lehi, Utah city police for looking into their multi-partner relationship. The court ruled in favor of the Browns, raising many questions about polygamy.This led to the state of Utah and the courts defining the difference between polygamy and bigamy. While often used interchangeably, the law states that bigamy is a punishable crime, polygamy is not. Polygamy is “defined as three or more people living together and one or more ‘spiritual’ marriages existing among that group.”On the other hand, bigamy is the practice of one person having “multiple active marriage licenses.” The splitting of hairs in definitions would force prosecutors to prove that each polygamist has coinciding, active marriage licenses. This makes them a bigamist which is the actual felony.AdvertisementOutside of that, it is simply seen as a lifestyle choice. A man can have as many wives as he wants as long as he only has one marriage license. When Federal Judge Clark Waddoups ruled for the Browns in 2013, he was essentially saying that the bigamy laws could not be applied to polygamists.Children being exploited is one of the many issues the polygamous lifestyle can encourage.The new law confirms that the state agrees with his assessment. To be considered a bigamist, the offender now has to live with his extra spouse and claim marriage. Only one or the other was required prior to this.Even the Sound Choices Coalition, which tries to discourage polygamous marriages, supports the new bill. They issued a statement saying;“Polygamy is an antisocial, unsustainable practice that hurts many, so we are pleased that the state of Utah has taken action to demonstrate that it takes the abuses of polygamy seriously. Polygamy has enjoyed de facto decriminalization for decades, and polygamists will continue to be in no danger of prosecution unless they commit other crimes. We trust that the attorney general’s office will use this new law as it uncovers criminal activities within polygamist communities.”The disconnect in the state was apparent through all of this. Polygamists continue to insist that any investigation or prosecution impedes their rights. Lawmakers prepare to take a hard stance, but it may only be for the cameras.Is polygamy a choice or is it forced on women by an unrelenting religious community? Should it be allowed if all the people involved are adults? How hard is law enforcement working to tell the difference?All those questions remain, the bill changes little. It is neglectful to avoid the fact that the practice encourages wrongful and unlawful behavior. Religious freedom does not allow child endangerment or abuse. Utah doesn’t need to reinforce laws they have never followed in the first place. They need a serious discussion on the practice of polygamy and what it means for innocent women and children.Share:








The USDA places these traps to kill; that is exactly what they do.“The M-44 ejector device is an effective and environmentally sound wildlife damage management tool. The spring-activated device delivers a dose of cyanide powder to targeted animals. It uses a cyanide capsule that is registered as a restricted-use pesticide by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The device can be used only by trained certified applicators.”This “trap” is what Canyon Mansfield, age 14, came across while walking his dog one day. The pair was reportedly only about 350 feet from their family’s home. Canyon told reporters, “I see this little pipe that looked like a sprinkler sticking out of the ground. I go over and touch it. Then it makes a pop sound and it spews orange gas everywhere.”The orange gas that covered them was cyanide, placed in the ground by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), to kill so-called nuisance animals. Advertisement“The M-44 device is triggered when a canid (i.e. coyote or wild dog) tugs on the baited capsule holder, releasing the plunger and ejecting sodium cyanide powder into the animal’s mouth. The sodium cyanide quickly reacts with moisture in the animal’s mouth, releasing hydrogen cyanide gas. Unconsciousness, followed by death, is very quick, normally within 1 to 5 minutes after the device is triggered. Animals killed by sodium cyanide appear to show no overt signs of distress or pain.”Doing its job, the device killed a dog that day in Pocatello, Idaho, but not a wild one. The family’s 3-year-old Yellow Labrador Casey died quickly, just like the USDA says it would.“We are devastated,” mother, Theresa Mansfield, told Fox News. “My dog died in less than 2 minutes. My son was rushed to the hospital covered in cyanide.”Canyon was able to think quickly, wiping as much of the poison off as he could. It possibly saved his life. Fortunately, there was no rain that day. Otherwise the moisture-reactive cyanide might have killed the boy as well.AdvertisementIt may have just been luck that Canyon wasn’t killed along with Casey.Captain Dan Argyle of the Bannock County Sheriff’s Office said, “We’re still trying to figure out how he wasn’t affected. We think a strong wind blew it [the cyanide] downhill when the device went off — right in the dog’s direction.”The government maintains that the traps are not capable of killing a child. Captain Argyle strongly disagrees, stating that Canyon only weighs about 20 pound more than the dog. “He’s very lucky to be alive.” The teenager’s blood will continue to be checked for cyanide levels.The USDA Wildlife Service’s website claims that the traps are designed to “control coyotes, wild (feral) dogs, and red, gray, and arctic foxes.” The average weight of a coyote is between 20 and 50 pounds. AdvertisementCoincidentally, the same weight as a one-year to seven-year-old girl or a 10-month to seven-year old boy. If a younger child had been with the dog, he or she could easily have been poisoned to death.According to Captain Argyle, and the USDA website, there are supposed to be signs posted to warn people about any traps in the area. That brings to mind large, easily-seen, weatherproof warnings. Unfortunately, that is not the case.The signs that the USDA places close to the deadly traps. They are neither durable nor adequate.The signs could be easily covered by snow, washed away by rain, or torn out of the ground by wind or animals. The website also claims they do not place traps on property without permission, either from the landowner or the government.Captain Argyle said, “We did not observe any signs at the location.” Canyon’s father, Mark Mansfield, confirmed, “We didn’t know anything about it. No neighborhood notifications and our local authorities didn’t know anything about them. The sheriff deputies who went up there didn’t even know what a cyanide bomb was.”AdvertisementThe danger was increased when an inspection revealed another trap close to the Mansfield home. Apparently, both were set on February 25, “without the family’s knowledge or consent.”The device that exploded and killed a family pet.This is not the only incident. Earlier in the week, the Helfrieck family was out on a walking trail they have used for 20 years. They were approximately 50 miles from Casper, Wyoming. On the trail was Amy Helfrieck, her husband, and their 8-year-old daughter. Mrs. Helfrieck’s sister and brother-in-law were also with them.Suddently hearing her husband yelling, she turned to see him carrying their dog and running towards her. Mrs. Helfrieck, who is a nurse, attempted to open the dog’s mouth to help Abby breath. “She was having a lot of difficulty breathing and I knew at that time she was dying. What I didn’t realize was that we were exposing ourselves to a very deadly poison.”The sister’s dog Molly was also killed. The family reports there were the required signs. However, they were placed only about 5 feet away from the trap, leaving no early warning for the hikers. The Helfrieck’s daughter and a picture of Abby.These traps, very effective against pets, are used to prevent wild animals from attacking and killing livestock. The USDA states;“Coyotes, foxes, and feral dogs cause substantial damage to livestock and poultry producers, particularly those with sheep and goats. After studying a petition to ban the M-44, EPA determined that predation accounts for a significant portion of premature livestock losses. EPA found that the use of M-44s have significant benefits in reducing predation on livestock without negative long-term impact on the target predators or other nontarget species.”The two families who have lost their beloved pets would certainly disagree with that statement. Other critics argue that taxpayers should not be spending money to protect private property. The traps are unselective. They cannot distinguish between predators after livestock and those who are just hunting.A wildlife advocacy organization called Predator Defense is part of the movement to ban these devices. Brooks Fahy, the executive director, calls the traps “nothing more than landmines waiting to go off, no matter if their victim is a child, a dog or a wolf.”He further explains that, “Much of the public remains totally in the dark about the fact that these deadly devices are placed on private and public lands nationwide. M-44s are totally indiscriminate. Worse yet, they are unnecessary, as the majority of the animals killed have never preyed on livestock.”These recent incidents demonstrate the rationale behind Fahy’s words. If a rancher needs to control predators on their land, they have a right. However, traps placed on public lands are harming innocent people and animals. This method is outdated, expensive, and deadly to the wrong animals. Next time it could easily be a child.Share:








Arkansas authorities are investigating the case of a corpse stuffed inside a suitcase and abandoned in a farmer’s field.Arkansas police have been working to solve the case of a corpse stuffed inside a suitcase and abandoned in a field. Late last week the corpse was identified as Robert Brooks, an 89-year old WWII veteran from Youngstown, New York. The body wasn’t dismembered as the man was only four feet and eleven inches. Police don’t consider it a homicide at this point.David Gilbo, of the Youngstown Police Department, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, “He was a war hero who could have been buried at the [Arlington] National Cemetery. Instead, he ends up in a suitcase dumped in a field in Arkansas.”Gilbo said the man died of natural causes in his home likely about a month before his body was found March 5, Fox News reports. He had been living in upstate New York with his caregiver, 56-year old Virginia Colvin. She had cared for him since 2012. Colvin’s boyfriend, Michael Stivers, was also present in the home.Advertisement“Why did they decide to take the body from here, instead of calling for an ambulance, is yet to be determined,” Johnstown Police Lt. Dave Gilbo told WRGB, a CBS affiliate in Albany.Right now, the authorities think the couple did not report his death in order to keep collecting his Social Security benefits. They have checked the couple’s bank statements. If that was the case, no monies have thus far been collected.“They got caught early,” Gilbo told the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette. “We are checking their bank statements, but they didn’t have much time to collect any money if they were doing that.”Colvin told authorities that Brooks had always expressed his desire to be buried in Arkansas and that’s why they were moving him there. Family members deny the claim, saying that Brooks had briefly lived in Arkansas at one point, but was from New York. He not told his family that he wanted to be buried anywhere else. Both Colvin and Stivers have family members in the state. They drove from New York to Arkansas, some 1,300 miles, with the month-old corpse in a large blue suitcase riding in the back of blue pickup truck. On March 5, they stopped in Des Arc, Arkansas. That was when police received the emergency call, the Washington Post reports. The call described a couple selling furniture and junk from the back of a parked truck when the morbid discovery was made.Advertisement“One of the patrons of this sale went to the back of the truck and unzipped a larger blue suitcase and saw a body,” Prairie County Sheriff Rick Hickman told ABC affiliate Sky 7.The pair fled the scene, getting about 15 miles out of town. They stopped to dump the suitcase in a farmer’s field in Prairie County and then split. Police caught up with them but released Colvin because they could not find the incriminating suitcase. Stiver, however, was arrested on an outstanding warrant for not paying child support.Virginia Colvin and boyfriend Michael Stivers are charged with abusing the corpse of an 89 year-old World War II veteran.The deputies located the house where Colvin was going in Perry County and placed it under surveillance until they could get a search warrant. On March 8, the police finally connected Colvin to the incident and arrested her. Both Colvin and Stivers face felony charges of abusing a corpse. Police have finally made contact with Brooks’ son in North Carolina and obtained DNA samples from him to confirm the identity of the body.AdvertisementLonoke County Jail, where Michael Stivers is being held on a child support warrant while awaiting felony charges on abusing a corpse.New York authorities are not attempting to get the couple extradited. Abuse of a corpse is a felony offense, but in New York it only punishable by three years in prison. In Arkansas it carries a punishment of up to ten years. Brooks was a gunner in World War II, serving in a B-17 bomber’s ball turret.“It’s the most dangerous assignment in war,” Prairie County Sheriff Rick Hickman said. “The belly gunner is in a small bubble on the bottom of the plane. The enemy wants to shoot at him first. Life expectancy on that job is very short.”The authorities handling the case say that, while it is not considered a homicide at this point, it could take months to officially determine that. It will take some time to find out why the body was moved as well. “Brooks was a World War II veteran,” Gilbo said. “He deserved a lot better than being put in a suitcase.”Police are still working on getting to the bottom of the motives in the case of this veteran. Now, with his son located, arrangements can be made to have his body moved back to New York and given a proper burial. But the two in the middle of it, however, have a long road ahead of them.Share:








Tennessee Just Filed A Lawsuit Against The Federal Government Over The Federal Refugee Resettlement ProgramRefugees were a big topic of discussion during the 2016 presidential election. Democrats, like Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama, wanted to invite every single refugee into the country. The problem was they didn’t think about the vetting process and how important it is for American safety.These refugees need to be thoroughly vetted because of the areas that they are coming from. Several countries that these refugees are originally from are known terrorist hot spots. Terrorist groups, like ISIS, have already admitted that some of their agents are posing as refugees to get into the country to cause some major damage.Unfortunately the Democrats just don’t understand the worry that Americans have over this and continue to support bringing refugees in through a federal program. Finally, one state has had enough of the federal refugee resettlement program. The state of Tennessee has officially filed a lawsuit against the federal government over the resettlement of refugees in the state.AdvertisementThe Thomas More Law Center filed the federal lawsuit for the Tennessee General Assembly, as well as the State of Tennessee. It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee on Monday. As stated earlier, it’s challenging the federal refugee resettlement program. What Tennessee is arguing is that it violates the state’s sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution.Tennessee Doesn’t Want Refugees In Their StateTo escalate this even further, President Trump is expected to hold a rally in Nashville to create public support for his agenda. That includes his revised travel ban. It suspends the federal refugee resettlement program and stops travel from six Muslim-majority countries. It’s expected to go into effect on Thursday.Back in April of 2016, the Tennessee General Assembly passed SJR 467. What it did was authorize the filing of the lawsuit. It was meant to address the federal government’s appropriation of state funds to continue this program in Tennessee. Suing the federal government is a big deal, and it only escalates when it is one of the states that are on the prosecuting side.AdvertisementOriginally in 2007, Tennessee withdrew from the federal program. However the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement went around this by designating Catholic Charities of Tennessee to force the continuation of state funds to resettle those refugees that go to the state.It’s worth pointing out that the federal government isn’t allowed to force states to support federal programs with state revenues. In other words, the federal government can’t force the states to pay for something using their own money.The late Senator Ted Kennedy addressed this. He was the chief sponsor of the Refugee Act of 1980, which was the enabling legislation, and spoke on the Senate floor prior to it being passed.“… the committee was mindful of the deep concern of many State and local agencies that Federal assistance authorized under these programs should be for a reasonable period of time – to assure that local communities will not be taxed for a program they did not initiate.”AdvertisementHowever, as most things tend to do with the government, the rules dramatically changed within a decade of the act. Originally, 100 percent of each state’s Medicaid and welfare benefits given to refugees would be reimbursed by the government. They would provide these benefits to refugees in the country for three years.States Were Supposed To Be Reimbursed For The Resettlement Of Refugees. That Stopped After 10 YearsFive years later, Congress didn’t provide sufficient funding and the costs of the federal program began falling on state governments. By ten years, the government stopped all reimbursement of state costs. As expected, it has been a giant financial burden on the states.Remember, the federal government can’t force states to support their programs using state revenues. States know this and they have started taking notice. The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2010 looked at a review of the refugee admissions program. They were taking note of the costs that were associated with education and healthcare for refugees that were passed onto the state and local governments.According to the Superintendent for Fort Wayne (IN) Community Schools, the cost of educating refugee students “regularly diverted [funds] from other programs.” It should also be noted that the Fort Wayne-Allen County Commissioner of Health testified that “[i]ncreasingly the costs of [HIV/AIDS] tests are being dropped on the laps of local and state governments.”AdvertisementThey are also footing the cost for the life-long treatment for hepatitis B discovered among the Burmese. It’s “…another significant cost the local community will be forced to bear.” The lawsuit wants to define Tennessee’s rights, considering the forced use of state funds for a program they’re not even a part of.State Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris was the one who led the passage of SJR 467. He described the suit as looking for relief. The suit “…offers a unique mechanism by which advocates may seek to remedy ongoing violations of statutory or constitutional law. Sometimes it’s cast in the nature of a friendly lawsuit to bring clarity to an otherwise cloudy situation.”The main reason for the institution of the travel ban was to get a vetting process that would make the country safer. This is necessary, especially when it was learned that 300 refugees in the United States are under FBI investigation for terrorism. These are people that pose a significant risk to the country. Why should more of them be let in?It Was Learned That 300 Refugees Were Being Investigated For Ties To TerrorismNot to mention that many migrants and refugees that come into the country lie about their age. They literally falsify information so that they can get into the country easier. When a majority of these refugees are lying to get into the country, there is something drastically wrong there.Share this article to show that Tennessee has just filed a lawsuit against the federal government. They are not a part of the federal program, yet they are still forced to use their revenues to resettle refugees in their own state. This lawsuit is going to get some answers, and it might lead to more states doing the same thing. Be sure to watch this one carefully.Share:








Students have had enoughHave you ever considered the political affiliation of college professors? Many haven’t unless they have attended college classes lately or have children in college. That is perhaps why they numbers are skewed in regards to liberal versus conservative professors.The recent election and the ensuing liberal meltdowns have turned our eyes to campuses and how they are reacting. The view has been disheartening. Colleges appear to be overwhelmingly liberal, both professors and students demonstrating their dominance.Samuel Abrams, a professor of politics at Sarah Lawrence College, decided to take a look at 25 years of survey data. The results were astonishing; the amount of liberal professors has tripled since 1989.AdvertisementThe proportion of liberal professors rose from 2-to-1 in 1989 to 6-to-1 in 2014. New England saw the largest shift, going from an abnormally high 5-1 ratio in 1989 to an overwhelming 28-1 in 2014.This leaves college students subjected to an increasing amount of rhetoric from their professors. Should politics even have a place in the college classroom? That is another issue completely.Republican Senator Mark Chelgren from Iowa is on a mission to change the discrepancies. He believes that by requiring professors to disclose their political affiliation, balance can be restored. He aims to do this with the introduction of a new bill in the Iowa government.SF 288 states that “a person shall not be hired as a professor or instructor” if that “person’s political party affiliation on the date of hire would cause the percentage of the faculty belonging to one political party to exceed by 10 percent the percentage of the faculty belonging to the other political party.”AdvertisementThe bill would only apply to “institutions governed by the Iowa Board of Regents, those being the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, and the University of Northern Iowa.”There is a rather large loop-hole though. Prospective faculty would have the choice of declaring “no party affiliation,” and thus would “not be considered in determining the political party composition of the faculty.”While this seems to defeat the purpose of the bill, Chelgren accounted for that. “The state commissioner of elections” would be obligated to “furnish, free of charge, voter registration records to the institutions of higher learning.”Iowa is similar to many states; voters are not required to disclose their party affiliation when registering. However, primary and caucus elections are only open to voters who officially identify with the party holding them. This means that to actually vote, the party of the voter must eventually be disclosed, giving more information to inquirers.AdvertisementIowa voted Republican in the 2016 election, that may indicate this bill has a chanceThe reasoning behind this bill is simple. Take a look at the actions of professors and college administrators and you get an immediate idea of the brainwashing that is occurring.Professors allowed students to miss or reschedule exams if they were feeling “traumatized” by the November elections.Riots have been breaking out on campus with alarming frequency. Not just protests but actual riots. Berkeley has been the site of many, causing millions of dollars in damages to the campuses.Students are out of controlAdvertisementCalifornia State University administrators have recently issued memos encouraging students to not cooperate with Immigration and Custom Enforcement officials. Instead they are told to call campus police and wait for legal representation.Republican students have been the targets of intimidation and violence. Students attempting to start conservative groups have been shut down. Trump supporters have been frequently attacked. Liberals allow for no dissent; their selfish minds just cannot handle conversations where they may be proven wrong.These and other incidents occurring all across the country have created a hostile environment on campuses. Colleges have become more about pushing one set of ideals on everyone rather than encouraging balanced discussions and actual learning from others’ ideas. The purpose of colleges is to educate not indoctrinate.Needless to say, there are many who are opposing this legislation in Iowa.“The Board of Regents is opposed to the bill,” spokesman Josh Lehman told The Washington Post. “We expect our universities to hire the most qualified faculty to teach our students, and we believe in diversity of thought.”Senator Herman Quirmbach told reporters, “To establish quotas by political party association in academic departments would just destroy our public universities. It’s one of the worst ideas I’ve heard in 15 years here.”Democrats in Iowa are firmly opposed to the new billRepresentative Mary Mascher cites discrimination; “We do have a Constitution and its there for a reason, and it’s to try to protect equity and to make sure that we don’t judge people on the basis of their race or religion, their creed, their political beliefs. We never ask that question when someone’s hired: Are you a Republican, Democrat, or independent, or Green Party, or socialist, or any of that. And I think that would be clearly discriminatory.”Her arguments in particular lack the element of truth. Liberals have been demonstrating a clear misunderstanding of “discrimination” these days. They continue to make assumptions and decisions based solely on political affiliation and religion more than any Republican ever could.The battle in Iowa is just beginning. With President Trump threatening federal funding withdrawl for colleges who continue to break the law, debates such as this one will be happening everywhere. Democrats cannot continue to just pretend that President Trump doesn’t exist. He is gaining traction while they lose it.Something has to change. The blatant entitlement that is being encouraged is approaching a breaking point. Citizens and lawmakers are fed up with constant disregard for law and order. Largely Republican governments are going to begin offering ultimatums; they already have in some places.It will be interesting to watch the choices being made. Liberals have spent 3 solid months protesting and eroding American strength. Their childish denials are worn out and yet they cling to them stubbornly.Too many years of watching leaders such as Obama, Pelosi, Reid, and Warren have contributed to the idea that Democrats have carte blanche. It is going to be an unpleasant day when they realize that era is over.Share:








The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice are cracking down on H1-B Visa fraud and abuse.The immigration problem is multi-faceted. President Trump has put a tremendous focus on illegal immigration, rightfully so, but the legal immigration system is in need of reform. One problem with legal immigration that has received a considerable amount of attention from American patriots is the H1-B visa program. This visa has nothing to do with people coming into the country to settle long term, but is used by companies to bring in laborers, and the question is why thousands of workers are being brought in on these visas every year when so many Americans need jobs.Thousands of H1-B workers come from countries such as India and Pakistan every year.As we have covered here before at Conservative Daily Post, the H1-B system is rife with fraud and abuse. The Trump administration is now making concrete moves to crack down on the problem with three recent actions.AdvertisementOn Monday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security, issued a memo announcing “multiple measures to further deter and detect H-1B visa fraud and abuse.” The memo states that visas should continue to be available for “highly-skilled foreign nationals when there is a shortage of qualified workers in the country,” but it acknowledges that “too many American workers who are as qualified, willing, and deserving to work in these fields have been ignored or unfairly disadvantaged.” In short, the H1-B visa system will remain in place for now, but it is going to be reformed to cut down on practices that harm the American worker.The agency will begin making on-site visits to businesses that it has identified as having a high likelihood for ongoing H1-B fraud and abuse. These include businesses that lack basic publicly available information, depend on H1-B workers for a large portion of their workforce, or are requesting H1-B workers for work at off-site locations. Each of these characteristics is a red flag for possible fraud or abuse of the system.The agency will conduct “random and unannounced visits nationwide.” One can imagine that business owners who have been profiting off the abuse of the system are sweating bullets and scrambling right now. The memo notes that these on-site raids will not target legal employees in any way, only employers who could be abusing the system.The memo states that employers have an obligation to make a “good faith effort to recruit U.S. workers” before turning to foreign labor. The agency has also established an e-mail address ([email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */) for anyone to send tips on employers in need of a random inspection. The memo also states that the agency has been visiting work sites to check for fraud since 2009, so these new policies and procedures are more of an amplification of already existing protocol than an entirely new practice.AdvertisementThere is a great deal of resistance from tech companies against Trump’s campaign pledges to reduce the H1-B visa program. These companies insist that they depend on H1-B visa workers and that any reduction would hurt their business. There have been suggestions of reform, however, that would improve the system without destroying it. One such suggestion is to allow those who come in on the visas to leave the companies they start with and get higher paying jobs. As it stands now, the workers are tied to the companies that bring them in, essentially making them indentured workers who can only remain in the company if they keep the same low paying jobs.Fixing the H1-B Visa problem is of the essence of the MAGA program.The problem with allowing workers to stay in the country and find work at any company is that it becomes another yet another pathway to long term immigration and still increases competition with U.S. workers at higher wages. Competition is of course an essential part of a free economy, but an important aspect of the new “Trumpism” is that the needs of the nation as a whole sometimes come before the profit bottom line.In conjunction with the statement from the USCIS, Tom Wheeler, acting Assistant Director of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice also issued a statement on the matter. “The Justice Department will not tolerate employers misusing the H-1B visa process to discriminate against U.S. workers,” the Director said. The Justice Department statement on its website warns “employers petitioning for H-1B visas not to discriminate against U.S. workers.”AdvertisementThe Justice Department cited the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act as prohibiting discrimination against U.S. workers in hiring or firing.Attorney General Jeff Sessions has long been one of the only high level politicians talking about problems with legal immigration. Now he is one of the most powerful men in the country.In a high-profile story of 2016, hundreds of American computer programmers at Disney were forced to train their replacements, who had been brought in to work at lower wages. This was a blatant case of discrimination against American workers purely driven by considerations of profit. One of the disadvantaged workers spoke out, saying, “They all claim to come in on this visa because they are better than Americans, yet they come in on the lowest pay scales.” Another Disney worker said, “It was so humiliating to train somebody else to take over your job. I still can’t grasp it.”This week’s announcement was not the only action by the administration on this issue. Last month, the administration suspended the issuance of expedited H1-B visas for those who pay more. The expedition process allowed workers’ visas to be approved in as short a time as 15 days, rather than a few months. The suspension will last for up to six months while the program is reviewed. The suspension will be waived for workers with special considerations such as “humanitarian reasons, an emergency situation or the prospect of severe financial loss to a company or individual.”These actions by the Trump administration should ease the concerns of supporters who were growing impatient waiting for steps to be taken to reform the H1-B visa program. However, these measures will surely not be enough for those Trump supporters who want the program to be ended entirely. There are those who would rather see every single one of these jobs go to Americans. While no doubt there are cases when it makes sense to bring in foreign labor, provisions should be made for training and placing capable Americans in high level tech jobs. Considering so many of the original great tech companies began in America, there is no reason we shouldn’t be able to dominate the tech world again in every way.Share:








Trump has announced he will pull more than $32M from a United Nations humanitarian program, because they participate in China’s forced family planning policies.Enacting a Reagan era law, the Trump administration announced they would pull more than $32 million from a UN humanitarian agency that is protecting abortion.The move was in agreement with the Mexico City Policy, which was passed in 1985. It stipulates that for an overseas humanitarian organization to receive funds from the United States government, they may not, “perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.”Since the policy’s inception, various presidential administration have either rescinded or reinstated the policy, depending on their views. Among President Trump’s first acts in office was to issue a presidential memorandum on January 23, reinstating the policy.AdvertisementThe agency is the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF). They work in underdeveloped countries to help women and girls have access to safe childbirth and family planning services and to fight against inhumane treatments like female genital mutilation. But, research from the State Department shows the organization works in conjunction with the Chinese government, promoting their aggressive two-child policy. China’s mandate has been accused of causing involuntary sterilization and mandatory abortions, which both Democrats and Republicans are against.China had loosened its decades old one-child policy for a while, but in 2016, officially changed the law to two-children. This was in response to concerns about the aging population and the lack of workers to replace them.Even though the law has been altered, it doesn’t vary much. Women will still need to have a permit to have a child at all. If the pregnancy is not approved by the state, she will be subject to coerced or even forced abortion. Third children usually result in the same “mandatory abortion,” or heavy financial penalties—a figure that can amount to close to $40,000, when the average Chinese family in urban areas makes around $2,600 USD annually. That’s not to mention the cost of raising the child. Further, children conceived out of wedlock are still illegal and are forcibly aborted, even if police force has to be used.China’s family planning policies force unwed mothers to abort their children, even when the pregnancy is wanted.AdvertisementWhile the Mexico City Policy prohibits U.S. funding of abortions overseas, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, also enacted in 1985, applies to coerced or forced abortions or involuntary sterilization. In the same way, the United States government cannot fund foreign organizations that participate in these activities.In 2002, President Bush flagged the UNFPA, under the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, for its involvement in Chinese family planning.  He withheld funding from the organization from 2002 to 2008. Obama reinstated their funds in 2009. They have received around $32 million dollars per year since then.Obama refunded the UNFPA almost immediately after taking office, after President Bush had defunded the organization for the same reasons Trump is citing.Trump announced this week that he would be cutting that funding, due to their continued involvement in China. The organization however, says that it does not support the Chinese practice of forced abortions. In a statement released Tuesday, the organization wrote that they regret the U.S. decision to withhold founding.Advertisement“This decision is based on the erroneous claim that UNFPA ‘supports, or participates in the management of, a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization’ in China. UNFPA refutes this claim, as all of its work promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination. Indeed, United Nations Member States have long described UNFPA’s work in China as a force for good,” the statement reads.The organization claims that the support of the United States government and its people has enabled them to save the lives of tens of thousands of women and girls around the world from childbirths with disabilities and preventable diseases.“With previous United States contributions, UNFPA was combatting gender-based violence and reducing the scourge of maternal deaths in the world’s most fragile settings, in areas of conflict and natural disasters,” the statement continues.Later this week, Trump will be meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago. The meeting will address diplomatic relations between the two countries and strained trade relations. Trump has already traversed into some murky water with the president in regards to their “One China Policy,” and China’s military expansion in the South China Sea.It is unclear if the subject of UNPF funding, or human rights concerns over the two-child policy will come up, but Trump has already said the meeting will not be easy.“The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits,” Trump tweeted last week.The UNPF is not the only one to lose out in the new budget. The administration has cut a third of the State Department budget, much of it from global aid and humanitarian organizations. Rumors have even circulated that the administration may be defunding the United Nations entirely. But for now, pulling out of the UNPF is going to be a difficult enough public relations battle.Share:








At Least One Democrat Is Concerned At How The Confirmation Hearing Of Judge Neil Gorsuch (Pictured) Will Affect The Future.One of the duties of the President is to appoint judges to different positions. The most famous judges that are appointed happen to go to the Supreme Court. These appointments are for life, which means that the judges stay on the bench for the rest of their lives, barring impeachment or retirement.Right now, there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court Bench due to the unfortunate death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. President Donald Trump has made his appointment in the form of Judge Neil Gorsuch. Now the President appoints potential judges, but it’s up to the Senate to confirm them.There is a 60-vote threshold that needs to be broken in order for a confirmation to go through successfully. The Republicans control 52 seats in the Senate. In other words, the Democrats have enough people to stop the confirmation if they choose. Various Democrats have spoken publicly about opposing Gorsuch, but their private opinions are much different.AdvertisementOne of the anti-Gorsuch Senators, Claire McCaskill (D-MO), was speaking to donors at a private fundraiser when she made these comments. She said that she was okay with voting against him, but worried that the strategy to deny the confirmation would backfire in the long run.The leaked audio revealed that she was sympathetic to liberals who were angry at how former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, was treated. She also listed some reasons on why McCaskill would be okay with voting against Judge Gorsuch.Democrats Are Still Angry At How Former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court Nominee Was Treated.Specifically, she pointed to his opinion on supporting a company that had fired a trucker for leaving his cargo following a break down of his trailer in below-freezing temperatures. She also pointed to decision he gave that had him siding with a Colorado school district over parents of an autistic child regarding education.AdvertisementWhile she had those reasons, she also pointed to the fact that just denying Gorsuch for revenge would hurt the Democrats in the long run. “There is enough in his record that gives me pause. So I am very comfortable voting against him, but I’m very uncomfortable being part of a strategy that’s going to open up the Supreme Court to a complete change.”Senator McCaskill’s worry is directly related to the “nuclear option” that was implemented by Democrats several years ago. This change allowed a simple majority to confirm appointments through the Senate rather than having a 60-vote threshold. This change was highly touted by the Democrats at the time, but now they don’t like it because Republicans are using it.As of right now, the GOP doesn’t have the necessary votes to appoint Gorsuch, as there are not enough moderate Democrats saying they will support the Judge. The GOP needs at least eight Democrats to support Gorsuch if they are going to approve him. So far, there have only been three that have said they would support him.Senator McCaskill has pondered what would happen if Gorsuch’s nomination were halted.Advertisement“Let’s assume for the purposes of this discussion that we turn down Gorsuch, that there are not eight Democrats that vote to confirm him and therefore there’s not enough to put him on the Supreme Court. What then? So they move it to 51 votes and they confirm either Gorsuch or they confirm the one after Gorsuch.”The Missouri Senator also warned about what would happen after the Gorsuch nomination. Remember, he is replacing the late Justice Scalia, who was a staunch conservative. According to McCaskill, the stakes are higher when the next Supreme Court seat is empty; especially if one of the court’s liberals is next to go.Senator McCaskill Warned About What Would Happen If The Nuclear Option Is Used.“God forbid, Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies. Or (Anthony) Kennedy retires. Or (Stephen_ Breyer has a stroke or is no longer able to serve. Then we’re not talking about Scalia for Scalia, which is what Gorsuch is, we’re talking about Scalia for somebody on the court who shares our values. And then all of a sudden the things I fought for, with scars on my back to show (for) it in this state, are in jeopardy.”According to McCaskill’s spokesman, John LaBombard, the Senator hasn’t decided yet on how she is going to vote. “This is just Claire giving an honest answer to a question, same as always. She was asked about the lay of the land with the Gorsuch nomination, and she gave her thoughts. She didn’t say how she was going to vote, because she hasn’t decided yet. But when she does, she’ll be fully candid with Missourians about what went into her decision, same as always.”AdvertisementHowever, her comments leave little to be imagined. She has already stated reasons on why she wouldn’t vote for him. Unless something changes her mind at the last second, it’s essentially guaranteed that McCaskill will not vote for the Judge.Not all Democrats have thought about what this means however. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is just doing whatever she can to stop something of President Trump’s from going through. She wanted to stop the Senate hearing of Gorsuch from going forward.Senator Warren (Pictured Speaking) Has Tried To Stop The Confirmation Process Before.What makes this more interesting is the fact that the Senate Democrats have already attempted to stop the nuclear option from being a viable option. Almost two weeks ago, the Democrats were having a public and private opinion. In public, they were adamantly against the Gorsuch nomination, but in private, they were looking for a deal to be made.Share this article to show that Senator McCaskill has revealed her true feelings on the stopping of a Gorsuch appointment. She hasn’t decided if she is going to vote for or against Gorsuch yet, but she is leery of the possible implications that it would hold in the future. In other words, the Democrats had better be careful, but knowing them, they aren’t going to be.Share:








Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner (pictured center) is being used to bring peace, help achieve fair trade deals, and to END ISIS for the world.During the campaign, Trump talked about peace (he may not have used the word “peace”) more than he talked about the wall, NAFTA, or even “Crooked Hilary.” Not one speech likely went by without him talking about a strong military that he would never have to use. Words like “won’t ever” and “never have to use it” are speech patterns found only in a man who is longing for peace and a break from our accepted state of perpetual warfare. Love him or hate him, if one is fair in analyzing Mr. Trump, everyone agrees that he wants for guns to be aimed at no one.Except ISIS.Donald Trump has said time and time again that he planned to put ISIS onto the dungheap of history just as soon as he adjusted the height on the White House’s desk chair. This he not only showed by keeping Obama’s planned attack in place (it was his first military act as President), but he has been working quietly – as not to tip off the enemy – on the problem of ISIS since day one. Now the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Jared Kushner is flying to Iraq and will hear a briefing on “Anti-ISIS Strategy.” Kushner is Trump’s son-in-law and also his Sr. Advisor. He arrived in Baghdad this morning with the President in what is being called “a surprise visit with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joseph Dunford.” They are meeting with “U.S. and Iraqi officials,” and are set to hear briefings on the battles against ISIS.AdvertisementWhile America strives for peace, with ISIS, we have “no choice.”While getting along with the in-laws to such a degree is the envy of many men, Kushner is only 36 years old and is called by the WSJ a “newcomer to foreign policy issues.” Then again, America wanted the swamp drained, not the swamp dwellers just washed off and put back into the bog. Those with years of experience have allowed ISIS to blossom like poison ivy all over the Middle East, so perhaps a fresh set of eyes is just what the U.S. needs more than someone like John Kerry getting the job. Just the same, Kushner needs to be on his A-game because the Department of Defense is drafting up plans for the Trump administration to destroy the radical Muslim caliphate even as we speak.The “First Son-in-Law” has already been used in very sensitive talks between Israel and the Palestinians, with Trump saying, “If you can’t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can.” Considering that the President prides himself on his judgment of character and skill, this the highest compliment imaginable. It is also a level of trust that must carry with it the weight of the very Earth itself. It is even said that he’s met “Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman during his meeting with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (James Mattis).” Therefore, his acceptance of his job’s importance seems fully understood.The media has told of Trump wanting a swift win. This has been the goal of every leader entangled in the Middle East for decades.AdvertisementAfter also being heavily relied upon for his skill in dealing with Mexico, Kushner now is clearly being used to help develop the tone of talks in the Middle East with regards to Iraq (and by proxy, Syria). Two weeks ago, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that he was given assurances by the President that the U.S. will ramp up support for his nation’s constant struggles with terrorists. The Prime Minister was in Washington only last month and said that he felt as though Trump was ready to get quite serious about obliterating ISIS.Defense Secretary Mattis has given Trump a loose strategy for leveling the sharia terror group, but specifics needs to be detailed into the plan. The main problem that has plagued every leader who attempts to fight in the Middle East is that, like the NAZI’ Army and the Vietcong, ISIS and terrorists hide in residential areas, churches, mosques, and hospitals ON PURPOSE. That way, when an army comes to end their evil reign, they have to slaughter families, weddings, etc. to accomplish the task. At that point, each president has had to ask themselves if it is better to kill 30 innocents to stop terrorists from getting entrenched and killing 300. That decision is the heaviest for any leader to make and it is made worse in America by the media. The MSM says, basically, that if a Democrat launches such a strike, all action taken was needed. If however, a GOP president did it, it was a war crime and an act of utter evil.Though all of the proof seems to prove Trump innocent, the Democrat’s stay with the lie, even badgering Kushner.One way to offset some of this (it does not do much if ISIS is in a daycare, for instance) is to put U.S. troops on the ground, but historically, that is disastrous. One of the things that crumbled the Soviet Union was getting tied up in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Israel has been dealing with this since their birth, and they are no closer now to seeing their troops come home than they were in 1950. Still, “I think anyone who’s involved in the discussion on where we go strategically—having good situational awareness about what’s happening tactically and hear it first-hand and unfiltered, how our advisers assess the Iraqi security forces, both the opportunities and the challenges—will feed into somebody’s strategic view,”  were the words of Gen. Dunford said to those with him as they flew on a military jet.AdvertisementCertainly with all of this on Kushner’s plate, one would think that the media would lay off the “Russia got Trump elected” nonsense long enough to root for America, but they have not. Trump is not venturing into controversial grounds when he talks about killing off every last member of the rapists in ISIS. Everyone wants them destroyed for the good of humanity and God’s very creation, so it is only a topic that lends itself to conflicts between the GOP and the Democrats in terms of how it is done. Considering that Trump just talked healthcare with Rand Paul (R-KY), a man who was as hard on Ryancare as the Dem’s were, if the left would offer help in place of condemnation, the President would likely lend his ear to them, too.If the left allows him to work, it is imagined that Jared Kushner could bring peace to areas that today see great strife.This is what Donald Trump meant when he asked if this kind of fake Russian news was going to keep happening when it came time for his transition to settle and his leadership to begin. That time is here, and our President deserves our confidence as he attempts to remedy the biggest, darkest promoters of evil in modern times. ISIS is the very face of inhumanity, and if the Democrats can not get past their pink hats long enough to assist in their defeat, then perhaps we know what side many of them are on.Share:








Kim Jong-un has seen a high ranking defector leave and to warn the world of his madness.Bad news is normal news for anyone that follows the headlines. Not a day goes by that something awful is not happening somewhere. More often than not, the names “Russia,” “China,” and “North Korea” are found in those grim headlines, but rarely is it this bad. Today we were greeted with the fact that China may intervene in the NK nuclear and rhetoric onslaught on the same day that a high-profile North Korean defector has stated that Kim Jong-un really is mad enough to use nuclear weapons. Any talk of stopping NK, even with China, could lead to a launch as soon as NK sees the boats land on the shore.Let us start with China.Donald Trump has said that the U.S.A. could “totally” take out North Korea if China fails to act, but that may not be needed. Though the bold proclamation came only days before NK’s puppeteer, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is set to meet the President at his Mar-a-Lago resort in south Florida, China seems to already be engaging the idea. While trade and the man-made islands in the South China Sea will be talked about, Trump has said that, “Yes, we will talk about North Korea.” This statement was told to the Financial Times and was meant for those in Pyongyang. It could not be expected that Trump would fail to address the nation that is threatening the U.S. with nuclear weapons and who seem to have cut the strings from the Chinese marionette paddles.AdvertisementWhile Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has already met with Xi, Trump is looking to make his personal thoughts known face to face. The President went on to say, “China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won’t. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don’t it won’t be good for anyone.” This was not said as a threat so much as a statement of fact. Trump is famous for not wanting war, but also famous for saying that nation’s that force us to act will see a war more terrible than they had ever expected. Consider that China is furious over our THADD anti-missile system sitting in South Korea. If Xi begins halting sea construction and stopping NK before the U.S. must do so, that would solve all of those problems at one time in the Orient.Sky News reports that Trump was asked what his plans are, and in true Trump fashion when dealing with such questions that require leverage, he said, “I’m not going to tell you.” He then continued,“You know, I am not the United States of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the Middle East,” again alluding to Obama’s failed approach to strikes there. It is also reported that the support that China gives to NK via economic and diplomatic actions is the lifeblood that sustains the reclusive nation, but Xi insists that Beijing has little say of them these days. Judging by how NK mocked China recently, unless it was staged for appearances sake, it may be a true statement. If so, with Kim Jong-un free from his leash, the world could be a very scary place.North Korea is said to be seeking nuclear weapons after seeing the U.S. topple Iraq and Libya.AdvertisementThe topic of North Korea is even trumping talks on tariffs, something that the President said could be talked about “Perhaps the next time we meet.” That may be due in part to the second major news item of the day from Asian lands: the fact that a defector from North Korea who held the status of North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom named Thae Yong Ho has said that Kim Jong-un would use nuclear weapons against the U.S. While absurd sounding, this is what was said by the diplomat who fled with his wife while in London, England, according to NBC News.It is said in the last 20 years, Thae Yong Ho is the highest profile defector to speak, something that makes his words of monumental importance. Those words are not uplifting, as he stated that Kim Jong-un is “desperate in maintaining his rule by relying on his [development of] nuclear weapons and ICBM.” “Desperate” men do things like Adolph Hitler did and start recruiting children and old men for battle. We are already seeing signs of extreme madness in NK with the leader killing his own uncle and shooting two separate people with battleship guns.China and the U.S. are to meet, with Pyongyang being a major topic of discussion, according to the White House.He goes on that, “Once he sees that there is any kind of sign of a tank or an imminent threat from America, then he would use his nuclear weapons with ICBM,” thus furthering the Hitler analogy. Just as Germany was allowed to burn before surrender, so it is that Kim Jong-un would incinerate his own people by exposing them to a U.S. counterstrike rather than face defeat. Yong Ho faces a life that will forever see him and his wife looking over their shoulder for North Korean assassins for fleeing once in London to South Korea.AdvertisementHe also says that, though he had no ties to NK’s weapons knowledge, the common talk among those in the know have lead him to believe that Kim Jong-un “has reached a very significant level of nuclear development.” NBC has reported that eight is the number of nuclear weapons that North Korea is thought to have, though no one knows if they can be attached to ICBM’s. There are no solid facts that disprove this notion, so the world at this point simply hopes. Many in the government feel that this milestone has already been reached and that upwards to 90% of America could be at risk of death even if NOT true.Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet has said, “They have the nuclear capability — they’ve demonstrated that. And then, where they’re going with the miniaturization of that, whether they can actually weaponize a missile, that’s what’s driving the current concern.” To assume that NK would spend such vast amounts of time and capital to neglect this funding, however, seems unlikely to most analysts.The brave defector goes on to say, “If Kim Jong Un has nuclear weapons and ICBMs, he can do anything. So, I think the world should be ready to deal with this kind of person.” With South Korea only fifty miles away, plus Kim Jong-un barely in power (as those of more sane minds try to dethrone him) and as the U.S. now fully at attention, who knows how quickly nukes could come out if America attacks? This is the question put forth by Adm. James Stavridis, an NBC News analyst and dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts.In North Korea, people like this are so starved that they are born deformed and in poor heath. This is due to the leadership and greed of Kim Jong-un.Thae Yong Ho also warns, “Kim Jong Un is a man who can do anything beyond the normal imagination.” He also said, “the final and the real solution to the North Korean nuclear issue is to eliminate Kim Jong Un from the post.” With all of these facts in mind, and since NK may attack with a nuclear attack as soon as any U.S. boots hit the ground there, China’s Xi may be an important ally for Trump to have.IT is said that NK is  “obsessed” with nukes ever since the backward nation saw how the U.S. meddled in Iraq and Libya. This is exactly what people such as Dr. Ron Paul warned about as “blowback” way back in 2008, oddly enough. Either way, since Thae Yong Ho leaving means that North Korea will kill, torture, imprison, and beat his family for his defection, (for THREE generations!) he deserves to be listened to. Few, if any, have even given SO MUCH just to be free and to warn the U.S.Share:








Women who came to the United States as refugees and then became naturalized citizens are emerging as critical connections to terrorism abroad.The imbalance of power between men and women within the Islamic community is usually significant. In an unusual trend, this is changing in regards to terrorist groups. In the last few years, a growing number of women have become key financial supporters of terror groups. This includes two naturalized American women that were recently sentenced to 12 years for their role in the “Group of Fifteen.” A Grand Jury would issue indictments for a total of 5 women for their financial supports of terrorist groups overseas.The “Group of Fifteen” was a code name for a worldwide network of women raising funds for terrorism. The group would include members from Sweden, Somalia, Kenya, Egypt, the Netherlands, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Within the United States, the women lived in Minnesota, Virginia, and Washington.In a press release dated March 31, 2017, the Justice Department confirmed the sentencing of two members of the group:Advertisement“Muna Osman Jama, 36, of Reston, Virginia, and Hinda Osman Dhirane, 46, of Kent, Washington, were sentenced today to 12 years and 11 years respectively. Jama and Dhirane were found guilty of conspiracy to provide material support to al-Shabaab, a foreign terrorist organization, and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization after a bench trial in front of U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga on Oct. 25, 2016.”The FBI arrested Jama and Dhirane on July 27, 2014. Three other members of the “Group of Fifteen” were also arrested, outside of the United States.The arrest of Jama and Dhirane would disband the “Group of Fifteen.” The two were responsible for organizing the initial group and maintaining the communication efforts. As organizers, Jama and Dhirane would establish a complex series of computer chat rooms and phone lines to track on-going fundraising.A courtroom sketch artist captured the testimony of the woman accused of supporting terrorism.AdvertisementA large part of the group centered on raising money and transferring donations to splinter terrorist groups in Somalia and Kenya. These groups would claim to be a part of al-Shabaab. The efforts in Somalia would be called the “Hargeisa side.” Activities in Kenya were labeled the “Nairobi side.”Funds being sent to the “Hargeisa side” directly supported al-Shabaab military movements in the Golis Mountains of Somalia.  They would pay for a safe house to store weapons and serve as a planning base for political attacks. Funds for the “Nairobi side” supported another safe house that was also a combat hospital.Much of the evidence gathered for the case centered around both online and telephone conversations. These surveillances showed a deeper connection to the terrorist group. Both Jama and Dhirane regularly received inside information about terrorist plots.The pair was also recorded sharing some shocking opinions about terrorist attacks in real-time. During one conversation, Jama and Dhirane appeared to celebrate the bloodshed and violence at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. The al-Shabaab killed 175 people during the attack.AdvertisementThe attack at the Westgate Mall by al-Shabaab would end in 175 dead.Dhirane would also talk to another conspirator about the Boston Marathon Bombings. She described the attack as a blessing from God and shared a laugh about the fear it garnered. Although the Boston attack was not tied directly to the al-Shabaab, they felt connected to the carnage caused by the bombings.The members of the “Group of Fifteen” did far more than just send wire transfers to fund al-Shabaab. They were tied in a much more significant way. Shockingly, this is not the first time naturalized American women in the United States have helped terrorist groups.In 2011, a judge convicted two Minnesota women of financially supporting the al-Shabaab as well. Amina Farah Ali and Hawo Mohamed Hassan faced a combination of 15 federal charges. Ali and Hassan collected money in the name of charity to fund al-Shabaab troops.Prosecutors described the Ali and Hassan crimes as:Advertisement“…the two women went door-to-door in the name of charity and held religious teleconferences to solicit donations, which they then routed to the fighters. The defendants said they believed the men were protecting their homeland from the Ethiopian army, which many saw as invaders.”The defense team, in this case, argued the women did not know about the connection to al-Shabaab. However, just as in the case of the “Group of Fifteen,” the pair received insider information about terrorist activities.Prosecutor Steven Ward described their connection to the terrorist group as:“…Ali and Hassan were in contact with key al-Shabaab leaders and getting frequent updates on the fighting. Their conversations showed they knew al-Shabaab was a terror group, sometimes celebrating casualties. In one of those calls, Ali told others to “forget about the other charities” and focus on “the jihad.” In another, she said, “Let the civilians die.”The women regularly received updates about terror attacks on local police.In an odd twist of fate, coming to the United States has changed how some Islamic women interact with the world around them. These women are assuming more leadership roles, but not in a positive way. They are working to support terrorist efforts; even as naturalized citizens, they have found joy in the pain of other Americans.It is becoming cleare that the face of terrorism is changing. We are no longer just looking for terrorists dressed in fatigues, fighting in far away places. They could also be the teenager next door, as in the case of Zakaryia Abdin, or the ladies you see in headscarves at the grocery store.When on American soil, the efforts of these terrorist supporters are not as dramatic as those fighting overseas. But they are an essential part of enabling those attacks to happen by sending financial support.Share:








Three Swedish police officers attempt to restrain Muslim migrant suspected of arson (pictured above).Cultures continue to clash as many refugees go to Europe in order to flee the violence raging through their home country. Unfortunately, many are failing to assimilate into the society of the country granting them protection. This addition to the population is causing altercations between police officers and refugees to increase in both frequency and severity. As a result, police are becoming less capable of enforcing the law. A recent example of this growing problem has been reported in Sweden. During what should have been a routine procedure, police officers ended up failing to detain a violent refugee. Despite their desperate attempts to restrain the suspect, which lasted several minutes, they failed and he was able to get away.A recently released cellphone video appears to show a Muslim refugee fighting off three female police officers at an asylum in Sweden. The video begins with the male refugee picking up scattered objects in an open courtyard. The camera then turns to the three officers watching off in the distance. The man proceeds to charge at the women, hurling debris at their car. He then lunged at one of the officers, narrowly missing her. AdvertisementA brave onlooker ran up from behind the violent suspect and managed to bring him to the ground. Two of the officers then pounced on him and attempted to restrain him with handcuffs. He struggled against both, forcing the third officer to intervene. Still, he managed to resist. A second onlooker rushed to help, grabbing the unnamed suspect by the neck. He managed to break free again and faced off against everyone. After dodging a couple of strikes, the suspect picked up nearby rocks and objects. He then started throwing them at the police car, shattering windows and denting the sides. After forcing the women to retreat, the attacker wandered off, disappearing into a nearby building.Twitter user PeterSweden shared part of the video on Twitter, sparking outrage. A full video of the encounter can be seen below (Warning, the video contains graphic content): Naturally, many clueless liberals may jump to conclusions and believe that the officers shown were harassing a poor, innocent minority. However, this particular individual was far from innocent. Apparently, they were investigating him for a series of arson attacks against the local community in the past few months. Despite being allowed safety in their country, this specific refugee decided that he only needed to obey the authority of police when he saw fit. AdvertisementAs Sweden continues to allow refugees to flood into their country, situations like this appear to become more widespread. Sweden has made headlines in the past as a result of their immigration problem. Many have spoken out against the country for allowing Muslim “no-go zones” to exist. The concern about these areas is extremely appropriate. In February, it was reported that Sweden had recently experienced a sharp rise in these areas. increasing to fifty-five. This is a direct consequence of immigration, resulting from the failure of particular newcomers to assimilate. Swedish law enforcement is becoming increasingly less capable of protecting the innocent.Police have repeatedly complained about how difficult it has been to monitor the areas. According to NRK, an officer reported that they were considering a career change, saying “we have a major crisis. Many colleagues are choosing to quit.”Swedish police.If police officers feel demoralized, or worse, if they quit, the risk only increases. Since many are already complaining about a lack of police presence, the consequences of this are extreme. It’s imperative that law enforcement officials feel like they are empowered by those they are protecting. Just like with a criminal, they should be considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Unfortunately, many on the left would rather unfairly believe officers are guilty until they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they’re innocent. AdvertisementSome have even claimed that there are people within these “particularly vulnerable areas” allegedly enforcing Sharia Law using “morality police.” These individuals roam the streets to ensure people are behaving in accordance with the Quran.Many liberal feminists have spoken out against this creeping oppression. The widely known feminist Nalin Pekgul, known for bringing attention to the risks women living in the suburbs face, has said she’s no longer venturing into certain areas of Sweden. “In Tensta I am a known face and I had no desire to stir up trouble when I get harassed,” she says. According to her, “religious fundamentalists gained increasing space in the area and the place of women in the public sphere diminished.”Nalin Pekgul, a renowned liberal feminist in Sweden.On top of that, last year, a Norwegian film crew was attacked by a group of Swedish locals while they were trying to interview Tino Sanandaji, a Swedish economist and author. As an outspoken critic of mass migration into Sweden, he’s made many enemies. A library even refused to stock his book, calling it racist. Many of the “no-go zones” are so dangerous that some refugees are allegedly considering returning back to their war-torn countries. According to an interview with NRK, Mohammed Dame, a Somali immigrant, claimed, “it’s like a war zone. We do not know who gets shot. Bullets can hit you anywhere,” adding, “now there are more weapons than ever. There are more drugs than ever. There is more insecurity. Everyone is afraid. I dare to say the truth, there are not many who dare it.”AdvertisementDame emphasized the psychological torment many living in the area experience, saying, “People are desperate and terrified. They think of their children. They get a stomach ache every time they swing into the parking lot where they live. We are at war, with weapons and gun and drug everywhere. They have taken over the block where I lived. It can not continue this here.” He concluded, “maybe I’ll move back. I do not know. But I will not be moving around in Sweden. I want to feel safe.” Muslims protestors burn a Swedish flag.Swedish officials have formally denied the existence of any such areas. Snopes and others have corroborated their statements. According to the fact-checking website, allegations that “no-go zones” exist in Sweden are “false.” Snopes’ poorly researched conclusion relies on the testimony of a single officer in Sweden. The officer, Johannes Schultz, arrogantly states, “I don’t believe that there are ‘no-go zones.’” However, he appears to mistakenly believe that the areas of concern are areas where police officers are somehow prohibited from going into. When many raise concerns about their local community, they’re referring to areas with high levels of crime that are so dangerous, cops are reluctant to enter. Schultz dismisses the notion of “no-go zones,” suggesting it’s an overreaction. Specifically, he says, “I can understand why people feel like that. Because when something happens here in Rosengård, that’s a big thing in the media. So people that are never here, they read that.” As an example, he says “maybe one year ago, three cars burned overnight in Rosengård and the same night one car burned in a pretty good area in Malmö. I couldn’t see one line in the newspaper about the other car. The next day the big news stations were all over it here in Rosengård.”The problems in Sweden are so awful, that even President Trump has spoken out against it. During a rally, he claimed, “We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany. You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?”In response, many migrants appeared to prove his point by taking to the streets of Sweden and rioting. But despite the violent outburst and mockery by many on the left, Trump’s tweet was based on actual reporting by Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. After being pressed, Trump clarified that his tweet was in indeed in reference to a segment done by Carlson’s show. At a rally, he further explained, saying “Sweden. They took in large numbers [of refugees],” adding, “They’re having problems like they never thought possible.” My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017Refusing to conform to a country’s hobbies and pastimes is possibly excusable. However, not abiding by the laws of the country is something that must not be tolerated. Other countries, including the United States, should learn from Sweden’s mistakes. Immigration must not be rushed and poorly thought through. Sweden proved that in order for the safety of those already living in the country, immigration must be gradual and controlled. Although fact-denying liberals are turning their backs to this information, determined to perpetuate ideas that have been proven failures, Trump thankfully recognizes the potential danger. Share:








High school student Evan Jimenez was assaulted by two members of the Rancho San Pedro gang, tag pictured on the right, while walking through an unincorporated area in Los Angeles County.On March 30, Evan Jimenez was walking home after a high school baseball game in San Pedro, California. Two men came from an alley in this unincorporated neighborhood and asked him what gang he was with. The fifteen-year-old replied that he wasn’t in a gang. These two men then proceeded to beat the young teen. First, they smashed him in the head with a liquor bottle. Then they attacked him with hands and feet, stomping the boy. Then, the men choked Jimenez until he was unconscious.Jimenez was found on the ground, beaten senseless, and taken to Harbor UCLA Medical Center.At the hospital, Jimenez’s trauma warranted a medically induced coma, which he has been in for three days. The doctors diagnosed Jimenez with brain swelling and fractures to his jaw and face. He is currently listed as being in stable but serious condition.AdvertisementEvan Jimenez in his hospital bed.The Jimenez family, which has been active on social media, said that in brief moments when Evan woke up, he literally kicked and punched and scratched, clearly still living in the moments of his assault.Where exactly did this assault take place? It took place in an area called La Rambla. If one searches for La Rambla on the internet, little will come up, except for the acknowledgment that it exists in L.A. County and that it does not participate in the census. This is not uncommon for Los Angeles.Los Angeles County, which is where San Pedro is located, is made up of 88 different incorporated cities. These each have their own city council, or an equivalent governing body, and they have their police forces. This already seems like a complicating factor in a variety of ways.AdvertisementHowever, it gets a worse. There are roughly 126 unincorporated areas that exist in Los Angeles County. They make up 65% of Los Angeles County. These areas have no police or government. This ambiguity means that departments don’t do crime prevention, as these areas are not their primary duty to patrol. They do investigate crimes or incidents that happen there..L.A. County Map: red signifies unincorporated areas.The Lomita Sheriff’s Department is tasked with responsibility for investigations in La Rambla. The sheriff’s deputies investigating this incident stated that they suspect the Rancho San Pedro gang. This is based on the fact that the gang has graffiti tagged many of the areas of La Rambla. The area is commonly known to be part of the gang’s territory. Considering this, and the random nature of the assault on Evan Jimenez, the sheriff’s department believes that this was part of a gang initiation.This assault brings to the forefront an issue facing Los Angeles and all major cities in the United States, which all identify as sanctuary cities; violent crime and gang activity amongst illegal aliens.AdvertisementAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, which is, for some reason, not allowed to compose a comprehensive list of the amount of illegal aliens, there are over 1 million illegal aliens in Los Angeles County. There is an estimated 3 million illegal aliens in all of California. This is based on census data – as is the approximation that 11 million illegal aliens live in the country.The clear problem is that some of these unincorporated areas, like La Rambla, are not taken into the census count. Moreover, in the areas that are counted, they assume that 100% of the illegal alien population is responding to census requests. Based on common sense, one can see that these numbers are flawed. There is no explanation at to why the DHS isn’t tasked with compiling a comprehensive list of illegal aliens’ presence and residence in the country. So, the number of 1 million is a conservative estimate.Population statistics are not only area where shady data propagates a narrative that is far from truth. In 2015, it was found that the LAPD was under-reporting violent crimes. Assault cases were reported as minor incidents. LAPD underreported 14,000 assault cases over the course of 8 years. This meant that L.A. was reporting data that indicated that the city was much safer than reality. Liberals picked up on this of course, advertising that crime was down.Never-Trumpers in L.A. where over one million illegal aliens live.Liberals and Hillary Clinton even pushed this idea during the 2016 election: that cities in the United States were safer than ever. They supported their statements by using national data, which is skewed by places like Idaho and Montana. In reality, violent crime is up in every major city. Chicago is the example that immediately comes to mind, with multiple shootings every day and a death toll that outpaces some war zones. Chicago is not the only one.AdvertisementLos Angeles Police Department reports that from 2015 to 2016 robberies are up 13%, aggravated assaults are up 10%, and homicides are up 5%. Overall violent crime was up by 10% over the last year and up 38% over two years. Now this data is disconcerting, but there is an even more fatal piece of information. LAPD estimates, as of 2007 (the most recent available data), that there are 120,000 gang members in Los Angeles. Most of these gangs are Latino and many of the members are illegal aliens living in unincorporated areas in Los Angeles County.Los Angeles is a sanctuary city and California is attempting to become a sanctuary state. This means that they will not enforce federal immigration law. L.A. will not comply with ICE or any other federal agency in regards to the deportation of illegal aliens. In fact, they will openly resist and impede deportation. The authorities in California, and the left, generally argue that these illegal aliens are being demonized, they are just like every other American, and they are being persecuted.The open resistance from California is done to protect illegal aliens and happens at the expense of American citizens like Evan Jimenez. How many American citizens have to be casualties to this policy of non-enforcement before lawmakers decide to do their jobs?Evan Jimenez has a GoFundMe where people can donate to cover the costs of his hospital bills and recovery costs.Share:








More than 100 previously deported sex offenders have been arrested at the Rio Grande Valley sector of the border since October 2016.Another story from the southern border shows yet again the truth of one of Donald Trump’s controversial claims. Quite often, when the media really goes after Trump over some statement, that’s just a sign it contains an important truth.Along the Rio Grande Valley sector of the border, during the fiscal year 2017, which began in October 2016, more than 100 previously deported sex offenders have been arrested attempting illegal re-entry into the United States from Mexico. In the same area and time period, 1,100 aliens have been arrested attempting to enter. Last Wednesday, two sex offenders were arrested at two different points in this border region on the same day.Last Wednesday, the Mobile Response Team working in Brooks County caught a Mexican national attempting to enter the United States illegally. After taking the suspect to the station, agents found the suspect had a criminal history that includes a 2007 charge for Aggravated Sexual Assault, according to a statement by Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marlene Castro. He is being charged with illegal re-entry after having been previously deported for his sexual assault.AdvertisementOne hour later, Border Patrol agents near Sullivan City, Texas arrested a Guatemalan man with a criminal history that includes a charge of Aggravated Sexual Battery in 2007.Both of these arrests occurred in the Rio Grande Valley area. Below is a map showing this region, highlighted in red.The Rio Grande Valley, where the arrests took place, is just one small portion of the border.This is of course occurring all along the border, all the time.AdvertisementLook at how small the Rio Grande Valley sector is relative to the entire border. Just in that one tiny area, in a few months’ time, 100 previously deported sex offenders were caught coming from Mexico. Consider how many illegals may have eluded capture, and how many could be entering across the entire border.There are hordes of rapists and sex offenders crossing our border on a regular basis. Even after the election of Trump, when all would-be illegals know they will face stronger enforcement, confirmed criminals continue to pour in. The border is under siege. The good news is Border Patrol is hiring.This is a real sign in Arizona, one of the states most besieged by illegal aliens.It really cannot be said enough until the day that it is finally done. We need to build a wall. Furthermore, once that wall is built, we must guard it with unceasing vigilance. As the saying goes, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.”AdvertisementIt is actually a fact that Hispanics are raping children on a regular basis in the United States. For context, consider that this problem is rampant in certain cultures, which have not developed the same standards that we in the West have. Presumably, the majority of these crimes are taking place within their own communities in the United States, but that is no reason to tolerate it. North Carolinians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement have compiled extensive data on arrests of illegal aliens in North Carolina for indecent acts with children. Here are some samples from the collected data.In North Carolina, in January 2017, there were 19 illegal aliens arrested for 37 child sex crimes.In January, 21 illegals were arrested for 49 child sex crimes.In December 2016, 18 illegals were arrested for 48 sex crimes against children.In November 2016, 16 illegals were arrested for 82 crimes against children.AdvertisementGoing back further to December 2013, 89 individuals were arrested for 575 charges of sex crimes against children.And remember, liberals want these people to be in the country. They want to make their cities “sanctuaries” to draw these illegals to them, to protect these people, and to fight the lawful authority of the federal government to deport them.It’s obvious that the government and the big media companies are hiding the facts from the public and giving false information about immigrant crime. The media will run countless stories about how the West is guilty of “rape culture,” pointing to silly subliminal messages and faked research. Meanwhile, they promote the importation of a real rape culture from outside our borders.“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”With these simple words, Donald Trump set the world on fire.This is of course an excerpt from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign announcement speech. The media and establishment flipped out that someone famous would say such an outrageous thing. And of course the media proceeded to lie, to call Trump a liar or crazy, and to distort his words.The media told the public that Trump called all Mexicans rapists, which is of course not what he said. He was talking about illegal immigrants. He said a subset of those people are rapists, and another subset are presumably good people.And he actually based his claim on a factual report by Fusion showing 80% of women crossing the border get raped by the human smugglers while in transit.Everybody remembers and loves this classic.But what was so game-changing about this episode was the way Trump refused to back down even an inch. We live in a culture where celebrities regularly make mildly outrageous statements that violate some taboo. The media then comes down on them, and the offender issues a forced apology, as if they didn’t mean what they said. Trump didn’t just buck this nonsense. He made an art out of triggering the media into a frenzy and then using that energy to propel himself forward. Trump’s decades of experience with the media, his hard nosed experience in the cutthroat world of New York real estate, and his uncontrollable alpha personality make him the perfect person to destroy this culture of weak submission before the media. His remarkable resolve in the face of such bullying endeared him to millions of Americans.Share:








CAIR is confident that they will be listened to.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has been the subject of questions and accusations regarding their link to violent groups. The increase in terror activity has meant even more attention on this organization with their sketchy history and suspect affiliations. CAIR’s new demand to President Trump has highlighted the status they believe they should be afforded.CAIR was founded in 1994 and boasts a “successful track record in its defense of civil liberties and tolerance.” Outside opponents might not be so quick to agree. It has repeatedly been shown that CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are closely connected. As of 2015, the Brotherhood has been named a terrorist organization by the governments of Bahrain, Egypt, Russia, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Pressure has been building for President Trump to do the same in the United States.According to the Investigative Project on Terrorism, since 2007, CAIR has been repeatedly tied to Hamas and other terrorist activities. AdvertisementIn 2004, Yassin Aref was indicted after a year-long undercover investigation. The New York imam (Muslim holy leader) had taken part in a plan to purchase shoulder-fired missiles. In addition, he was helping to plot the assassination of the Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations. Fortunately, the whole plan was part of the sting.CAIR issued blanket, every Muslim is innocent-type statements.“All too often, these types of cases are used by those with political or religious agendas to smear Muslims and to demonize Islam. We should stick to the facts of the case and avoid generalizations and stereotypes that only serve to create societal divisions and promote anti-Muslim bigotry.”In addition, CAIR accused the government of conspiring to target Muslims, saying, “It’s a perplexing case, and the question we have is whether the government got these men to do something they otherwise wouldn’t have done.”  The only truly baffling statement is CAIR’s behavior. After Aref was convicted the group continued their defense.AdvertisementThey called the sentencing “draconian,” and “call[ed] on Congress to conduct hearings into the selective prosecution of Muslims since the 9/11 terror attacks.”Obama’s repeated concessions to groups like CAIR left Americans questioning his motives.2005 saw the case of Dr. Rafiq Sabir and CAIR rushing to his defense. Sabir and his accomplice were charged with providing support to al-Qaeda. The prosecution had video evidence of the man pledging his allegiance to the terror group. He ended up being convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.During his trial, the executive director of CAIR in Pembroke Pines, Florida told reporters;Advertisement“We’ve seen cases where Muslims are charged for XYZ and then cleared of the charges, so we need to make sure that all the facts are revealed. Muslims, in general, in America are still facing a lot of adversity…” CAIR has yet to make any further statements since Sabir’s conviction. In 2007, CAIR was named as a co-conspirator in a trial of five members of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (HLF). Serving as Hamas’ main fundraiser in the United States, HLF has even released videos celebrating terrorist attacks and showing training.Although unindicted, CAIR could not remove themselves completely from the messy details of that trial. The HLF members were standing trial for providing support to Hamas in the amount of at least $12 million.The 118-page investigation report by IPT reveals many more CAIR connections to, and condonation of, terrorist activities. Their claimed innocence appears to be little more than window dressing.AdvertisementDuring Obama’s presidency, CAIR enjoyed the perk of having his ear. His leniency, bordering on submission, to terrorist-tied organizations like CAIR, was disturbing to many. Multiple times over eight years, Obama met with top CAIR officials. He certainly wasn’t discussing their questionable loyalties, or his own.A recent demand from CAIR demonstrates how comfortable they have become with being in charge. They have demanded that Patrick Dunleavy, an instructor in the Air Force on counter-terrorism, be dismissed from his position.This is not the first time that CAIR has made, and accomplished, such bold requests. In one instance, the FBI was forced to get rid of training materials that CAIR deemed “offensive to Muslims.” However, this is the first time they organization has attempted the move with the new administration.Dunleavy is one of the military’s top instructors at the U.S. Air Force Special Operations School (USAFSOS) in Florida. His course, entitled “The Dynamics of International Terrorism,” provides “awareness and appreciation of the organization, motivation, operational capabilities and threat posed by terrorists on an international, national, and regional basis.”The program is designed for personnel with no prior anti-terrorism training. It is primarily focused on teaching measures to protect military members and their families by minimizing threats.Dunleavy is an experienced teacher. Before taking his current position he was the deputy inspector general for the New York State Department of Corrections. In that post he testified to Congress regarding the threat of Islamic radicalization in U.S. prisons.Patrick Dunleavy (left) and Stephen Emerson (right) are both anti-terrorism activists.Additionally, Dunleavy is a senior fellow at a non-profit think tank called Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT), the same group that did the report on CAIR. Operating for decades, they “investigate the operations, funding, activities, and front groups of Islamic extremists. It is this capacity that causes problems for CAIR. It is unclear if they object to Dunleavy himself or IPT as a whole.CAIR calls the research organizations an “anti-Muslim propaganda mouthpiece.” They claim that the IPT “has made a number of false statements betraying a personal prejudice against Islam and Muslims.”Furthermore, CAIR states that the founder of IPT, Steven Emerson, has made “Islamophobic” statements about terrorist attacks. They offer little proof of their broad accusations, following standard operating procedure for them. In their view, any statement that is negative towards Muslims, is biased.Verification is not needed if a group has enough power. A reminder of their strength was included in a letter to Lieutenant General Webb about Dunleavy;“As you may recall in 2012, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey ordered the U.S. military to ‘scour its training material to ensure it doesn’t contain anti-Islamic content.”If the past two months are any indication, CAIR is about to get a rude awakening. President Trump has proven that he does not cave to pressure. A group with such close ties to terrorism is unlikely to encourage the president to change that stance.We hope that President Trump sends a strong statement to CAIR, one that will likely carry across the ocean to their terrorist allies; America will no longer cave to intimidation.

Senator Warren speaks loudly against wage gaps, she doesn’t act.“I honestly can’t believe that we are still arguing for equal pay in 2014.” Elizabeth Warren, the well-known Democratic senator from Massachusetts, began a speech to her fellow senators with those words. Given on April 8, 2014, Warren was addressing the day designated as “Equal Pay Day.”The day was created by the National Committee on Pay Equity twenty years ago. Each year, the Census Bureau’s unadjusted gender pay gap numbers are used to “determine how far into the next year women would have to work to match annual earnings of men.”Feminists have seized the issue of equal pay with the fervor of rabid dogs. It is a favorite topic of female lawmakers because they know they can bank on women’s agreement and men’s guilt. Warren is never afraid to take advantage of any leverage possible.Advertisement“In 99.6% of all occupations, men get paid more than women…that’s not an accident, that’s discrimination.”Surely to the dismay of all liberals, last year’s report shows that women only earned 79.6% of what men earned. This put Equal Pay Day today, April 4, 2017. However, that is a slight increase over 2015. Two years ago, women were making 78.6% of men’s wages, giving them earnings of $40,742 compared to men’s $51,212.AdvertisementShe has already made her ferverent speech for this recent war on women. A new report by the Washington Free Beacon shows that Elizabeth Warren should have avoided commenting this year.Today is #EqualPayDay – and I cannot believe I have to give another speech fighting for equal pay for equal work for women.— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) April 12, 2016AdvertisementAn analysis of Senator Warren’s staff reveals that the wage gap between her male and female employees is larger than the national average. Women on her staff only made 71 cents for every dollar made by male staffers. This makes her statement today look even worse; “In the year 2016, at a time with self-driving cars and computers that sit on your wrist, women still make only 79 cents for every dollar a man makes.”The median annual earnings shows the sharp reality of the pay received by Warren’s staff. Women working for the liberal senator made $52,750 on average. That is a shocking $20,000 less than the men earning $73,750.Using average salaries instead of a median, the pay gap spikes to just over $26,000. Senator Warren has said the wage gap is “a problem, a big problem.” Why is this egregious problem even larger in her own office?In 2016, Warren employed only one full-time female employee that made a six-figure salary. That honor went to her director of scheduling, she earned $100,624.88. In contrast, five full-time male employees hit the mark;Director of oversight and investigations – $156,000AdvertisementLegislative director – $149,458Deputy chief of staff – $119,375Massachusetts state director – $152,310Deputy state director – $113,750All these men earned more than Warren’s highest paid female staffer. There are arguments that attempt to explain the wage gap, offering contributing factors that can affect salaries. The senator does not allow for those arguments, at least in her lectures. She claims that the American workplace is “rigged against women.” In her speech, she railed against the injustice;
“Today is Equal Pay Day, and by the sound of it, you would think it’s some sort of historic holiday commemorating the anniversary of a landmark day that our country guaranteed equal pay for women. But that’s not what this is about. Not even close.”#EqualPayDay isn’t a national day of celebration. It’s a national day of embarrassment.— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) April 12, 2016This time, Elizabeth Warren has truly made history. The last time the national wage gap was as wide as it was in her office in 2016 was in the year 1995. Warren’s office sends women more than 20 years into the past. How can she speak about a rigged system?Warren is in good, or at least famous company, though. On the list of politicians who pay women less than men, Hillary Clinton rests firmly.Clinton has been consistent. The wage gap began when she was a New York senator and continued into her position as secretary of state. In what was viewed as a liability by some on her team, the gap existed even as she ran for as presidential candidate for women of AmericaLiberal hypocrisy also clouded Obama’s statements about the unfair practice of paying men more. Women at the White House were paid less than their counterparts.Louisiana Democratic Governor, Jon Bel Edwards pays women staff less. Last month, he was the host of an “equal pay summit.” Andrew Cuomo signed two orders recently to eliminate the wage gap in his state. He should probably start with his own employees.This makes Senator Warren’s other comments, that fault lies with the GOP, comedic. “Heck, they’d rather spend their time trying to defund Planned Parenthood health clinics and cut women’s access to birth control than do anything — anything at all — to give working women a raise,” she said.Senator Warren’s office did not respond to inquiries about the wage issue. The debate over equal pay is far from over. There are too many factors to provide a simple answer. While the issue is not settled, Warren and her liberal friends should realize that their arguments would be far more convincing if they bothered to put it into practice themselves.Share:








Youth Services of Tulsa hosts sex education workshops at local schools.Liberal educators continue to encroach upon parent’s rights. An Oklahoma mother was infuriated after her daughter’s school whisked the 16-year-old to a Tulsa clinic and implanted a birth control device into her arm. Miracle Foster was duped into believing that her child was going on a fun, educational trip. She was never informed that her daughter was instead undergoing an invasive medical procedure until the girl was already home. “Had I known that this field trip was for her to get that done, I would not have allowed her to go,” Foster told KOKI-TV. “I just did not expect this…My child went on a field trip, and she came back with this in her arm.” AdvertisementPublic schools in America are abysmal. There are a few exceptions scattered throughout the country but, by and large, school districts in the U.S. are failing to give students an adequate education. Homeschooling is so impractical that families are forced to entrust their children to the government. Langston Hughes Academy for Arts & Technology, where Foster’s daughter is enrolled, hosts an annual sex education workshop for students. This year students had so many questions that administrators teamed up with Youth Services of Tulsa to organize a school trip to the clinic. Once there, Foster’s daughter was given the implant.Miracle Foster was outraged when she learned what happened to her daughter.The device lasts for three years. It’s hormonal birth control, which means that many women experience side-effects. It’s impossible for doctors to predict how every woman’s body will react. Millions of women use Norplant without problem, but nay are not so lucky. AdvertisementTitle X federal guidelines state that children as young as twelve can receive contraception without parental consent. We don’t allow minors to drink and they can’t vote. Yet they’re allowed to decide their own medical care? A twelve-year-old child cannot legally have sex with anyone. So why should he or she be allowed to take birth-control without a parent’s knowledge?After the media latched onto Foster’s story, the principal of Langston Hughes Academy released the following statement: “This was not a field trip. Youth Services of Tulsa does an annual in-service on Sex Education. They offer students an opportunity to contact them on their own for more information. The parent gave her child permission to leave the school. Under Title X, once young people are at the clinic and are of reproductive age, they can make decisions on their own without parental consent. As you can understand this situation involves a minor and we do not release information about students. Nevertheless, the student was well within their rights of Title X which is a federal guideline that provides reduced cost family planning services to persons of all reproductive age.”If the school isn’t guilty of breaking the law, it’s only a sign that our laws are too lenient. School nurses usually have to obtain parental consent to administer aspirin. Yet Youth Services of Tulsa is obviously free to perform any number of procedures on students.AdvertisementLangston Hughes Academy for Arts & Technology shipped students to a sexual education clinic.It doesn’t matter what you think about birth control; this story is about individual rights as a parent. School administrators shouldn’t be involved in a girl’s decision to go on birth control. The only opinions that she should care about, beyond her own, are her doctor’s, and yes, her parent’s. Langston Hughes Academy’s website claims that the school’s mission is to “enhance the development of at-risk students in grades 9-12 through graduation and acceptance into college or career technical institutions.”Alienating a girl from her parents hardly constitutes a good way to improve her life. Perhaps Foster had already decided that she wanted her child to get the implant. Maybe she had already made an appointment. It doesn’t matter. What the school did would still be considered despicable. Administrators and teachers took on the role of parent and guardian to Foster’s child. They had no idea what she desired for her daughter, yet that didn’t stop them from embedding a medical device into the girl’s arm. “I just feel like my rights as a parent were violated,” Foster told KOKI-TV.AdvertisementFoster believes that she should have been the one to talk to her child about birth controlHer rights were violated. Her child underwent an invasive procedure without her consent. If the girl had chosen to keep her adventure to herself rather than come clean, Foster would have had little chance of ever finding out what happened. She didn’t even get the courtesy of a nurse or doctor informing her of the potential risks that her daughter was now exposed to. Youth Services of Tulsa has been in partnership with local school districts for the past four years. Parents have complained about the group’s methods before this latest incident. It’s unlikely however that Tulsa officials will end the relationship anytime soon. The liberal grip on education is so tight that even red states are in their control.Share:








Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other GOP members are ready to go “nuclear” over Judge Gorsuch and Democratic opposition.Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch, has faced every pointed and rudely intended question imaginable by people like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). They have asked him how he may rule on cases that have not yet been heard, something that other judges in his shoes have declined to comment on. This is true on both sides of the aisle. For that matter, Gorsuch is really not that conservative, as seen by his apparent stance on the “settled law” of gay marriage. Democratic opposition to the moderate Judge has lead Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to declare that there is “no other choice” but to employ what Breitbart News calls “the nuclear option.” Simply put, that means diminishing the “60-vote filibuster threshold for a Supreme Court nominee to a simple majority.”A reporter asked, “Mitch McConnell, the leader is prepared to go nuclear here,” to which the Senator replied, “Yeah. We have no other choice. We’re not going to have a tradition of the senate where they get their judges and President Trump can’t get his.” Not only is this showing that some roads have been paved since the campaign days that saw Trump giving out Graham’s personal number to everyone but the bathroom wall, but also that there is a moral question at play here. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was President Bill Clinton’s pick, a hardline liberal who was the head of the leftist ACLU. While this fact was a malady to the health of conservative ideals, her credentials – though not her judgment – spoke boldly in her favor. Quite frankly, she was qualified, even if the right detested her.Judge Neil Gorsuch is Trump’s choice to replace Justice Scalia.AdvertisementFast forward to the presidency of George W. Bush and his pick for the Supreme Court, Harriet Miers. Here is a judge that was savaged. Nowhere to be found were the voices on the left supporting a “powerful woman.” Instead, she had her qualifications assaulted to such a degree that she decided to remove her bid for the post. When the shoe was on the other foot, her accomplishments and legal prowess meant nothing to the callous left. Now we are seeing it yet again. Obama gets to nominate those leaning left, but if a man such as Gorsuch even looks to the right as he stands in the middle, he is called a NAZI.When asked by the same reporter, “When do you see potentially a floor vote?” Graham replied, “At the end of the week. It’s sad but we are where we are.” This is again the refrain from those who stand near the Constitution, which is something noticed often when dealing with the wiles of the Democrats. What it boils down to is that the godless can be promoted, but any judge that finds a place for any God mentioned within the founding documents is to be vilified.The left and the MSM has hurled every fake accusation imaginable towards Trump and to Gorsuch.Likewise, if a judge suggests that abortions are legal, even up to the eve of the actual birth, then such a person is fit to rule on the nation’s highest court. If the same judge were to question if it is murder to cut a viable baby from its mother by suctioning the brain from it’s crushed skull, then that judge is said to be unfit due to his hatred of women. God forbid if the judge were to observe the fact that the Constitution says that abortion, like healthcare, should be an issue left to the states, something not even addressed by the Supreme Court. This, to the left, would be grounds for stoning the offending judge in question.AdvertisementTo get around these facts, an elaborate and needless dance is done with every nominee that any leader sends up for confirmation. Step one, questions about how a judge would rule if “FILL IN THE BLANK” were to happen. To that, the judge replies that there is no way to answer since facts of any case could sway an answer that may appear right today. Judges will often use this tactic so that future cases are not thought to have an outcome before all truths are gathered.Ted Cruz (R-TX) has said that Judge Gorsuch is being treated unfairly by the left in America during his confirmation.From there the dance goes onward, droning to the point where the judge is asked how he or she feels about “FILL IN THE BLANK.” This they do to try and trap the judge into saying whether or not they are pro-gun, pro-life, etc. Once this data is used, it can be manipulated by the opposing side to ruin the judge’s prospects. So, the judge replies with something like, “My personal feelings on the matter have no ruling in my interpretation of the law.” This dance goes on and on with the same cadence coming in reply to every question on every hot button topic. Both sides are so galvanized that almost no one can speak freely and there is almost NO mention of the judge’s actual qualifications.That is the saddest part! No one reads much in the paper about what any judge has done, or how their ruling affected the community and state. It is about the coat hanger, the guns, and any other agenda that the one asking the question can drum up. At the end of the day, what the average American knows about any potential Supreme Court Judge is the kind of information that they would want if they were running for President of the United States of America, not as a Justice. This one fact speaks volumes about how badly our sense of civic importance has been mired in left vs. right mindsets.AdvertisementSupreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch has faced a barrage of Trump hatred more than he has a confirmation hearing.With or without Graham’s “nuclear option,” the fact that it has come to even discussing this over someone as middle of the road with his conservative views as Gorsuch is a testimony to a flawed set of Senators. It may be time to really consider how many incumbents on either side we wish to keep in office if this is the kind of thing that America is going to have to face every time that a president chooses a Supreme Court Judge. There are more important things to the people of the U.S. than who our Supreme Court Justices have voted for, and that is basically what this amounts to.Share:








Tom Perez, former Labor Secretary and current Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (pictured above).Ever since Trump announced his decision to run for the presidency, intolerant liberals have been determined to attack him whenever possible. Even though he’s almost been in office for one hundred days, and has been fulfilling many of his campaign promises, Democrats insist that he is evil and incompetent. Some even engage in conspiratorial thinking. The newly elected Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, is no stranger to conspiratorial reasoning. In a recently released video, the DNC chair appears to go crazy in front of a crowd of supporters. In the video, the unhinged liberal is seen spewing explicit language from behind a podium.On Friday, the New Jersey Working Families Alliance hosted a rally in Newark, Pennsylvania. The DNC Chair was given an opportunity to speak about how the Democratic party can move forward. Instead, he used it as an opportunity to attack the President.AdvertisementTom Perez, former Labor Secretary and current Chairman of the Democratic National Committee.His speech began with extremely fiery rhetoric. Standing in front of a cheering audience, he started his talk by thanking those who showed up to Washington D.C. for Trump’s Inauguration. Appealing to his audience’s emotions, Perez claimed that people stormed D.C. and jointly proclaimed, “Donald Trump, you don’t stand for our values… Donald Trump, you didn’t win the election.”He also took the time to mock Trump. After reiterating thoughts about a conspiracy theory having to do with the idea that Trump didn’t “win this election,” he attempted to make fun of the President’s success by shouting about how he “wants his name on everything.” Further, Perez took aim at the American Health Care Act, the Republican Party’s first attempt at repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. “I’ll tell you my idea because you know what embodies their program? ‘I don’t care.’”Later on in his speech, he acknowledged his crude language, saying he doesn’t give a “s***” if people are offended by what he has to say, just like how “Republican’s don’t give a s*** about people,” referring to the recent health care reforms pushed by the President and members of Congress. It’s unclear whether alcohol or other substances influenced the former Secretary of Labor’s outrageous profanity-laced tirade. The video of his hate-filled statements can be viewed below. AdvertisementWarning: This video contains graphic language:Outraged, many conservatives are expecting an apology. The new chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna Romney McDaniel, condemned the comments made by Perez and demanded an apology for what she labeled “dangerous” remarks. She also used the opportunity to humiliate Perez, adding, “[he] needs a lesson on how the electoral college works.” However, despite demands, Perez remains indignant, refusing to apologize. In response to criticism about his recent statements, Xochitl Hinojosa, a spokeswoman for Perez, doubled down on the claims suggesting Trump was not rightly elected and hinted at potentially making more comments in the future. “Tom has not only pointed out that the Russians interfered in this election to help Donald Trump get elected, but Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million people,” she stated. “Since before Trump stepped foot in the Oval Office, his divisive and destructive views had already been rejected by a vast majority of the American people.” In a tweet responding to someone criticizing him for doubling down, Perez made his partisanship clear, saying, “sorry not sorry.”  AdvertisementSorry not sorry. https://t.co/PPyuzAwbpq— Tom Perez (@TomPerez) April 3, 2017In February 2017, Perez took the reigns of the Democratic Party after a winning a hotly contested campaign against Keith Ellison (D–Minn). He started attacking Trump almost immediately. “Someday, they’re going to study this era of American history,” Perez noted, adding, “they’re going to ask the question of all of us: Where were you in 2017 when we had the worst president in the history of the United States? We will be able to say that the Democratic Party led the resistance and made sure this was a one-term president.”His first act as chairman to was to make Ellison, a converted Muslim who received a massive amount of support from the progressive and leftist faction of the Democratic Party (including an endorsement from Bernie Sanders (D-Vt) and his fanbase), his deputy. In a statement, Sanders cautioned the new chairman, claiming “[it’s] imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same old is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before.”AdvertisementSenator Bernie Sanders (D-Vt).This appointment has made several conservatives extremely concerned. During his campaign against Perez, many criticized the new convert for his past ties to the Nation of Islam, an anti-Semitic hate group, as well as previous comments he’s made involving black nationalism and anti-Semitism. Ellison has also recently shown support for a Virginia assembly candidate, Esam Omeish, who called on Palestinians to embrace “the jihad way.” In front of a crowd holding signs equating the Star of David to the Nazi swastika, the jihadi sympathizer proclaimed, “we the Muslims of the Washington metropolitan area are here today…to tell our brothers and sisters in [Palestine] that you have learned the way, that you have known that the jihad way is the way to liberate your land.”There are even many liberals that are worried about Ellison. Haim Saban, a heavy donor to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, opposed Ellison because of comments he made against Israel. Alan Dershowitz, a renowned lawyer, threatened to leave the Democratic Party if Ellison won the DNC runoff. According to Dershowitz, “he worked with and repeatedly defended one of a handful of the most notorious and public anti-Semites in our country: The Reverend Louis Farrakhan,” adding, “[he] worked with Farrakhan at the very time this anti-Semite was publicly describing Judaism as a ‘gutter religion’ and insisting that the Jews were a primary force in the African slave trade.”Congressman Keith Ellison (D-Minn).Based on the behavior of many in the Democratic Party, it is clear that they’re falling apart. They have abandoned any vision that they may have had in the past and have become the “opposition party.” They use their resources to attack Trump and promote conspiracies rather than promote any sort of agenda. Ironically, since they tend to promote legislation that hurts impoverished communities more than it helps, departing from their policy is a surprising relief to many. Regardless of the fact that this strategy may ultimately result in less suffering, it is unprofessional and ultimately undermines our democracy. Share:








Is disarming the officers who could stop an active shooter the answer to a police state?In a culture that sees so many people wanting to kill cops, both of school age and older, it makes sense for an officer to know where his weapon is. He or she knows that while a few cops do some unthinkable acts, and sometimes the law itself is skewed, the average officer has little say over such things. Many people that go off on a killing spree would only be too happy to take the lives of a few policemen on the way down. The officers know this and accept it when they take their post each day, but the ACLU has managed to make the target on their chests glow by REMOVING THEIR FIREARMS!The Gun Page is reporting that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) does not want school officers to be armed. The reason for wanting to disarm the security staff is because the Senior Policy Advocate of Pennsylvania’s ACLU chapter, Harold Jordan, feels, “Having officers patrol the hallways with firearms sends a negative message to students.” He also said “ It makes many students feel that they are being treated like suspects. It can have an intimidating presence and can contribute to negative attitudes about police, in general.” This is according to an opinion piece that he wrote for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.The ACLU was founded by Communists, and Communists have historically limited the people’s access to guns before they slaughtered them.AdvertisementThe fact of the matter is that, if used against the student body, then Jordan could be seen as prudent and thoughtful. After all, we have all heard reports about gun-toting officers getting overly worrisome when something transpires in the school. Police officers should not be allowed to pull firearms on students for having a yelling match (or even a fist fight, unless they attack the officer), but that is not what they are there for in total.There are threats from both students, as well as the “garden variety” madman/lone shooter type that some schools have chosen to deal with by posting officers on the grounds. Active shooters can kill a lot of children and facility in a short amount of time. Having law enforcement on the grounds can limit the death toll if he has his gun! Otherwise, he is target number one, the man to shoot before he calls for back-up.The people who will face the blame should a threat manifest itself, the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers (PFT), feels differently. They argue that the best way to combat violence is to make sure that it is limited. This is done by having a strong presence of counterforce visible on the grounds. Most shooters choose areas that are “GUN FREE” zones (like schools) to attack, so adding an officer prevents it from being a such an easy target. PFT even passed a resolution two years ago that states, “Pittsburgh school police officers receive the same firearms training as municipal police and often are the first responders to dangerous situations,” according to the Post-Gazette article.There are some facts that are obvious to everyone, but the ACLU.AdvertisementWith such training, it can not be imagined that some Wild West officer is going pull his gun on little Johnny for chewing gum in class. If such a gross act does occur, then fire the officer, but not the program. If we halted every program in place every time that someone within it did something irresponsible, then what system would we ever have in place? The ACLU knows this just as sure as they know that night shall follow the closing day.This is not about protecting children from feeling like they are in a jail. If that were true, there would be a much larger push to protect our Posse Comitatus Laws that prevent our police from looking like our military. For that who may not know, Posse Comitatus is an act put in place that “is to limit the powers of the federal government in using federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States,” according to Wikipedia. It is the very law that works to prevent us from becoming a police state, much more than an officer doing his job in a school. That, which is the real threat to liberty, is happening daily. The left does not stand against this because they are not really worried about a police state; they are worried about people trusting guns.Oddly enough, our Constitution warns that the opposite is true. The Law of the Land says that, when we think about it, Jordan is RIGHT. Maybe, as we read the neglected document, it is NOT the job of the police to do this. It is really the job of the adults to ensure that the children are taken care of. In some high schools where law enforcement is taught or where responsible gun training is offered, perhaps even some students carry them already. By and large, however, it is the adult’s job to protect the kids, so why not arm the teachers who choose to claim the right? Putting a gun into the hands of a teacher who is opposed or scared of the idea is worse than them having no gun at all, but many would welcome the option. Those that would accept this responsibility should be able to.The truth about when a gun takes an innocent life compared to how often it protects from criminal violence is drastic. It shows that, by a large margin, guns save innocent lives more often than not.AdvertisementThis would mean that instead of the school making the place feel like Alcatraz, kids would simply grow up seeing that some citizens carry a gun. This is their right, after all, so it is no different than hearing that their teacher was allowed to speak freely or be protected from searches and seizures. It is always nice to know that we on the right can agree with our foes on the left. Jordan, as we study this, is perfectly correct. We don’t need the cops in the building with guns, after all. We just to need to read our forgotten and ill-taught Constitution like they did in the old days. This solves the problem and puts the gun into the hands of who it was meant for, which is the law abiding citizen.Let us say that there are two officers in a large school building. It may take a moment for the officers to arrive where the disturbance is happening, even if they are on the grounds. Now, if we erase the officers as Jordan asks, but replace them with ten to fifteen armed and trained teachers, staff members, and principles, we have a new scenario. These are people who have invested their very lives into the development of these children, so they will certainly work to save them under attack, likely laying theirs on the line to do it. It may be time to really look at ideas that make sense, and that are practical, if we are to deal with potential threats in our schools. There are many options at our disposal and virtually ALL of them have to be better than taking guns away from school police officers.President Trump has made his feelings known about “Gun Free Zones.”Share:








President Donald Trump has been doing a GREAT job so far. He is driving the establishment INSANE! However, there is one woman who he trusts above all others: Ivanka Trump.Ivanka has worked a ton and had to put up with a TON of crap since her dad joined politics. However, today she did an interview where she CRUSHED all the haters for good!Ivanka sat down with CBS host Gayle King. Mrs. King asked Ivanka some tough questions. Like how it feels to be called “complicit” by the leftists.Ivanka then glared into the camera and explained she is not complicit unless it means she is driven and working hard to make the world a better place!Boom! Of course, they were referring to a nasty online rumor spread by Saturday Night Live that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are complicit in Donald Trump’s “tyranny.”Here is the SNL clip that Ivana just DESTROYED:But Ivanka was not done there.Gayle King also brought up the fact that leftists LOVE to say Ivanka never stands up to her day. Ivanka just called it a FAKE story!Ivanka says she chooses to disagree directly and not make “public denouncements” of her father because he listens to her opinion and cares about what she thinks.Donald Trump may only have been Presidents for a few months, but Ivanka Trump is by far the BEST First Daughter America has ever had. PERIOD!Let’s show the world how Amazing she is and get this Shared out all over the place. Who here LOVES Ivanka?!








Wikileaks founder Julian Assange tweeted out a series of warnings to the liberals on Monday. He started with a tweet to explain how the American left has embraced the institutions that it once hated.JULIAN ASSANGE: US 'progressives' are celebrating neocons, FBI & CIA in their existential battle to dethrone Trump https://t.co/9OyJLwR5kI— Julian Assange (@JulianAssange) April 3, 2017Assange then linked to the amazing video by Paul Joseph Watson that explained that conservatism is the new counter-culture. Yeah. You heard that here. Conservatives are cool again.It’s cool to be patriotic again. Communists need to start running scared.Julian Assange warned that the left better come back to the middle or they will get destroyed by the right. Nobody listens to the mainstream media.Unless the left disengages from establishment capture the alt-right will destroy it:1) https://t.co/BpA18idxFw2) https://t.co/BpA18idxFw— Julian Assange (@JulianAssange) April 3, 2017SHARE this right now! Get this out there. Let the Democrats know that we the people of the United States want our rights back.Share this with a liberal that you know! Let them know that they now stand for the Deep state and not for the people of this country. Tell them to turn off CNN. Tell them to cancel their New York Times subscription. Tell them that we both bleed the same American blood and we will work together to make this country great again. (h/t The Gateway Pundit)








Independent journalist Mike Cernovich had a phone conference on air with GotNews founder, Chuck Johnson. You can watch that below. THIS IS HUGE: According to Chuck Johnson, Sean Hannity and Erik Prince were spied on by Obama.This is massive. Obama was the spy king. The liberal media won’t admit it but Obama spied on EVERYONE! Frickin’ Everyone.BREAKING NEWS! Obama administration spied on Sean Hannity and Erik Prince, per Chuck Johnson.— Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) April 4, 2017Sean Hannity needs to know this. Get this out there! This just came out right after leftist media pointed out that Erik Prince had a secret meeting in Seychelles.Here is what Sean Hannity said about the Susan Rice issue:*** SHARE this 500,000 times!! Sean Hannity needs to know. Get this out there, patriots! (h/t The Gateway Pundit)








Susan Rice was entitled to ask that the names of Trump’s transition team members be unmasked as part of her role in the government, but when she revealed their identities, it could now be considered “espionage.”That’s what Judge Napolitano says:It’s plain and simple.“It depends on what she did with the information she unmasked,” the Fox News legal analyst told the “Fox & Friends” program, after he was asked if Rice broke any laws.Here is what he said below:“If she needs to know to whom the ambassador was speaking, in order to understand the conversation, she can do that,” said Napolitano. “Can she reveal the identity of the American for a purpose other than national security? Absolutely not.”Then Juge Napolitano took it further:If Rice had gotten the names and then passed them on to Obama by saying, “By the way, guess what Trump and Manafort were talking about last night” then that would be considered “espionage.”If this is true, then Susan Rice is going to be in big trouble and this is going to finally make steps to drain the swamp.*** SHARE this 1 million times if you think that Obama should pay for his crimes!We have to keep the energy high. We cannot let the Democrats sweep this one under the rug. Trump needs us! (h/t News Max)








Anyone who has been watching the news recently is sure to have heard all about North Korea and their nukes. They also know President Donald Trump is NOT happy about it and he and Mattis are ready to STRIKE BACK!Well, today one of America’s top Army Generals, Four-Star General Jack Keane, gave President Trump exactly what he needs…That’s right. A full out, pre-emptive strike is quickly becoming our ONLY option.Keane told the Times,“A preemptive strike against launch facilities, underground nuclear sites, artillery and rocket response forces and regime leadership targets may be the only option left on the table.”Now the Four-Star General is not necessarily happy about this. He understands how significant that attack would be and that it would most likely lead to a years-long ground war with North Korea.He was HOPING China would help but after YEARS of diplomacy, they have made it very clear they will NOT support us.“Our attempts to leverage China in the past have failed miserably. Sanctions have not worked against North Korea and I doubt more sanctions will and I don’t believe sanctions against China will work any better.”Still, President Trump will be having a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this weekend and ask him one, final time to help out with North Korea.If you are glad we are finally dealing with the MASSIVE threat of Kim Jong Un, then don’t let the MSM stop this from getting out. It’s time to get this Shared out across the whole internet!!








LifeZette editor-in-chief Laura Ingraham went on Fox News and blasted the media for not reporting on Susan Rice. This is a major scandal.This Susan Rice is going to EXPLODE. The liberal media is literally freaking out trying not to cover it. Seriously.Watch this. It’s frickin’ embarrassing.Here is what LifeZette said: “In the wake of bombshell reports Monday indicating former national security adviser Susan Rice had “unmasked” associates of President Donald Trump, the mainstream media largely ignored the story or even flatly denied the seriousness of the revelations.”“This is such a low point for the American media,” LifeZette Editor-in-Chief Laura Ingraham said on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday. “I mean, they have been pounding the Russia story for weeks — even though top officials have said they have no evidence that any Russia involvement in our election or attempt to meddle in our election had any effect. They stay on that story.”This proves that the media is going to bury this story. They are pushing the Russia fake news story over the wiretapping one for the past 24 hours. Most CNN anchors are claiming this story as “baseless” and “nonsense.”**** SHARE LAURA’S WORDS! The mainstream media doesn’t want this getting out.Thanks for reading. (h/t Lifezette)








Most Americans haven’t heard of this story yet. Former Congressman Michele Bachmann (R-MN) said that the FBI listening to President Donald Trump’s staffers talk to Russians was “worse than Watergate.”Here is the video with Michelle Bachmann below:You heard that right here:What Democrats did to Donald Trump was “worse than Watergate.”She said this to USA Radio host Rusty Humphries on Monday. Where is the media on this?? They are investigating fake Trump-Russia connections.“This is a thousand times worse than Watergate,” Bachmann told Humphries. “This is the only thing the press should be talking about for the next month.”“This is against the law. What the Obama administration did is surveil Americans citizens for political purposes to hurt the Trump campaign politically,” Bachmann said.*** SHARE MRS. BACHMANN’S WORDS! Keep the energy up. The Democrats and their media are trying to bury this story. We cannot let them. This is worse than Watergate. Do not let this drop!!Here is what Tucker Carlson said last night about this. He does a great job.Thanks for reading. (h/t Raw Story)








Tonight it has been finally made clear that Republicans are DONE Messing around.Sen Lindsey Graham said,“If we have to, we will change the rules. It looks like we’re going to have to.Yesterday the Democrats managed to reach the 41 people they needed to filibuster Gorsuch. It’s like McConnell told FOX News,“I think it is noteworthy that no Supreme Court justice has ever in the history of our country been stopped by a partisan filibuster- ever.”The only option Republicans have left is to change the rules from 60 people supporting the nominee to a simple 51-49 majority.President Trump put up Neil Gorsuch up for Supreme Court because he is PERFECT for the job. He is qualified, smart, and even won unanimous support from the Senate once before.Fine. You know what, if Democrats wanna fight dirty, then two can play at this game. I say we do what is needed to get Gorsuch in place. After that, we can do a ton more to help get our country back on track.If you wanna see Republicans fo WHATEVER it takes to guarantee Neil Gorsuch ends up on the Supreme Court, then Share this everywhere and let the world know!








Mark Cuban may look like a fool most the time, but after what he said about Trump today there is not a person in the world who will listen to him again..Now Cuban is not great at reading people. After all, his logic assumes that Donald Trump is too dumb to work with Putin. Oh yeah? Well he still beat you and Hillary!9) No chance this is a DJT led conspiracy. He isn't detail oriented, organized or big picture enough to pull off any time of conspiracy— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) April 1, 2017This tweet chain was all part of his BS conspiracy, totally made up, about how Trump REALLY won the election.Just to remind all y’all, Mark Cuban volunteered to run as both Trump’s and Hillary Clinton’s Vice President. Neither said yes.I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017Also, just a few weeks back Cuban spoke directly to Breitbart where he complimented Trump’s economic policies.See? There are 2 lessons to be learned here:So thanks, Mr. Cuban. Your rambling has once again reminded us WHY we elected Trump in the first place. Maybe Cuban’s brain doesn’t work too well…Who the hell really knows?








On Sunday, Mike Cernovich made the connection that National Security Advisor Susan Rice is the Obama administration leaker and unmasker.WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW.Here is what Mike Cernovich wrote on his Medium:“The White House Counsel’s office identified Rice as the person responsible for the unmasking after examining Rice’s document log requests. The reports Rice requested to see are kept under tightly-controlled conditions. Each person must log her name before being granted access to them.”“Upon learning of Rice’s actions, H. R. McMaster dispatched his close aide Derek Harvey to Capitol Hill to brief Chairman Nunes.”“Unmasking” is the process of identifying individuals whose communications were caught in the dragnet of intelligence gathering. While conducting investigations into terrorism and other related crimes, intelligence analysts incidentally capture conversations about parties not subject to the search warrant. The identities of individuals who are not under investigation are kept confidential, for legal and moral reasons.”John Bolton repeated Cernovich’s claims and said that if Susan Rice is going to have some real legal problems.Ain’t that the truth..@AmbJohnBolton says Susan Rice defrauded the intelligence system: “She’s got real legal problems here.” #MAGA #Dobbs @POTUS pic.twitter.com/IIqdBN5AS0— Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) April 3, 2017*** SHARE this, patriots!! We need to get this out there. The mainstream media is trying not to cover this, but the smoking gun just leaked that will ruin Obama.Thanks for reading and please help us get this out there. Please help Liberty Writers fight the mainstream media. It’s only with your help that we can even try.








Sen. Rand Paul told Reporters On Monday Obama’s former National Security Advisor Susan Rice needs to “testify under oath.” The official scoop came from Bloomberg News originally.*** This is the smoking gun!Paul said that the reports that Rice made over a dozen requests to learn the identities of anonymous people in Trump’s transition team was “enormous news” and it is!Imma let Lou Dobbs take it away:“If it is allowed, we shouldn’t be allowing it. I don’t think we should discount how big a deal it is that Susan rice was looking at these,” Paul told the assembled reporters.Rand Paul showed his concerns about Susan rice 3 years ago:Then Rand Paul ripped into Susan Rice:“She needs to be asked, ‘did President Obama ask her to do this?’ I think she ought to testify under oath on this,” Paul said.Then Rand Paul said: “I think she should be asked under oath, did she reveal it to the Washington Post?”This is horrible. This is the smoking gun. Rand Paul is right. Obama deserves to go to prison for this!*** SHARE this 1 million times, patriots! The time is now. Get the news out there.Comment ‘OBAMA FOR PRISON!’ below this post on Facebook. Let’s make this go viral and let America know that it is time to arrest Obama. He is a criminal. (h/t Breitbart)Thanks for reading, patriots!








If nothing else, President Donald Trump is a man of his word. He said he was gonna Drain the Swamp and he IS and he said he was gonna donate his first check and, by George, he’s done it.The donation was very public after Sean Spicer brought out the new Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke and had him present the check live on camera.Trump was expected to give the money to a charity, so him donating to the Government came as a big surprise. Still, it’s hard to complain.So once again President Trump has shown us how honorable AND generous he can be by keeping his word.You know what? I’d bet you the mainstream media are gonna bury this story so deep that nobody will EVER find it. I think you, me, and everyone we know oughta share this out and let the world see that TRUMP IS GOOD!








Today, Donald Trump was supposed to sign some MAJOR executive orders on trade. That is NOT what ended up happening…Trump, Mike Pence, and the whole crew showed up ready for the signing. The President went to the podium, looked down, and got PI$$ED!He is sick and tired of these deals. He is not gonna simply sign any mediocre orders. Instead, he swore to take down ALL the trade cheaters out there.Trump said,Trump also ordered his staff to review all of our debts and compile a list for him of countries contributing to our deficit.If you ask me, it’s GREAT to see a president taking so much initiative in trying to get our trade and finances back on track.At the same time, he is giving the military the money they were needing and lowering our deficit.Hey, if all y’all are as proud as I am of Mr. President Trump, do him a big old favor and help Share this out.Donald J Trump is awesome. He is hard at work daily to get America great again and it’s not politics. If it’s not good for America he works to get it right. For too long many people/countries have walked all over us and “leaders” thought it wouldn’t be politically correct to stand up to it. Take the politics out of  the equation and we’ve got a real leader. I am proud that President Trump is our leader.So what did he see that made him so mad?https://youtu.be/fgsJ4y9vWXgDanny, you need to change this story. He didn’t walk out because of the terms of the agreements or what VP Pence showed him, POTUS walked out because a reporter started to ask him about Mike Flynn and his request for immunity. Clearly POTUS was making a clear statement that he wasn’t going to allow these reporters to change the celebratory mood and the agenda of the signing.Standing up for the American People good job Mr.TrumpThank you, Mr. President.  We the people are counting on you to stop this insanity.  So far you are doing a FANTASTIC job.   Love for you and your family from a grandma in Topeka, Ks.   Drain the swamp and Make America Great again.Its now that America is getting its manliness…..all lost during the past 10 years.Raise fines on those nations detering Trade BUT Not on products on the Govts alone.
Deter tourism for Trade.
Seize assets.good for you mr trump were behind you all the way it looks like your going to have to get tuff with some of thes things its clear that the dems are not going to do eneything but go against every thing you try to do and that cant be good for the country and for this reason maney of them will be voted out of office in 2018 we also have a few republicans that are on the border line of being bumped off to if the dont start going along with the program these dam fools dont think they can be voted out but they will be verry supprised come 2018 they dident think you would winn the election ether but they under estamated the silent voters we the people are tired of these people if they dont want to govern then we will replace them with some that will so keep up the good work mr president and stay tuff we appreciate youI am very proud of President Trump.Some people call it protectionism or a trade war, DJT calls it smart business, I agree.








Donald Trump was 100% right! Barack Obama DID make a massive rule change right before leaving office just to get away with spying on President Trump.There was a longstanding rule that forced intelligence agencies to censor the names of Americans intercepted during monitoring on foreign nationals before passing them on.According to the new report from Circa.com, however, Obama made a last minuted switch up that allowed him to target Trump and his team!Obama changed a key rule that allowed him to unmask and then share the names revealed with all of his top staff including, but not limited to, Susan Rice, John Brennan, and Loretta Lynch.The report also alleges that some of the intercepted reports gathered between November and January concerned figures in Donald Trump’s transition team who were communicating with foreign nationals.Luckily, however, the NSA is expected to hand over a full and detailed report to Congress soon revealing who and to what degree Obama abused this rule to spy on.One source said,“Wholesale access to unmasked incidental NSA intercepts essentially created the potential for spying on Americans overseas after the fact, which is exactly what our foreign intelligence arms are not supposed to be doing.”This is a very SERIOUS accusation. If it is all true, and it seems more and more likely that it is, that means Obama violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution that protects Americans from unlawful and unreasonable search and seizures.Of course, you and I both know the media will do their best to cover this up. That’s why it’s up to us to SHARE this truth everywhere!








Today is a very great day. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and Judge Neil Gorsuch just got a MASSIVE win for joining the Supreme Court.The Senator from Indiana released this statement,“After meeting with Judge Gorsuch, conducting a thorough review of his record, and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well-respected among his peers.”He now joins the ranks of other Democrats willing to see reason and work with Republicans including Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND).To make this win even sweeter, Sen Donnely’s declaration came just HOURS after Chuck Schumer said he didn’t think Gorsuch could get enough Democrats to support him. JOKES ON YOU!Sure, he still needs 8 more Dems to reach the 60 vote threshold, but there is time.You can bet President Trump is pretty excited. He released a special Weekly Address this week and it’s all about Gorsuch:If you are excited to see Gorsuch winning so much AND Democrats FINALLY willing to do the right thing and actually work with Republicans, then you gotta help us spread the joy and SHARE this out everywhere!Paul Ryan is done with. Because he betrayed the party and for that, cannot stay in office long. Trump with good people to back him can take this all the way. Democrats have to realize They need to stand together with Trump, because we all know Schumer is done for as well as Pelosi. With the sex scandals, and child trafficking, and the scam Pelosi and her son did that nobody is reporting on. I find it odd, but predictable to assume it would all go away and we would forget. the problem is we did not forget. I am sure the next couple weeks will be remembered for a long time.








On March 27, 2017 one family’s peace was disturbed, at their own home, by three would-be burglars.  But these burglars did not get away with their terrifying crime.Instead of the pillaging and who knows what else these three would-be felons intended, they ended up at the wrong end of a firearm allegedly held by 23 year old Zach Peters, according to Amber Randall of The Daily Caller News Foundation.Listening to the 911 call, you can hear that the alleged family defender has compassion for the intruders, three teenage boys who clearly were not taught, or never learned, rules and respect.  But what he allegedly did was self-defense, plain and simple.Now, none of us wants to hear about three teenagers losing their young lives.  But was the 23 year old alleged family defender supposed to potentially lose his?  According to the grandfather of one of the alleged burglars, Leroy Schumacher, they did not deserve to die for their crime, reports KTUL.Of course, we understand that this grandfather is grieving.  He admits his grandson and the two other teens made a “bad decision,” but says they “did not deserve to die, ” reports KTUL.Again, of course he is grieving.  But anyone knows, or should, that if you break into someone’s home, their place of peace and privacy, you could end up on the other end of someone’s Second Amendment right to protect themselves, their loved ones and their property.We will be praying for all involved, and all of their loved ones.  AND, we will also insist on maintaining our Second Amendment!LIKE and SHARE this article with everyone you know who supports the Second Amendment.  And COMMENT, #SupporttheSecondAmendment.








This is a very dark day for the legendary FOX News reporter, Bill O’Reilly.The biggest suit wasThe other 4 women got a total of $6 Million from him.To make it worse, both Wendy Walsh and Andrea Tantaros have also accused O’Reilly of sexual harassment. Neither of them have gotten a payout as of this article being written.Damn, that does NOT look good.So is this the end of The O’Reilly Factor? Well, from the looks of this statement released by 21st Century FOX, probably not:Notwithstanding the fact that no current or former Fox News employee ever took advantage of the 21st Century Fox hotline to raise a concern about Bill O’Reilly, even anonymously, we have looked into these matters over the last few months and discussed them with Mr. O’Reilly. ‘While he denies the merits of these claims, Mr. O’Reilly has resolved those he regarded as his personal responsibility. ‘Mr. O’Reilly is fully committed to supporting our efforts to improve the environment for all our employees at Fox News.See? So is Bill O’Reilly guilty or is this just another attack on a conservative pundit? That’s up to a court to decide.As of now, the best we can do is help SPREAD the Truth around Facebook and not let the Leftist Media write their own version of the story…I caught a SS of Mister O’Reilly during Lindsey Graham on.
No Question the MAN gave the 666 hand sign into the camera.
FOX news is just as corrupt as the Pope and Papacy.








How are those little pink knit caps the liberal feminists wore to try to disgrace our beloved American President at his inauguration supposedly now oppressing transgenders?  Well, apparently, transgender women are feeling sad because they don’t have real female reproduction parts (because God didn’t give them those!), so they feel that they can’t be a part of the modern feminist movement!  You’re kidding me, right?   And they are even blaming President Donald Trump for their allegedly being left out of their rightful part in the feminist movement, because, after all, it was Mr. Trump who made those comments we all remember and that the Democrats tried to make such a BIG DEAL! Well, obviously it wasn’t such a big deal, because he is now our PRESIDENT!  LIKE and SHARE if you think liberals are a bunch of CRY BABY, EXCUSE MAKERS!








When it comes to being all about the law with ZERO B.S., Trey Gowdy is the absolute KING! Today, he proved it again by taking down CNN with only 2 Words.The CNN hostess, Alisyn Camerota, tried to trick Gowdy by asking him if he was investigating the Russia-election claims and Devin Nunes at the same time. She was CLEARLY implying they were tied together.That’s when Gowdy fired back with this:Gowdy schooled Camerota by telling her,Alisyn, the trip to the White House that Devin took had nothing to do with Russia. So let’s don’t conflate the trip with the investigation.”He summed it up so simple, even a liberal TV show host could understand,“What Devin went to the White House about has nothing to do with Russia, so put that in a separate track. I was ready yesterday to start interviewing witnesses, all of them.”Great job, Mr. Gowdy! You absolutely OWNED those “Fake News” makers at CNN.Maybe they should take a lesson in honesty and hard work from this man. If you love Trey Gowdy, and I know you do, then let him know and Share this everywhere!








Modern day liberals have absolutely NO SHAME! I mean sure, the hippy movement was bad, but these new ones make hippies look like nuns! Don’t believe me? Just take a look at what they are doing to Kellyanne Conway, a HERO of women.So some liberals were out browsing the web and came across THIS picture of actor Patrick Stewart in drag:Something is happening in Hollywood tonight. pic.twitter.com/hhDTqOtBx5— Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) April 19, 2016Now, he did this back in 2016 and meant no harm by it. However, the leftists decided “Oh, he looks kinda like Kellyanne Conway.” So what did they do with it?This is not just sad, it’s plain disrespectful.We are talking about a hard working mother of 3 who STILL found time and energy needed to become the first woman EVER to manage a winning US Presidential campaign!While SNL and Stewart have not confirmed anything, you can bet that the Leftist TROLLS are working hard to make their dreams come true.Now, there is nothing wrong with making fun of public figures if it’s done FAIRLY, but we all know SNL will not do that. That’s why we gotta fight back and protect Kellyanne Conway from their abuse.The best ways to do this are STOP watching SNL and share this to let them know this is one step TOO FAR!NEXT PAGE==>They have no shame to continue to degrade people.  They are vultures who live off of making fun of others.  We want to tell Kellyanne she is a breath of fresh air  and we appreciate the truth from her instead of the constant lies that come from the Liberals, Demo-Rats and the Shadow Government. You are nothing but disgusting good for nothings.  Why not make fun of your Heros, OVomit and Killary or Slick Willie and leave the rest of the decent people alone. These people deserve it as they sold there souls long ago.  They took there 30 pieces of Silver and they will reap what they have sown.








HBO’S Bill Maher is getting trashed by the “Real Time” panel on Friday in a debate over Islam’s role in the London terror attack.Watch this:If you didn’t hear, the terrorist rammed a truck into citizens on the Westminster Bridge right outside the house of Parliament. This attack killed four people – included one American.“This is another example where we take one group of people and we demonize them,” said Louise Mensch, a Heat Street columnist.“The guy was British-born. His name was Adrian before his converted. And partisans of Russia were out in the streets saying it was an illegal immigrant who did it, trying to turn the London people against our Muslim friends and neighbors. And you’re not going to do that.”“Let’s not pretend this has nothing to do with Islam, the religion,” Maher said. “It doesn’t,” Mensch responded. “It has nothing to do with Islam the same way Timothy McVeigh had nothing to do with Roman Catholicism.”“Every time some bomb goes off, before it goes off, somebody yells ‘Allahu Akbar!’” said Maher. “I never hear anybody go ‘Merry Christmas! This one’s for the flying nun!’ ”“When Christians do anything like this, do we ever say, ‘Christian terrorism’?” asked Yale professor Timothy Snyder.“No. But is Christian terrorism as big a problem?” asked Maher in response.We might not agree on a lot of things, but Bill Maher is right about this. When are we going to call this what it is. Islamic extremism is a problem that needs to be dealt with.*** SHARE this if you agree! We need to address the problem of Islamic terrorism immediately before the western world falls. (h/t The Hill)

FORGET  ABOUT  PELOSI  AND  SCHUMER  THESE  THREE  ARE  TRUMP’S  REAL  ENEMIESNever Mind Schumer and Pelosi…President Trump’s Real Enemies are McCain, McConnell and Ryan Politics makes strange bedfellows, and no doubt, any person who relishes longevity in a political career must be reconciled to staying extremely agile in pursuit of the right bed to jump in and out of. In a world where friends alternate roles as friends or enemies almost as quickly as changing socks, words like commitment, longevity and loyalty ultimately matter little. In their most common usage relative to the current American political scene, they are at best used as a punchline.We accept the splutterings of the cognitively impaired Nancy Pelosi, who shamelessly persists in peddling the tabloid drivel about Russian collusion with Donald Trump, even though neither the F.B.I. nor the National Security Administration to date has yet to find a scintilla of evidence in support of such intrigue.We also accept the angst of Democrats because they lost the White House and of Chuck Schumer, who becomes sullen and prone to crying fits, especially when Executive Orders designed to protect Americans at home are perceived to be a violation of the “inherent rights”of illegal aliens from Muslim countries potentially bent on destroying us. We accept these dramatics from the opposition party as a de facto component of day-to-day national politics.Yes, we expect that from the likes of the aforementioned. Is this however the real threat against Donald Trump? Closer scrutiny suggests that the President need not cross the aisle to find determined and resolute enemies. Within his own party, unscrupulous, traitorous and equally determined politicians are just as focused on derailing the nascent Trump Presidency. As vicious, calculating and motivated to undermine as any among the Democratic party, the real “Fifth Column” against Trump is embodied by three Republicans In Name Only (RINO).
 Take John McCain as a primary example. He is an idea whose time has passed, a relic, a begrudger and worst of all, a man bent on maintaining the status quo for no other reason then slaking his own over inflated ego.This is a man who passes himself off as member of the United States Senate, and then stands before an audience of Nato/European member nations stating with conviction how his own Republican President’s administration is in a state of disarray. This is a man who is the most recognizable face of the “political establishment,” a man who stood on the same stage with Barack Obama in 2008 and stated with convincing self-righteousness how the American economy was sound, even as the tidal wave of economic collapse was washing the homes, pensions, businesses and savings of millions of ordinary Americans into the sewer.It is a stroke of good fortune that McCain is now the doddering old idiot he is, because the likelihood of his running and being elected for another chance to retain power in the Senate beyond his current term is probably not too great if, in fact, he makes it to the end of his term. That at least is one silver lining in the cloud for decent and honest Americans. His Obama/Kerry formula of constant regime change apparently has never been enough, and he certainly seemed during various junctures of the Presidential campaign that Hillary Clinton’s election to the White House would have been more happily received. Why not, as Clinton would have gotten in McCain a sure fire choir boy for beating the confrontation drum against depraved and immoral Russia, with McCain simultaneously playing his now famous parody of the lyrics to the Beach Boys song “Barbra Ann”: bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran…They still would have both been able to espouse their hypocritical condemnations of Putin’s Russian regime, even though Clinton previously sanctioned the sale of substantial amounts of uranium as Secretary of State to the same enemy nation while McCain, as recently as New Year’s Eve, accepted a state medal from Petro Poroshenko, The Order of the Ukraine, for bestowing legitimacy on a blatantly neo-Fascist, genocidal and loathsome political regime–a regime which is a blight and insult to civilization.Why would President Trump seek solace and support for attempting to normalize relations with Putin from such an acolyte of Neocon fanaticism as John McCain? The truth is, McCain was never a supporter of Trump nor ever will be. The best advice for Trump would be to marginalize the increasingly strident voice of McCain with respect to Russia, showing him to be out of touch with the forces that propelled Trump to victory in the general election. In this way, Trump may yet be able to forge a significant working relationship with Putin, while John McCain can continue to be a specially invited guest to neo-Nazi style rallies in Kiev.Following closely on the heals of McCain is the amorphous, colorless but extremely powerful Majority Leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell. He is a man characterized by his closest friends as one who has spent his entire political life in the pursuit of penultimate power. Now that he has it, what will he do with it?It is a question that many of his closest observers have a ready answer for:  absolutely nothing! McConnell doesn’t stand for anything, doesn’t believe in anything and is not going to do anything, especially if it upsets the dynamic of the next election cycle. Someone with as little charisma, and as lacking in political convictions spells real problems for the Trump legislative agenda. Does McConnell have the stomach to push for the kinds of major ideological changes involved in the Trump vision for America, or is he merely concerned in self-preservation? A recent legislative initiative gives mounds of insight into this Republican establishment figure’s lack of moral and political courage.Kate Steinle, a thirty-two-year-old San Francisco woman, shot down in cold blood by an illiterate, illegal Mexican immigrant, who had been deported and illegally returned to the United States not once but six times, became the poster child for everything that is wrong with respect to the current illegal immigration debacle in the U.S.Legislation was proposed making it a Federal crime, punishable by a mandatory prison term of 5 years, for any illegal immigrant who has been deported and returned illegally to the United States a second time and caught. The Legislation passed the House, but this was not to be the case in the Senate, where rather than having a stand alone vote on the measure, McConnell included the legislation in a bill that would take away money from sanctuary cities, something that the Democrats would filibuster, ergo, no passage of Kate’s law.This was a cowardly act on the part of Mitch McConnell. The interests of an illegal alien were more important than protecting an American citizen, in this case, an American citizen with a blossoming life full of wondrous potential, cut down at her own father’s side by a drug-dealing parasite with a second grade education who didn’t belong in the country to begin with. McConnell’s office steadfastly refused to answer calls inquiring as to the rationale for his obvious and unmanly failure of leadership; it just wasn’t good politics to upset the apple cart.The big question for President Trump is whether Senate Republicans, now holding a slight majority, have the kind of leader in Mitch McConnell who will be willing and able to carry the ball far enough down field to score? This should be a great source of concern for team Trump.In line with questions about Senate loyalties to the Administration, we come finally to the House of Representatives and its dishonest and incompetent leader, Paul Ryan. Another fair day supporter of Trump during the last Presidential election cycle, Paul Ryan worked less for getting Trump elected then attempting to sabotage his campaign.Nobody will ever accuse Ryan of being a Thomas Brackett Reed. He has richly proven himself to be an incompetent legislative leader, with a penchant for ass-kissing liberals, dismissing moderates as lacking in conviction and rounding on conservatives, a reflexive action common to establishment Republicans.Take the ACHA, the alternative to OBamacare fast-tracked to failure, courtesy of those intractable Freedom Caucus conservatives…Or was it? Paul Ryan has taken tons of cash from the insurance industry, and his disingenuous attempt to downplay his inability to deliver the votes of moderate Republicans in connection to his pathetic piece of legislation was just that, pathetic.The truth is, something Speaker Ryan has a hard time with, is that those same moderates Ryan claims would never have gone along with repealing the worst aspects of Obamacare were the very same moderates who voted to repeal it sixty times. This time, when it actually mattered, they got free passes for not even having to vote, courtesy of the unprincipled and undisciplined leadership of Paul Ryan. It was a lot easier to blame those uncompromising conservatives, folks who actually believe in keeping their campaign promises to voters.In the aftermath of this stunning defeat, Ryan took to the airwaves to insist that it was the “effort” rather than the final outcome that was key, and that trying to foist a piece of legislation that enjoyed an approval rating of 17% was worthy of our eternal thanks. At another time in our country’s history, such a display would have been viewed as shameful and even cowardice; it has now taken on the trappings of sage pragmatism.It is a cruel testament to just how poorly our leaders govern the country. In the final analysis, Republicans said in 2010 that once they got the House, they would do away with ObamaCare, instead, when they got the majority, they funded it. They said give us the Senate, and we will do away with ObamaCare. When they got the Senate, they funded it. Ryan said when we get a Republican President, we will send Health Care legislation to be signed into law. Trump won, no thanks to Ryan, and what did Ryan do? Rather than pressuring a handful of moderates to honor their previous votes, he introduced a thoroughly dishonest and inferior bill that he knew could never pass, and blamed the few conservatives who did not sell out their constituents. If this is the best that Republicans can do, they are not going to be in government for long.President Trump would do well to grow eyes in the back of his head. His election has shaken an entrenched establishment of people used to having power, wielding power to achieve their own purposes and not willing to give it up. Never mind Democrats, but with respect to his own Republican party, he would do well to follow the advice of Don Vito Corleone, who advised his son Michael of the extreme importance of keeping friends close, but enemies closer. A more appropriate statement might be to have more enemies than friends, because at least you know where you stand with your enemies!http://eaglerising.com/42260/forget-about-pelosi-and-schumer-these-three-are-trumps-real-enemies/  NESARA- Restore America – Galactic News








April 5, 2017 (Tony Cartalucci – NEO) – Eleven have been killed and dozens more injured in what is an apparent terrorist attack on St. Petersburg's metro system. Western analysts are assigning possible blame for the attack on either terrorists operating from Russia's Chechnya region, or possibly terrorist groups affiliated with fronts fighting in Syria. 

Western analysts are also attempting to cement a narrative that downplays the significance of the attacks and instead attempts to leverage them politically against Moscow. A piece in the Sydney Morning Herald titled, “Fears of a Putin crackdown after terror attack on St Petersburg metro,” would attempt to claim:
So who is to blame? No one has said officially. The BBC's Frank Gardner says suspicions will centre around Chechen nationalists or an Islamic State inspired group wanting payback for Putin's airstrikes in Syria. Or it could be a combination of both. Putin has in the past justified crackdowns on civilian protests by citing the terror threat. But will he this time, and will it work? 
At least one pro-Kremlin commentator has linked the attack to the recent mass demonstrations organised by Putin's political opponent. 
Yet, in reality, the demonstrations and the terrorist groups being implicated both share a significant common denominator – both are openly long-term recipients of US-European aid, with the latter group also receiving significant material support from US-European allies in the Persian Gulf, primarily Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
US-European support for foreign-funded organizations posing as “nongovernmental organizations” (NGOs) running parallel efforts with terrorist organizations undermining Moscow's control over Chechnya have been ongoing for decades.
Beyond Chechnya, the United States' own Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) would admit in a 2012 memo (PDF) that:
If the situation unravels there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran). 
The DIA memo then explains exactly who this “Salafist principality's” supporters are (and who its true enemies are):
The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition; while Russia, China, and Iran support the regime.
In essence, the “Salafist” (Islamic) “principality” (State) was a creation of the US in pursuit of its attempted regime change agenda in Syria. The current, self-proclaimed “Islamic State” is situated precisely in eastern Syria where the DIA memo claimed its state sponsors sought to place it. Its role in undermining Damascus and its allies' attempts to restore peace and order to the Syrian state is obvious.

The fact that NATO-member Turkey served as a logistical, training, and financial hub for not only the Islamic State's activities, but also other terrorist groups including Al Qaeda's regional franchise – Al Nusra – also further implicates not only possible Al Qaeda and Islamic State involvement in the recent St. Petersburg blast, but also these organizations' state sponsors – those who “support the opposition” in Syria.
Whether the United States played a direct role in the St. Petersburg blast or not is inconsequential. Without the massive state sponsorship both Washington and its European and Persian Gulf allies have provided these groups, such global-spanning mayhem would be impossible. The fact that the US seeks to undermine Russia politically, economically, and in many ways, militarily, and has recently fielded US-European-funded mobs in Russia's streets – means that it is likely not a coincidence violence is now also being employed against Russia within Russian territory.
As per US policymakers' own documented machinations – such as the 2009 Brookings Institution report, “Which Path to Persia?: Options for a New American Strategy Toward Iran” (PDF) - a militant component is prescribed as absolutely essential for the success of any street movement Washington manages to stir up against targeted states.
In the Brookings Institution document, it stated unequivocally in regards to toppling the government of Iran, that (emphasis added): 
Consequently, if the United States ever succeeds in sparking a revolt against the clerical regime, Washington may have to consider whether to provide it with some form of military support to prevent Tehran from crushing it. This requirement means that a popular revolution in Iran does not seem to fit the model of the “velvet revolutions” that occurred elsewhere. The point is that the Iranian regime may not be willing to go gently into that good night; instead, and unlike so many Eastern European regimes, it may choose to fight to the death. In those circumstances, if there is not external military assistance to the revolutionaries, they might not just fail but be massacred.   Consequently, if the United States is to pursue this policy, Washington must take this possibility into consideration. It adds some very important requirements to the list: either the policy must include ways to weaken the Iranian military or weaken the willingness of the regime’s leaders to call on the military, or else the United States must be ready to intervene to defeat it.”   
The policy document would also openly conspire to fund and arm listed terrorist organizations including the notorious Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK). The document would state: 
The United States could work with groups like the Iraq-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) and its military wing, the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), helping the thousands of its members who, under Saddam Husayn’s regime, were armed and had conducted guerrilla and terrorist operations against the clerical regime. Although the NCRI is supposedly disarmed today, that could quickly be changed.
It would also admit that (emphasis added):  
Despite its defenders’ claims, the MEK remains on the U.S. government list of foreign terrorist organizations. In the 1970s, the group killed three U.S. officers and three civilian contractors in Iran. During the 1979-1980 hostage crisis, the group praised the decision to take America hostages and Elaine Sciolino reported that while group leaders publicly condemned the 9/11 attacks, within the group celebrations were widespread. 
Undeniably, the group has conducted terrorist attacks—often excused by the MEK’s advocates because they are directed against the Iranian government. For example, in 1981, the group bombed the headquarters of the Islamic Republic Party, which was then the clerical leadership’s main political organization, killing an estimated 70 senior officials. More recently, the group has claimed credit for over a dozen mortar attacks, assassinations, and other assaults on Iranian civilian and military targets between 1998 and 2001. At the very least, to work more closely with the group (at least in an overt manner), Washington would need to remove it from the list of foreign terrorist organizations. 
If US policymakers have openly conspired to arm and fund known terrorist organizations guilty of murdering not only civilians in nations like Iran but also citizens of the United States itself, why would they hesitate to do likewise in Russia?
While the US poses as engaged in a battle against the so-called “Islamic State” in Syria, it has left its obvious, overt state sponsors unscathed both politically and financially.  If the bombing in St. Petersburg is linked to US-European-Persian Gulf state sponsored terrorism, it will be only the latest in a long and bloody tradition of using terrorism as a geopolitical  tool.
The US, having been frustrated in Syria and having little to no leverage at the negotiation table, is likely trying to “show” Moscow that it can still create chaos both beyond Russia's borders amongst its allies, and within Russia's borders – regardless of how well Russians have weathered such tactics in the past.

The recent terrorist events in St. Petersburg were a warning to Trump of what will come to every American state if he continues to resist the Deep State. Yes, that is correct, my best source informed me last night that his intel suggests that this whole terrorist operation in St. Petersburg was designed to serve as a warning Trump about what will come here if his administration does not stop resisting.
If St. Petersburg comes to America, America will be forced into martial law and a suspension of all rights. This article speaks to what will happen under martial law, regardless of who is President. This article also reveals the price of inaction on the part of the American people. Ask yourself a question America, “If you are going to get your backside kicked, shouldn’t you might as well go down fighting”?
The Coming Martial Law
With everything I have uncovered over the past several years, I have concluded that America will be thrust into martial law prior to fighting in WW III. Martial law is usually preceded by a false flag. There is no shortage of false flag possibilities and choosing the manner, the time and the place is a fool’s errand. However, there are a definitive 17 elements of martial law that we can analyze in order to gauge the progress America is making with regard to to being under total martial law. And it does not matter if Trump, or Obama, is President, the result is always the same.
Being aware of an unfolding state of martial law can help one adjust to changing circumstances. Many experts that I speak with firmly believe that we will not see an all-encompassing declaration of martial. Rather, the elements of martial will be imposed individually and will be referred to as “Continuity of Government”, which most likely follow a significant false flag attack.
Whether martial law is declared all at once, or in piecemeal fashion, there are 17 elements of martial law that all Americans need to be aware of. When, not if, the coordinated terror attacks occur on our soil, the following is what you can expect.

1-Mass roundup of political dissidents. These will most likely be declared as terrorists and enemies of the state and will be linked to the precipitating false flag event.
2-Dusk to dawn curfews which are designed to keep the people from congregating and planning in concert to overthrow the omnipresent tyranny.
3-Rationing of essential resources.
4-The seizing of personal assets such as food and water.  
5-Control over all food and water 
6-The prohibition of weapons of any kind including guns, knives or chemicals which can be turned into explosives. It will become a capital crime to possess a weapon of any type.
7-The confiscation of property, homes and businesses 
8-Arrests without due process (NDAA).
9-Massive “papers please” checkpoints with intrusive searches. Please note that Disney visitors now have to submit to TSA groping.
10-Forced relocation of suspected American dissidents as specified by the Civilian Inmate Labor Program and the Civilian Conscription Program.
11-Forced conscription into various labor camps and even into the military. Also medical martial law policies could be invoked in the advent of the introduction of a pathogen
12-Outlawing of free speech. Following recent terror attacks.
13-The installation of massive surveillance programs and the establishment of snitch programs which would mark the rebirth of former Secretary of DHS, Janet Napolitano, in which neighbors are encouraged to “say something, if these see something”. The NSA police state surveillance programs speak for themselves. It is highly recommended that every American see the Oliver Stone movie, Snowden. 
14-The total control or elimination of religion. The Bible is already being characterized as hate speech. Today, one who is Christian is cast as anti-gay/transgender, anti-government, etc.
15-Control of the media. Except for the total eradication of the alternative media, this has already happened. ICANN will finish the job. 
16-Executions without due process of law (NDAA).
17-Total suspension of the Constitution.

As an aside, if you want to see what this looks like, watch the TV series, Colony, from the beginning.
President Trump does not want these things to occur. However, if he is to maintain order, he many not have a choice in the near future, if he is going to protect America from ongoing false flag events.
Conclusion
I firmly believe in the accuracy of  what I was told in that the St. Petersburg bombings were a contrived warning to Trump to keep him in line for the time being. However, and regardless of Trump’s complicity in silence and inaction, this will still be America’s ultimate fate. We presently have a plethora of terrorist cells, acknowledged by FBI Director, James Comey, in every state, simply awaiting orders to spring into action. I have previously discussed the distinct possibility of a TET offensive in America. The events in Russia were merely the first salvo in the next campaign of globalist subjugation of the American people.
The bottom line is, how can Trump move his agenda forward without support from the people? What is happening to the Trump administration is our fault. Trump needed us to put constant pressure on Congress and make them afraid to do what they are presently doing to Trump, which is paralyzing his administration. This is not Trump’s fault, this is your fault and my fault.  Trump needed us to expose the criminal element of the Deep State.  We got Trump elected and have gone back to sleep.  We are defeated, and the above represents our future if we do not get back to work. And event then, this whole thing could easily descend into revolution and martial law.
How many of these 17 elements are in place, or, are being put into place? All 17 elements are at various stages of already being implemented and it commenced under Obama. The right crisis will precipitate the completion of these elements of martial law in their totality. Knowing the signs of unfolding martial law should serve as a trigger to prepare and maintain as low of a profile as possible. The more resources that you have stored, the less likely you will be to cross the line into a government facility in order to feed you family (i.e. a FEMA camp).
In summary, these 17 elements are being put into place in order to pave the way for the purge that will follow an United Nations takeover and we have nobody to blame but ourselves..

The recent terrorist events in St. Petersburg were a warning to Trump of what will come to every American state if he continues to resist the Deep State. Yes, that is correct, my best source informed me last night that his intel suggests that this whole terrorist operation in St. Petersburg was designed to serve as a warning Trump about what will come here if his administration does not stop resisting.If St. Petersburg comes to America, America will be forced into martial law and a suspension of all rights. This article speaks to what will happen under martial law, regardless of who is President. This article also reveals the price of inaction on the part of the American people. Ask yourself a question America, “If you are going to get your backside kicked, shouldn’t you might as well go down fighting”?With everything I have uncovered over the past several years, I have concluded that America will be thrust into martial law prior to fighting in WW III. Martial law is usually preceded by a false flag. There is no shortage of false flag possibilities and choosing the manner, the time and the place is a fool’s errand. However, there are a definitive 17 elements of martial law that we can analyze in order to gauge the progress America is making with regard to to being under total martial law. And it does not matter if Trump, or Obama, is President, the result is always the same.Being aware of an unfolding state of martial law can help one adjust to changing circumstances. Many experts that I speak with firmly believe that we will not see an all-encompassing declaration of martial. Rather, the elements of martial will be imposed individually and will be referred to as “Continuity of Government”, which most likely follow a significant false flag attack.Whether martial law is declared all at once, or in piecemeal fashion, there are 17 elements of martial law that all Americans need to be aware of. When, not if, the coordinated terror attacks occur on our soil, the following is what you can expect.1-Mass roundup of political dissidents. These will most likely be declared as terrorists and enemies of the state and will be linked to the precipitating false flag event.2-Dusk to dawn curfews which are designed to keep the people from congregating and planning in concert to overthrow the omnipresent tyranny.3-Rationing of essential resources.4-The seizing of personal assets such as food and water.  5-Control over all food and water 6-The prohibition of weapons of any kind including guns, knives or chemicals which can be turned into explosives. It will become a capital crime to possess a weapon of any type.7-The confiscation of property, homes and businesses 8-Arrests without due process (NDAA).9-Massive “papers please” checkpoints with intrusive searches. Please note that Disney visitors now have to submit to TSA groping.10-Forced relocation of suspected American dissidents as specified by the Civilian Inmate Labor Program and the Civilian Conscription Program.11-Forced conscription into various labor camps and even into the military. Also medical martial law policies could be invoked in the advent of the introduction of a pathogen12-Outlawing of free speech. Following recent terror attacks.13-The installation of massive surveillance programs and the establishment of snitch programs which would mark the rebirth of former Secretary of DHS, Janet Napolitano, in which neighbors are encouraged to “say something, if these see something”. The NSA police state surveillance programs speak for themselves. It is highly recommended that every American see the Oliver Stone movie, Snowden. 14-The total control or elimination of religion. The Bible is already being characterized as hate speech. Today, one who is Christian is cast as anti-gay/transgender, anti-government, etc.15-Control of the media. Except for the total eradication of the alternative media, this has already happened. ICANN will finish the job. 16-Executions without due process of law (NDAA).17-Total suspension of the Constitution.As an aside, if you want to see what this looks like, watch the TV series, Colony, from the beginning.President Trump does not want these things to occur. However, if he is to maintain order, he many not have a choice in the near future, if he is going to protect America from ongoing false flag events.I firmly believe in the accuracy of  what I was told in that the St. Petersburg bombings were a contrived warning to Trump to keep him in line for the time being. However, and regardless of Trump’s complicity in silence and inaction, this will still be America’s ultimate fate. We presently have a plethora of terrorist cells, acknowledged by FBI Director, James Comey, in every state, simply awaiting orders to spring into action.

There were a number of U.S. intelligence officers during the fierce presidential race who blew the whistle on President Barack Obama’s playing loose and fancy free with his reports on his “war on extremism” that should have not only outraged reporters and news editors, but opened the door to the appointment of a special prosecutor.  Both Obama and Clinton are on record saying the Muslim Brotherhood is a moderate group.Unfortunately, since it was a Democratic president with a leftist political philosophy and a “blame America first” mentality, the nation’s purveyors of information ignored the story or relegated the reports to the back pages of newspapers. And to this day, the “Magnificent 50” intelligence analysts have not seen their loyalty to the U.S. Constitution and to the American people even acknowledged.The more than four dozen U.S. intelligence analysts formally filed complaints that their honest intelligence evaluations regarding the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al-Qaida’s branch Al Nusra Front in Syria were altered by superiors to prop up President Barack Obama’s false proclamations that he and his “national security team” are winning the war.As previously reported in the Conservative Base, Fox News’ Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge was informed by her anonymous but reliable source, who is an associate of the CENTCOM intelligence analysts, that they were instructed to avoid negative reports. In fact, they received two emails saying the analysts needed to “cut it out” and “toe the line,” when submitting reports. In an earlier report published by the Conservative Base, it was reported that some of the intelligence community’s top analysts informed the Pentagon’s official watchdog that their reports have been systematically edited to backup President Obama’s — and his national security team’s — false narrative in which they claimed the air campaign against ISIS is more successful than it actually is.Gen. Lloyd Austin, US Army Ret.An example of this alleged fraud was the sworn testimony of General Lloyd Austin, commander of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Gen. Austin testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that a multi-million dollar military program that was supposed to train a large number of Syrian rebels — about 1,000 was the number circulated by the White House — to fight ISIS resulted in producing an embarrassing  four or five anti-ISIS fighters for front lines.   According to the general’s testimony, American taxpayers are pouring an estimated $9 million per day on the war against ISIS since August 2014 and we have only Obama’s almost constant self-congratulations and amateur comedy act poking fun at those who point out the abysmal results of his foreign policy in the Middle East.Two of the intelligence analysts assigned to the U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, wrote an official complaint and sent it to the Defense Department’s inspector general in July accusing their superiors of doctoring up their reports to make it appear that the Obama administration is winning against ISIS. Since then, more than 50 analysts given their own complaints in the hopes that someone in the U.S. government takes action. Some of those 50 analysts are officially employed by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and others are contractors.Their complaints accuse their superiors that at times key elements contained in their intelligence reports were removed. They said that in the end an intelligence assessment did not reflect the analysts’ conclusions.Unfortunately, the reports by Fox News’ Catherine Herridge, the Conservative Base and other news and commentary publications aren’t the whole story of deception and fraud. The complaints go far beyond alleged altering of reports. Some of the complaints have to do with accusations that some senior leaders at CENTCOM created an unprofessional and hostile work environment.One source who is very familiar with the contents of one of the written complaints sent to the inspector general claims that the word “Stalinist” was used to describe officials overseeing CENTCOM’s intelligence analysis. “Although the analysts should be praised for not only coming forward as whistleblowers, but they should also be congratulated for blowing the whistle in a mature and constructive manner. This is one of the worst allegations of government corruption I’ve heard about since the days of Richard M. Nixon and Watergate,” said former military intelligence operative and police detective unit commander Franklyn Lovell, Jr.“There’s only one problem: the reporters in the early 1970s despised Nixon and were more than happy to bash him, but the news media today loves Obama and although they will publish or air negative stories about him, they don’t want to see him fail. In fact, I will bet that these reporters already wrote their ‘comeback kid’ news stories in anticipation that nothing will come of any of the scandals in the Obama administration,” said Lovell.https://conservativebase.com/intelligence-agents-blow-their-whistles-on-obamas-phony-reports-and-fake-news/Jim Kouri, CPP, is founder and CEO of Kouri Associates, a homeland security, public safety and political consulting firm.

From Paul BegleyBreaking: Syria Sarin Gas Attack Kills 58 Wounds 300 “Today the news is awful,” Mogherini said in an interview with media organizations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria.“But this is a dramatic reminder that the situation on the ground continues to be dramatic in many parts of Syria,” Mogherini said.“Obviously there is a primary responsibility there of the regime because it has responsibility of protecting its people not attacking its people.”Following the attack, France called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault described the attack as “monstrous” and added: “I have called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.”Ayrault said “chemical weapons” had been used in the attack and that it was “more proof of the savagery that the Syrian people have been subjected to for so many years.”The attack in the town of Khan Sheikhun left dozens struggling to breathe and displaying symptoms such as foaming at the mouth and vomiting and fainting, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.A hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims of the attack was also bombarded, an AFP correspondent said.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a phone call that the chemical weapons attack was “inhuman” and could endanger peace talks based in the Kazakh capital.“President Erdogan said that this kind of inhuman attack was unacceptable and warned it risked wasting all the efforts within the framework of the Astana process” to bring peace to Syria, presidential sources said.The sources did not indicate who was to blame for the attack, describing it as a “chemical weapons attack directed at civilians.”    READ MORE

From The X22 ReportThe Financial System Will Go Dark When The Economic System Fails








Mike Whitney has written an excellent expose of the “Russiagate” cover story for Obama’s political use of national security to help his party oppose Republicans.Covert surveillance of politicians on Obama’s Nixon-like “Enemies List” has been going on for many years, but is only now being unmasked as a result of the failure of Obama’s cover story–“We weren’t spying on political opponents; only on Russians to protect America.”The presstitute media has passed on the cover story authored by former Obama-administration officials led by CIA director John Brennan, FBI director James Comey, the DNC, and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff. The loose ends in this cover-up have now been so widely exposed as hearsay and political that only 13% of Republicans believe the fact-free story – but 67% of Democrats cling to it.Whitney reports that Comey began the investigation in July 2016. As of last Friday (March 31, 2017) not a scrap of evidence has turned up. This did not deter Comey from telling Congress that Putin “hated Secretary Clinton so much that the flip side of that coin was that he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much.” So the Russians allegedly “engaged in a multifaceted campaign to undermine our democracy.”Comey based this conclusion on what has become a hilarious bit of gullibililty. The Russians, he said “were unusually loud in their intervention. It’s almost as if they didn’t care that we knew, that they wanted us to see what they were doing.”Alternatively, someone wanted investigators to infer that the Russians were doing the hacking. As Wikeleaks Vault 7 releases prove, the CIA can hack computers and leave anyone else’s signature. Due to poor security, the CIA’s cybertechnology ended up in the Internet domain.“They’ll be back. They’ll be back, in 2020. They may be back in 2018,” warned Mr. Comey. But who is the “they”? “They” seem to be “us,” or at least what numerous former national security officials have suggested: either the NSC, CIA or its “Five Eyes” partner, British MI6.Wall Street Journal editorialist Kimberley A. Strassel poses the real question: Why hasn’t the Trump administration had the Secret Service to arrest Comey, Brennan, Schiff, the DNC and Hillary for trying to overthrow the President of the United States? “Mr. Nunes has said he has seen proof that the Obama White House surveilled the incoming administration—on subjects that had nothing to do with Russia—and that it further unmasked (identified by name) transition officials. This goes far beyond a mere scandal. It’s a potential crime.”What we are watching is turning out to be traces of a plot against a government elected by the American people. Attempts to get at the truth by House national security committee Chairman Devin Nunes have been countered with demands by Democrats to recuse himself so as to stop his exposé of how “Team Obama was spying broadly on the incoming administration.”It seems that this has been going on for many years now. Former Rep. Dennis Kucinich has dropped a bombshell about what appears to be his own illegal surveillance under Obama’s NSC. “When the president raised the question of wiretapping on his phones in Trump Tower, he was challenged to prove that such a thing could happen. It happened to me.”Here’s what happened, which was revealed two years after he left office in 2013 when the Democrats were overjoyed to see Ohio Republicans redraw the election district lines to get rid of his candidacy. The Washington Times asked him to authenticate a secret recording of a cell phone call “from Saif el-Islam Qaddafi, a high-ranking official in Libya’s government and a son of the country’s ruler, Moammar Qaddafi.”Before taking the call, Rep. Kucinich “checked with the House’s general counsel to ensure that such a discussion by a member of Congress with a foreign power was permitted by law.”“I was assured that under the Constitution a lawmaker had a fundamental duty to ask questions and gather information—activity expressly protected by the Article I clauses covering separation of powers and congressional speech and debate.”Given the quality of the recordings was excellent on both ends of the call, Kucinich concluded that “the tape was made by an American intelligence agency and then leaked to the Times for political reasons. If so, this episode represented a gross violation of the separation of powers.”His repeated Freedom of Information Act requests made in 2012 before leaving office have been stonewalled by the intelligence agencies for five years.We are now in a position to see the real story behind “Russiagate.” It’s not about Russia. The real news is the Obama regime’s abuse of the government’s surveillance powers to spy on Donald Trump and other Republicans in order to build a dossier for the DNC to leak to the press in an attempt to slander or compromise Trump and throw the election to Hillary.They’ve been caught, but we can now see that they took steps to protect themselves against this. They prepared a cover story. They pretend they were not spying on Trump, but on Russians – which only by fortuitous happenchance turned up alleged incriminating smoke against Trump.This cover story was buttressed by the fake news story prepared by former MI6 freelancer Christopher Steele. As Whitney reports, Steele “was hired as an opposition researcher last June to dig up derogatory information on Donald Trump.” Unvetted and unverified information by so-called informants somehow found its way into U.S. intelligence agency reports. These reports were then leaked to Democrat-friendly media. This is where the crime lies. Obama regime and DNC were using these agencies for domestic political use, KGB style.The Obama/Clinton cover story is now falling to pieces. That explains the desperation in the attack by Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, on Committee Chairman Devin Nunes to stop the exposure. Russiagate is not a Trump/Putin collusion but a domestic spy job carried out by Democrats.Law requires Trump to arrest those responsible and to put them on trial for treason and conspiracy to overthrow the government of the United States. If Trump fears to prosecute the Obama operatives within the Deep State, they will try all the harder to attack him to the point of forcing his removal or at least discrediting him and his fellow Republicans to pave the way for the 2018 elections.paulcraigroberts.orghttp://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2017/04/04/real-russiagate-obama-stasi-state.htmlMore great articles here: http://www.strategic-culture.org

Vitamin C, B1 and Hydrocortisone Dramatically Reduce Mortality From Sepsis











By Dr. Mercola
Sepsis1 is a progressive disease process caused by an aggressive, dysfunctional immune response to an infection in the bloodstream. It starts with symptoms of infection that can progress to septic shock.
Unless treated — and the earlier the better — sepsis can result in extremely low blood pressure that is unresponsive to fluid replacement, weakening of the heart, and multiple-organ failure.
Sepsis is a common hospital-acquired infection,2,3 but common illnesses such as bronchitis, pneumonia, strep throat or kidney infection can also turn septic, as can localized infections caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses.
The condition becomes particularly problematic and deadly if the infection involves methicillin-resistant or vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA or VRSA) bacteria.
Each year, an estimated 1 million Americans get sepsis4 and up to half of them die.5,6,7 Treatment can be a challenge, and is becoming even more so as drug-resistant infections become more prevalent.
According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, sepsis is the most expensive condition being treated in U.S. hospitals, costing more than $20 billion in 20118 and $24 billion in 2014.9
The good news is a critical care physician just may have found a way to save tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars each year using two readily available vitamins and a steroid.
Vitamin C and Thiamin — An Inexpensive Cure for Sepsis
Vitamin C is well-known for its ability to prevent and treat infectious diseases. Previous research has shown it effectively lowers pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein.10,11,12 Influenza,13 encephalitis and measles14 have all been successfully treated with high-dose vitamin C.
Studies have even shown vitamin C is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells by generating hydrogen peroxide when administered intravenously (IV) in high doses. It also has a number of heart and cardiovascular benefits.
The anti-infective power of vitamin C has now been demonstrated yet again by Dr. Paul Marik, a critical care doctor at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in East Virginia.
Last January, when faced with yet another deathly ill patient, Marik decided to try a combination of intravenous (IV) vitamin C with hydrocortisone as a last-ditch effort to save the woman’s life.15
He’d recently read a colleague’s paper on vitamin C, and he knew vitamin C acts like the steroid hydrocortisone, so on a hunch, he administered the two together. It worked. While everyone expected her to die, the woman made a remarkable overnight recovery. As reported by NBC4i News:16

“The staff couldn’t believe it, so they tried it again and again — with the same results. They added a third element, thiamine, to the IV treatment as well. Today, they have used the treatment on about 150 patients and they say the result is the same …


A researcher at Old Dominion University, John Catravas, Ph.D., … did an independent lab study that confirms the treatment’s effectiveness.”

Interestingly, Marik used a relatively small amount of vitamin C — only 1.5 grams IV. Most natural medicine physicians tend to use 25 grams or more when giving IV vitamin C, more than 20 times the dose used here. One can only wonder how much more effective a larger dose would be.
It’s All About the Right Combination of Ingredients

For the first two or three patients, only vitamin C and hydrocortisone were used. Marik then decided to add thiamine for a number of reasons. Importantly, it’s required for metabolism of some of the metabolites of vitamin C.
Research has also shown many patients with sepsis are vitamin deficient, and when thiamine is given, it reduces mortality. Septic shock patients who receive thiamine have also been shown to have a reduced risk of renal failure.
Marik’s retrospective before-after clinical study,17,18 published in the journal Chest, showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and thiamine (vitamin B1) for two days reduced mortality nearly five-fold, from 40 percent to 8.5 percent.
Of the 50 patients treated, only four died — and none of them actually died from sepsis. They died from their underlying disease.
Interestingly, further lab testing found that while neither vitamin C nor hydrocortisone alone are able to prevent cell death following exposure to toxins produced by bacteria, when given in combination, the concoction does protect the cells. Turns out Marik’s hunch had been a truly inspired one.
Other research has also shown thiamine reduces mortality from sepsis and helps protect against renal failure, which is why Marik decided to add it to his mixture.
The treatment has now become part of the hospital’s standard of care for sepsis, and will hopefully become standard of care for sepsis elsewhere as well. As noted by Marik, sepsis kills about 1,000 people each day in the U.S. — that’s like having three jumbo jets crash each day.
Sepsis kills more than breast cancer, colon cancer and AIDS combined, and here’s a treatment that is not only profoundly effective, but also has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer. Patients and doctors really have nothing to lose by trying it.
Potential Contraindication
While more research is needed to validate the findings, vitamin C and thiamine (vitamin B1) administration is so safe there’s really no need to avoid it. It certainly isn’t going to make the situation worse — unless you happen to be glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient (a genetic disorder).19
G6PD is an enzyme your red blood cells need to maintain membrane integrity. High-dose IV vitamin C is a strong pro-oxidant, and giving a pro-oxidant to a G6PD-deficient individual can cause their red blood cells to rupture, which could have disastrous consequences.
Fortunately, G6PC deficiency is relatively uncommon, and can be tested for. People of Mediterranean and African decent are at greater risk of being G6PC deficient. Worldwide, G6PD deficiency is thought to affect 400 million individuals, and in the U.S., an estimated 1 in 10 African American males have it.20
Anecdotal Evidence Suggests Near-Infrared Light May Protect Against Kidney Failure
On a side note, your risk of kidney failure — which is a very common outcome of sepsis — may be reduced or prevented by shining a near-infrared light on the area. I know, that sounds too amazing to be true, but according to Michael Hamblin, Ph.D., a photodynamic therapy researcher, the anecdotal evidence for this is quite strong.

“Kidney failure is the third leading cause of death. These are old folks who are dying from kidney failure. You can’t really give them transplants because they’re elderly. You put a near-infrared LED array where their kidneys are and it seems to work like a dream. [But] it’s hardly been studied at all,” Hamblin said. Again, the worst that could happen is nothing, as red and near-infrared light (630 to 830 nanometer range) is quite safe.

Other Health Benefits of Thiamine
Thiamine or vitamin B1,21 found in pork, dark leafy greens, wheat germ, green peas, lentils and nuts,22 is perhaps best known for its role in cellular production of energy and supporting normal neuronal activity. However, it also has a wide range of other health benefits.23 According to the Mayo Clinic, studies confirm thiamine can be helpful for a long list of diseases and disorders, including:24

Metabolic and mitochondrial disorders
Blood clots and clogged arteries
Cerebellar ataxia (movement disorder caused by neurological damage)
Coma
Kidney dysfunction

Research25 published in 2013 also found thiamine supplementation can improve cardiac function in those with heart failure. Overall, patients with heart failure tend to be deficient in thiamine, as well as other micronutrients. Thiamine deficiency has also been linked to delirium,26 thyroid fatigue and Hashimoto’s (a thyroid autoimmune disorder).27 These and other health effects may help explain why thiamine works so well (in conjunction with vitamin C and hydrocortisone) for sepsis.
For general health purposes, adult men and women need about 1.2 and 1.1 milligrams (mg) of thiamine respectively each day. Also be aware that thiamine conversion is dependent on having sufficient amounts of sulfur. Good sources of dietary sulfur include organic pastured eggs, legumes, garlic, onion, Brussel sprouts, asparagus, kale and wheat germ.
Moreover, all B vitamins, including thiamine, are produced within your gut28 provided you have a healthy gut microbiome. So, eating real food, ideally organic, along with fermented foods will provide your microbiome with important fiber and beneficial bacteria to help optimize your internal vitamin B production.
To Avoid Sepsis, Understand the Cause
With sepsis affecting more than a million Americans each year, how can you avoid becoming a statistic? First, be aware that ANY infection can lead to sepsis. While it’s typically associated with hospital-acquired infections, nearly half of all cases are in fact the result of an infection acquired outside a hospital setting.29
Part of what makes it so deadly is that people typically do not suspect it, and the longer you wait to treat it, the deadlier it gets. As noted in a special report on sepsis by Consumer Reports:30

“Whenever the body develops an infection, the immune system normally kicks in, producing chemicals to fight the infection. But sometimes — either because the triggering bacteria is unusually powerful or because the person’s immune system is already weakened by other health problems — those chemicals are set loose in the bloodstream and course through the body.


Instead of just fighting the local infection, those chemicals unleashed by the immune system cause widespread inflammation and damage tissues in the liver, kidneys, heart and other organs. Within hours, blood clots can begin to form, and damage to blood vessels causes blood pressure to drop, which in turn slows the delivery of vital nutrients to those organs already under attack. In the final stages, the heart weakens and organs begin to fail.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you’re at higher risk for sepsis if you have:

Chronic disease. A vast majority — 7 out of 10 — of people who develop sepsis have some kind of chronic health condition. Those with diabetes, lung, kidney or liver disease tend to be particularly susceptible to infection, which raises the risk.
Weakened immune system, AIDS or cancer.
Recently spent time in a hospital, nursing home or other health care facility, as exposure to infection-causing bacteria is common in these places.

Common Sense Strategies to Reduce Your Risk of Sepsis
While health care workers have a responsibility to prevent infections that could potentially turn septic and to educate patients about warning signs of sepsis, you can lower your own risk by:
Promptly treating urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs are the second most common type of infection in the body, sending more than 8 million people to their health care providers every year in the U.S. alone,31 and one-quarter of sepsis cases are related to urinary tract infections.
Conventional treatment typically involves antibiotics, but research shows 90 percent of UTIs can be successfully treated with D-Mannose, a naturally occurring sugar that’s closely related to glucose. To learn more, see “D-Mannose for UTI Prevention Validated in a Clinical Trial.”

•Properly clean skin wounds. About 1 in 10 sepsis cases are due to skin infections, so always take the time to properly clean and care for wounds and scrapes. Wash the wound with mild soap and water to clean out dirt and debris, then cover with a sterile bandage. Diabetics should follow good foot care to avoid dangerous foot infections.
•Avoid infections in hospitals. When visiting a health care facility, be sure to wash your own hands, and remind doctors and nurses to wash theirs (and/or change gloves) before touching you or any equipment being used on you.
If you have to undergo a colonoscopy or other testing using a flexible medical scope, remember to call and ask how they clean their scopes and what kind of cleaning solution they use. If the answer is glutaraldehyde (brand name Cidex), find another hospital or clinic — one that uses peracetic acid. This preliminary legwork will significantly decrease your risk of contracting an infection from a contaminated scope.
In the video below, Andrew Saul, Ph.D., co-author of the book, “Hospitals and Health: Your Orthomolecular Guide to a Shorter, Safer Hospital Stay,” discusses the dangers of hospital stays, the type of patient that tends to get killed the most, and how you can protect your health and life in the event you have to spend time in a hospital.

By Dr. MercolaSepsis1 is a progressive disease process caused by an aggressive, dysfunctional immune response to an infection in the bloodstream. It starts with symptoms of infection that can progress to septic shock.Unless treated — and the earlier the better — sepsis can result in extremely low blood pressure that is unresponsive to fluid replacement, weakening of the heart, and multiple-organ failure.Sepsis is a common hospital-acquired infection,2,3 but common illnesses such as bronchitis, pneumonia, strep throat or kidney infection can also turn septic, as can localized infections caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses.The condition becomes particularly problematic and deadly if the infection involves methicillin-resistant or vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA or VRSA) bacteria.Each year, an estimated 1 million Americans get sepsis4 and up to half of them die.5,6,7 Treatment can be a challenge, and is becoming even more so as drug-resistant infections become more prevalent.According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, sepsis is the most expensive condition being treated in U.S. hospitals, costing more than $20 billion in 20118 and $24 billion in 2014.9The good news is a critical care physician just may have found a way to save tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars each year using two readily available vitamins and a steroid.Vitamin C and Thiamin — An Inexpensive Cure for SepsisVitamin C is well-known for its ability to prevent and treat infectious diseases. Previous research has shown it effectively lowers pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein.10,11,12 Influenza,13 encephalitis and measles14 have all been successfully treated with high-dose vitamin C.Studies have even shown vitamin C is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells by generating hydrogen peroxide when administered intravenously (IV) in high doses. It also has a number of heart and cardiovascular benefits.The anti-infective power of vitamin C has now been demonstrated yet again by Dr. Paul Marik, a critical care doctor at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in East Virginia.Last January, when faced with yet another deathly ill patient, Marik decided to try a combination of intravenous (IV) vitamin C with hydrocortisone as a last-ditch effort to save the woman’s life.15He’d recently read a colleague’s paper on vitamin C, and he knew vitamin C acts like the steroid hydrocortisone, so on a hunch, he administered the two together. It worked. While everyone expected her to die, the woman made a remarkable overnight recovery. As reported by NBC4i News:16“The staff couldn’t believe it, so they tried it again and again — with the same results. They added a third element, thiamine, to the IV treatment as well. Today, they have used the treatment on about 150 patients and they say the result is the same …A researcher at Old Dominion University, John Catravas, Ph.D., … did an independent lab study that confirms the treatment’s effectiveness.”Interestingly, Marik used a relatively small amount of vitamin C — only 1.5 grams IV. Most natural medicine physicians tend to use 25 grams or more when giving IV vitamin C, more than 20 times the dose used here. One can only wonder how much more effective a larger dose would be.It’s All About the Right Combination of IngredientsFor the first two or three patients, only vitamin C and hydrocortisone were used. Marik then decided to add thiamine for a number of reasons. Importantly, it’s required for metabolism of some of the metabolites of vitamin C.Research has also shown many patients with sepsis are vitamin deficient, and when thiamine is given, it reduces mortality. Septic shock patients who receive thiamine have also been shown to have a reduced risk of renal failure.Marik’s retrospective before-after clinical study,17,18 published in the journal Chest, showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and thiamine (vitamin B1) for two days reduced mortality nearly five-fold, from 40 percent to 8.5 percent.Of the 50 patients treated, only four died — and none of them actually died from sepsis. They died from their underlying disease.Interestingly, further lab testing found that while neither vitamin C nor hydrocortisone alone are able to prevent cell death following exposure to toxins produced by bacteria, when given in combination, the concoction does protect the cells. Turns out Marik’s hunch had been a truly inspired one.Other research has also shown thiamine reduces mortality from sepsis and helps protect against renal failure, which is why Marik decided to add it to his mixture.The treatment has now become part of the hospital’s standard of care for sepsis, and will hopefully become standard of care for sepsis elsewhere as well. As noted by Marik, sepsis kills about 1,000 people each day in the U.S. — that’s like having three jumbo jets crash each day.Sepsis kills more than breast cancer, colon cancer and AIDS combined, and here’s a treatment that is not only profoundly effective, but also has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer. Patients and doctors really have nothing to lose by trying it.Potential ContraindicationWhile more research is needed to validate the findings, vitamin C and thiamine (vitamin B1) administration is so safe there’s really no need to avoid it. It certainly isn’t going to make the situation worse — unless you happen to be glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient (a genetic disorder).19G6PD is an enzyme your red blood cells need to maintain membrane integrity. High-dose IV vitamin C is a strong pro-oxidant, and giving a pro-oxidant to a G6PD-deficient individual can cause their red blood cells to rupture, which could have disastrous consequences.Fortunately, G6PC deficiency is relatively uncommon, and can be tested for. People of Mediterranean and African decent are at greater risk of being G6PC deficient. Worldwide, G6PD deficiency is thought to affect 400 million individuals, and in the U.S., an estimated 1 in 10 African American males have it.20Anecdotal Evidence Suggests Near-Infrared Light May Protect Against Kidney FailureOn a side note, your risk of kidney failure — which is a very common outcome of sepsis — may be reduced or prevented by shining a near-infrared light on the area. I know, that sounds too amazing to be true, but according to Michael Hamblin, Ph.D., a photodynamic therapy researcher, the anecdotal evidence for this is quite strong.“Kidney failure is the third leading cause of death. These are old folks who are dying from kidney failure. You can’t really give them transplants because they’re elderly. You put a near-infrared LED array where their kidneys are and it seems to work like a dream. [But] it’s hardly been studied at all,” Hamblin said. Again, the worst that could happen is nothing, as red and near-infrared light (630 to 830 nanometer range) is quite safe.Other Health Benefits of ThiamineThiamine or vitamin B1,21 found in pork, dark leafy greens, wheat germ, green peas, lentils and nuts,22 is perhaps best known for its role in cellular production of energy and supporting normal neuronal activity. However, it also has a wide range of other health benefits.23 According to the Mayo Clinic, studies confirm thiamine can be helpful for a long list of diseases and disorders, including:24Research25 published in 2013 also found thiamine supplementation can improve cardiac function in those with heart failure. Overall, patients with heart failure tend to be deficient in thiamine, as well as other micronutrients. Thiamine deficiency has also been linked to delirium,26 thyroid fatigue and Hashimoto’s (a thyroid autoimmune disorder).27 These and other health effects may help explain why thiamine works so well (in conjunction with vitamin C and hydrocortisone) for sepsis.For general health purposes, adult men and women need about 1.2 and 1.1 milligrams (mg) of thiamine respectively each day. Also be aware that thiamine conversion is dependent on having sufficient amounts of sulfur. Good sources of dietary sulfur include organic pastured eggs, legumes, garlic, onion, Brussel sprouts, asparagus, kale and wheat germ.Moreover, all B vitamins, including thiamine, are produced within your gut28 provided you have a healthy gut microbiome. So, eating real food, ideally organic, along with fermented foods will provide your microbiome with important fiber and beneficial bacteria to help optimize your internal vitamin B production.To Avoid Sepsis, Understand the CauseWith sepsis affecting more than a million Americans each year, how can you avoid becoming a statistic? First, be aware that ANY infection can lead to sepsis. While it’s typically associated with hospital-acquired infections, nearly half of all cases are in fact the result of an infection acquired outside a hospital setting.29Part of what makes it so deadly is that people typically do not suspect it, and the longer you wait to treat it, the deadlier it gets. As noted in a special report on sepsis by Consumer Reports:30“Whenever the body develops an infection, the immune system normally kicks in, producing chemicals to fight the infection. But sometimes — either because the triggering bacteria is unusually powerful or because the person’s immune system is already weakened by other health problems — those chemicals are set loose in the bloodstream and course through the body.Instead of just fighting the local infection, those chemicals unleashed by the immune system cause widespread inflammation and damage tissues in the liver, kidneys, heart and other organs. Within hours, blood clots can begin to form, and damage to blood vessels causes blood pressure to drop, which in turn slows the delivery of vital nutrients to those organs already under attack. In the final stages, the heart weakens and organs begin to fail.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you’re at higher risk for sepsis if you have:Common Sense Strategies to Reduce Your Risk of SepsisWhile health care workers have a responsibility to prevent infections that could potentially turn septic and to educate patients about warning signs of sepsis, you can lower your own risk by:Promptly treating urinary tract infections (UTIs).

For instance, Americans consume an average of 150 Ibs of sugar per year. Besides leading to obesity, diabetes and cancer, high amounts of sugar can also cause nutrient deficiency and reduces the absorption of essential vitamins and minerals needed by the body.The consumption of too much sugar prevents the absorption of vitamin C since they both use the same transporters in order to reach the cells. In other words, increased glucose levels inhibit vitamin C from entering the cells which results in limited vitamin absorption. Furthermore, this leads to suppressed tissue regeneration and decreased immune function.
Sugar can also degrade vitamin D since it decreases the enzymes needed to synthesize this vitamin, which leads to vitamin D deficiency. Unfortunately, this condition leads to dementia, inflammation, infections, cancer and autoimmunity.The consumption of too much sugar causes high blood sugar and increases insulin levels which promote magnesium excretion by the kidneys, thus inhibiting tubular reabsorption of the mineral. Since magnesium is essential in some bodily functions like nerve regulation, bone building, etc, its deficiency will lead to severe side-effects.Moreover, entering too much sugar in your organism affects chromium absorption by excreting the essential mineral. This mineral is extremely important since it promotes blood glucose control, macronutrient metabolism and insulin binding. Chromium deficiency leads to high blood sugar levels and poor glucose tolerance.When it comes to calcium, It is vital for electrolyte balance, skeletal health and blood clotting, so excessive sugar intake can negatively affect vitamin D which can cause a ripple effect to the body’s calcium absorption. Calcium deficiency also leads to numerous adverse effects.Sweet killer: The nasty effects of high sugar intake on the bodyNowadays, people are more and more aware of the side-effects of excessive consumption of sugar. For instance, too much sugar can lead to suppressed immune function as well as to trigger hyperactivity in children. Moreover, it can lead to advanced aging, increased blood acidity and kidney damage.Besides the abovementioned, excessive consumption of sugar can also cause candida, asthma, digestive disorders, tooth decay, arthritis, depression, free radical formation, eczema, atherosclerosis, brittle tendons, etc. However, the most hazardous effects are increased liver and kidney sizes.RELATED POSTS  Let’s block ads!

Sponsored Linksby Susan Patterson; The Alternative Daily The lemon was first created as a cross between a lime and a citron, and all three grow on evergreen shrubs. The Arabs introduced this small citrus fruit to the Europeans, who then brought them to Spain in the 11th century.Along with other fruits and vegetables, Christopher Columbus brought lemons with him on his second voyage to the New World in 1493, and they have been growing in Florida since the 16th century.
Besides large amounts of vitamin C, lemons also contain riboflavin, thiamin, iron, magnesium, pantothenic acid, fiber, vitamin B6, potassium, copper, calcium and folate.Here’s an interesting fact: lemons protected miners against scurvy during the California Gold Rush, and cost as much as one dollar each in 1849.
Although we may not be overly concerned about scurvy in America today, here are 27 extraordinary ways to put lemons to work in your life:1. Lemons fight free radicalsVitamin C is the most important antioxidant. This vitamin neutralizes free radicals both inside and outside of cells. Free radicals are responsible for damaging cells and cellular membranes, which lead to inflammation, chronic diseases and accelerated aging.Free radicals can also damage blood vessels and alter cholesterol so that it builds up on artery walls. Vitamin C helps prevent this buildup, and consequently helps to stop the progression of atherosclerosis and heart disease in diabetics.2. Boost immune systemWhen cold and flu season arrives, it is always a good idea to keep a bag of fresh lemons handy. The citric acid, bioflavonoids, vitamin C, calcium, pectin and limonene do a great job of boosting your immune system and keeping infections at bay.3. Protect against cancerLemons contain 22 anti-cancer compounds including limonene, an oil that has been shown to halt the growth of cancer tumors in animals. In addition, they also contain flavonol glycosides, which stop the division of cancer cells.A 2005 study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that limonoids in citrus fruits protect cells from damage that can lead to cancer. Another study published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry stated that limonoids can inhibit tumors in the mouth and stop the growth of cancer cells once a tumor has formed.4. Balance pHLemons are considered one of the most alkalizing foods you can eat. This may seem counterintuitive, as they are acidic on their own. However, in the body, lemons are alkaline; the citric acid does not create acidity once it has been metabolized.The minerals in lemons actually help to alkalize the blood. Most people are too acidic, and lemons reduce overall acidity, drawing uric acid from the joints. This reduces the pain and inflammation which many people feel.5. Aid oxygen uptakeLemons have a purer concentration of negatively charged ions than any other fruit. Dr. Pierce J. Howard, author of “The Owners Manual for the Brain: Everyday Applications from Mind Brain Research,” says, “Negative ions increase the flow of oxygen to the brain, resulting in higher alertness, decreased drowsiness and more mental energy. They also may protect against germs in the air.” The first man to reach the top of Mount Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary, said that he attributed much of his success to lemons!Fact: One lemon tree can produce up to 600 pounds of lemons in a year. If you live in an area where you can grow a tree, you should plant one or two!6. Add fiberMost people fall far short of the 20 to 38 grams of fiber recommended daily. Without proper fiber, however, you can easily become constipated or develop hemorrhoids. Consuming adequate fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of developing health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and diverticulitis.In fact, the American Diabetes Association includes lemons on their list of superfoods because of their high fiber content. In addition, the pectin fiber in lemons can help keep you from getting hungry and overeating.7. Boost mood and energyHave you ever gotten up on the “wrong side of the bed?” If you are often lethargic and cranky in the morning, or any time of the day, for that matter, you may want to consider munching on a lemon.Our energy comes from atoms and molecules in our food. When positively charged atoms flood the digestive tract and mingle with those that are negatively charged, a positive reaction occurs.Lemons contain more negatively charged ions than positive ions, which gives you a boost as the lemon enters your digestive tract. Just the scent alone of lemons can improve your mood and elevate your energy levels. Lemons also promote clear thinking and help reduce anxiety and depression.8. Improve digestive healthYour body works hard to digest all that you give it. Lemon juice helps flush away unwanted materials and toxins left from the digestive process. Because lemon juice is similar in atomic composition to digestive juices and saliva, it does a great job breaking down material and encouraging the liver to produce bile.9. Clear skinSometimes we forget that the key to clear and beautiful skin starts with great nutrition. Thanks to the vitamin C in lemons, these little citrus fruits can help decrease wrinkles and blemishes. Lemons help to push toxins from the body and support healthy liver function, which also keeps skin clear and supple.10. Protect against kidney stonesWhen you don’t have enough citrate in your urine, you are at an increased risk of developing kidney stones. Eating lemons on a regular basis can help raise the citrate levels in your urine. They may prevent stones from forming by coating very small stones and keeping other material from attaching to the small stones and enlarging them.11. Reduce blood pressureLemons are high in potassium, which is an important mineral that helps to keep blood vessels soft and flexible. This, in turn, helps to reduce high blood pressure. The vitamin B in lemons is also beneficial to heart health.12. Refresh cutting boardNo matter how clean you try to keep your cutting boards, it is inevitable that they will capture the odors of the foods that you cut on them. After each use, cut a lemon in half and rub the cutting board down. You can also pour some lemon juice in a small spray bottle and spritz the board after each use. Rinse well and allow the board to air dry.13. Repel insectsIf you have small children or pets you may be leery of using a chemical treatment for insects that decide to take up residence in your home. To keep ants and other insects out spray a little juice on door thresholds and windowsills.If you can see where the ants or other unwanted guests are coming from, squeeze a little juice into holes or cracks. You can also cut up small pieces of lemons outside of doors as well. To deter roaches and fleas, mix the juice of four lemons, with rinds left on, with 1/2 gallon of water and wash your floors.14. Lighten age spotsAge spots, also known as liver spots, are spots that generally appear in people over 50. They can sometimes be the result of sun exposure and are completely harmless, although some people don’t like the way they look.If you are one of those people, you can lighten these spots naturally with lemon. Simply apply some real lemon juice to the dark area (a spray bottle works well), and let it sit on the spot for about 15 minutes before rinsing off. Keep this up daily and you will see a lightening effect in no time.15. Highlight hair naturallyDo you dream of beautiful hair highlights but dread using heavy chemicals? Using lemons for lightening your hair is a wonderful way to get lovely highlights without exposing yourself to toxins. Mix 1/4 cup of lemon juice with 3/4 cup water and use this mixture to rinse your hair. After you rinse, sit in the sun until your hair dries. Repeat this once daily for up to a week until you see the desired results.16. Fight dandruffMany people are plagued with dandruff and tirelessly seek relief. Thankfully, there is a very easy way to ease dandruff using lemon juice. Massage two tablespoons of lemon juice into your scalp and rinse with water. Next, stir one teaspoon of lemon juice into a cup of water and rinse your hair with it. Repeat this until you see an improvement in your dandruff.
17. Freshen breathFor long lasting fresh breath, rinse with straight lemon juice. Rather than spitting the juice out, swallow it. Citric acid, found in lemon juice will alter the pH level in your mouth, killing the bacteria that cause breath odor. Rinse your mouth and teeth well, as long-term exposure to the acid can damage tooth enamel.18. Remove berry stainsBerries are a delicious and nutritious treat and so much fun to go pick yourself. If you find that your fingers become stained from the berries (and they will if you pick enough), you will also find that regular soap and water will not come close to removing the stains.However, pour some undiluted lemon juice on your hands, wait a few minutes, and wash with warm and soapy water. Repeat until your hands are stain-free; it shouldn’t take more than a couple of washes.19. Clean brass and chromeDoes your brass or chrome need a pick-me-up? If so, let lemons do the work for you. You can easily make a paste with lemon juice and baking soda. Just mix enough of each to make the consistency of toothpaste. Apply the mixture to your brass or chrome and let it sit for about five minutes. Wash it off with warm water, then dry and polish with a clean cloth. You can also clean your kitchen sink with this mixture. The bonus is that it smells amazingly fresh. It will work to remove mineral deposits as well.20. Clean and whiten nailsWhether you dig in the dirt a lot, have yellow stains from nail polish, or just have dull and listless nails, lemon juice is just what you need for your nail revival. Lemons contain natural bleaching power that can restore your nails to a vivid white. Fill a bowl halfway with fresh lemon juice.Place your nails in the juice for about fifteen minutes. Use a soft brush or even a toothbrush to gently scrub the yellow from your nails. Rinse your hands with lukewarm water and apply a thin coat of coconut oil. Do this daily until your nail color has been restored.21. Firm up soggy lettuceDo you hate soggy lettuce and often find yourself throwing it out? Before you do, try this: add the juice of half a lemon to a bowl of cold water and place the soggy lettuce in this bowl in the fridge for an hour. You will be amazed at what happens to your limp lettuce. Just take the leaves out of the lemon juice mixture and dry off before using in your salad.22. Aid in proper food and water absorptionA daily glass of lemon water with Himalayan salt may provide a better overall mineral balance, which promotes proper food and water absorption in your body. This allows essential nutrients to get where they need to be.23. Get rid of allergiesIt has been suggested that the combination of lemon and salt, specifically mixed into warm water, acts as a natural antihistamine for allergies. It may be the perfect alternative to those pink pills that leave you feeling drowsy.24. Exfoliate lipsIf you are suffering from dry lips, apply a bit of raw lemon juice to your lips before bedtime. In the morning you will find your lips noticeably softer. Repeat this process for several weeks to promote hydration and remove dead skin cells.25. Boost libidoThe vitamin C content and hormone-balancing properties of lemon water can help lift your mood. This might be all it takes to boost your libido, without the need for that little blue pill.26. Get rid of blackheadsLemons have both antibacterial and astringent properties that help promote the elimination of waste and excess oil on the skin. To help reduce blackheads, rub some lemon on your skin and let it set for ten minutes. Splash your face with cold water. Repeat as necessary. Do not use this treatment before spending time in the sun.27. Fight stinky armpitsLemons have properties that help them act like a natural deodorant. The citric acid kills bacteria that causes bad odors. Simply rub the juice of a fresh lemon under your arm for a practical and effective emergency deodorant. What is the difference between real lemons and bottled lemon juice?Real lemons contain about 139 percent vitamin C, while bottled juice contains 100 percent of the daily value. The calcium content in real lemons is seven percent, while in bottled juice it is three percent. In addition, some bottled lemon juice may also contain fructose and other dangerous additives. Make sure you are using the real thing — it will make a difference.RELATED POSTS  Let’s block ads! (Why?)Every Day is Earth Day








Natural Blaze.comRichard Taylor, University of OregonHumans are visual creatures. Objects we call “beautiful” or “aesthetic” are a crucial part of our humanity. Even the oldest known examples of rock and cave art served aesthetic rather than utilitarian roles. Although aesthetics is often regarded as an ill-defined vague quality, research groups like mine are using sophisticated techniques to quantify it – and its impact on the observer. We’re finding that aesthetic images can induce staggering changes to the body, including radical reductions in the observer’s stress levels. Job stress alone is estimated to cost American businesses many billions of dollars annually, so studying aesthetics holds a huge potential benefit to society.Researchers are untangling just what makes particular works of art or natural scenes visually appealing and stress-relieving – and one crucial factor is the presence of the repetitive patterns called fractals.Are fractals the key to why Pollock’s work captivates? - AP Photo/LM OteroWhen it comes to aesthetics, who better to study than famous artists? They are, after all, the visual experts. My research group took this approach with Jackson Pollock, who rose to the peak of modern art in the late 1940s by pouring paint directly from a can onto horizontal canvases laid across his studio floor. Although battles raged among Pollock scholars regarding the meaning of his splattered patterns, many agreed they had an organic, natural feel to them.My scientific curiosity was stirred when I learned that many of nature’s objects are fractal, featuring patterns that repeat at increasingly fine magnifications. For example, think of a tree. First you see the big branches growing out of the trunk. Then you see smaller versions growing out of each big branch. As you keep zooming in, finer and finer branches appear, all the way down to the smallest twigs. Other examples of nature’s fractals include clouds, rivers, coastlines and mountains.In 1999, my group used computer pattern analysis techniques to show that Pollock’s paintings are as fractal as patterns found in natural scenery. Since then, more than 10 different groups have performed various forms of fractal analysis on his paintings. Pollock’s ability to express nature’s fractal aesthetics helps explain the enduring popularity of his work.The impact of nature’s aesthetics is surprisingly powerful. In the 1980s, architects found that patients recovered more quickly from surgery when given hospital rooms with windows looking out on nature. Other studies since then have demonstrated that just looking at pictures of natural scenes can change the way a person’s autonomic nervous system responds to stress.Are fractals the secret to some soothing natural scenes?
Ronan, CC BY-NC-NDFor me, this raises the same question I’d asked of Pollock: Are fractals responsible? Collaborating with psychologists and neuroscientists, we measured people’s responses to fractals found in nature (using photos of natural scenes), art (Pollock’s paintings) and mathematics (computer generated images) and discovered a universal effect we labeled “fractal fluency.”Through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. We found that this adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way our eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. This fluency puts us in a comfort zone and so we enjoy looking at fractals. Crucially, we used EEG to record the brain’s electrical activity and skin conductance techniques to show that this aesthetic experience is accompanied by stress reduction of 60 percent – a surprisingly large effect for a nonmedicinal treatment. This physiological change even accelerates post-surgical recovery rates.It’s therefore not surprising to learn that, as visual experts, artists have been embedding fractal patterns in their works through the centuries and across many cultures. Fractals can be found, for example, in Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan works. My favorite examples of fractal art from more recent times include da Vinci’s Turbulence (1500), Hokusai’s Great Wave (1830), M.C. Escher’s Circle Series (1950s) and, of course, Pollock’s poured paintings.Although prevalent in art, the fractal repetition of patterns represents an artistic challenge. For instance, many people have attempted to fake Pollock’s fractals and failed. Indeed, our fractal analysis has helped identify fake Pollocks in high-profile cases. Recent studies by others show that fractal analysis can help distinguish real from fake Pollocks with a 93 percent success rate.How artists create their fractals fuels the nature-versus-nurture debate in art: To what extent is aesthetics determined by automatic unconscious mechanisms inherent in the artist’s biology, as opposed to their intellectual and cultural concerns? In Pollock’s case, his fractal aesthetics resulted from an intriguing mixture of both. His fractal patterns originated from his body motions (specifically an automatic process related to balance known to be fractal). But he spent 10 years consciously refining his pouring technique to increase the visual complexity of these fractal patterns.The Rorschach inkblot test relies on what you read in to the image.
Hermann RorschachPollock’s motivation for continually increasing the complexity of his fractal patterns became apparent recently when I studied the fractal properties of Rorschach inkblots. These abstract blots are famous because people see imaginary forms (figures and animals) in them. I explained this process in terms of the fractal fluency effect, which enhances people’s pattern recognition processes. The low complexity fractal inkblots made this process trigger-happy, fooling observers into seeing images that aren’t there.Pollock disliked the idea that viewers of his paintings were distracted by such imaginary figures, which he called “extra cargo.” He intuitively increased the complexity of his works to prevent this phenomenon.Pollock’s abstract expressionist colleague, Willem De Kooning, also painted fractals. When he was diagnosed with dementia, some art scholars called for his retirement amid concerns that that it would reduce the nurture component of his work. Yet, although they predicted a deterioration in his paintings, his later works conveyed a peacefulness missing from his earlier pieces. Recently, the fractal complexity of his paintings was shown to drop steadily as he slipped into dementia. The study focused on seven artists with different neurological conditions and highlighted the potential of using art works as a new tool for studying these diseases. To me, the most inspiring message is that, when fighting these diseases, artists can still create beautiful artworks.READ MORE“Blazing a path to natural health and wellness.

Natural Blaze.comWritten by Cassius M.At 10 months of age, Kalel Santiago of Puerto Rico was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called neuroblastoma. He endured chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and surgery for two years—and survived. Then he was diagnosed with something permanent: severe autism that disabled him from speaking.“While he was in the hospital, we noticed he didn’t speak at all and had some behavior that wasn’t right, like hand flapping, and walking on his toes,” his father Abiel Gomez Santiago told Yahoo News. “But we waited until he was 3 and cancer-free to look at his behavior.”According to Yahoo, “He and his wife Gladys — also parents to two older boys, now 18 and 20 — did a cram course in educating themselves on autism. They tried various schools and therapies and eventually found impressive success with a unique surf-therapy school near their home.”Eventually, the Santiago family stumbled upon a treatment of real potency and potential: CBD oil.Through a fundraising program, they were able to receive a tiny bottle of the oil. Kalel was given oral doses twice a day.Within just two days, he was finally able to speak. “He surprised us in school by saying the vowels, A-E-I-O-U. It was the first time ever,” Abiel said. “You can’t imagine the emotion we had, hearing Kalel’s voice for the first time. It was amazing. The teacher recorded him and sent it to my wife and me and we said well, the only different thing we have been doing is using the CBD.”Soon after, he began using consonants, too, speaking like his parents never thought possible. “He said, ‘amo mi mama,’ ‘I love my mom,’” Abiel says. “I don’t know how to thank [the CBD oil makers].”Natural Blaze.com clarification: The CBD oil that the Santiago family used came from hemp oil which is legal in all states. The brand they used was Hemp Health Inc.READ MORE“Blazing a path to natural health and wellness. Get natural health news, remedies and tips at naturalblaze.com”








The anomalies of the halo model of dark matter have begun to accumulate rapidly. The problems of the halo model are discussed in detail in the blog “Dark matter crisis” of Prof. Pavel Kroupa and Marcel S. Pawlowski (see this). MOND is the most well-known competitor of the halo model for dark matter but has its own problems. TGD is less known alternative for the halo model. In the following brief comments about Zwicky paradox (see this) implying that neither cold nor warm dark matter particles in the usual sense (different from that in TGD based model) can play a significant role in cosmology.The standard/concordance model of dark matter relies on two hypothesis formulated originally by Zwicky assuming that a) GRT is correct in all scales and b) all matter is created during Big Bang. Zwicky formulated two hypothesis (for references see the article) leading to the halo model of dark matter and also to Zwicky paradox.From these observations one ends up with a computer model allowing to simulate the formation of galaxies (for a detailed discussion see this). The basic elements of the model are collisions of galaxies possibly leading to a fusion and formation of tidal galaxies. The model assumes a statistical distribution of dark matter lumps defining the halos of the dwarf galaxies formed in the process.The model predicts a lot of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies formed around the dark matter lumps: velocity spectrum should approach constant. There are also tidal dwarf galaxies formed from collision debris of other galaxies. Unless also now condensation around a dark matter lump is involved, these should not contain dark matter and velocity spectrum for tidal dwarfs should be declining. It turns out that tidal dwarfs alone are able to explain the observed dwarf galaxies, which are typically elliptic. Furthermore, there is no empirical manner to distinguish between tidal dwarfs and other dwarfs.Do the elliptic galaxies contain dark matter? What does one know about the rotation curves of elliptic galaxies? There is an article “The rotation curves of elliptic galaxies” of J. Binney published around 1979 about the determination of the rotation curves of elliptic galaxies giving also some applications (see this). The velocity curves are declining as if no dark matter were present. Therefore dark matter would not be present in dwarf galaxies so that the prediction of the halo model would be wrong.Could this finding be also a problem for MOND? Assuming that the laws governing gravitation are modified for small accelerations, shouldn’t elliptic and spiral galaxies have similar velocity curves?What about TGD?For a summary of earlier postings see Latest progress in TGD.Articles and other material related to TGD.








From a Japanese Atlantis to a giant cannibal shark, this video takes a look at the top 5 unesolved ocean mysteries. Due to the fact that the oceans on this planet are some of the most unexplored places on Earth, they are shrouded in mystery. We know more about the surface of the moon than the bottom of the ocean.More at - http://www.paranormalelite.com/2017/04/top-5-ocean-mysteries.html








It has been an exciting time for exoplanet research of late! Back in February, the world was astounded when astronomers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) announced the  discovery of seven planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, all of which were comparable in size to Earth, and three of which were found to orbit within the star’s habitable zone.And now, a team of international astronomers has announced the discovery of an extra-solar body that is similar to another terrestrial planet in our own Solar System. It’s known as Kepler-1649b, a planet that appears to be similar in size and density to Earth and is located in a star system just 219 light-years away. But in terms of its atmosphere, this planet appears to be decidedly more “Venus-like” (i.e. insanely hot!)The team’s study, titled “Kepler-1649b: An Exo-Venus in the Solar Neighborhood“, was recently published in The Astronomical Journal. Led by Isabel Angelo – of the SETI Institute, NASA Ames Research Center, and UC Berkley – the team included researchers also from SETI and Ames, as well as the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScl), the Exoplanet Research Institute (iREx), the Center for Astrophysics Research, and other research institutions.Diagram comparing the Solar System to Kepler 69 and its system of exoplanets. Credit: NASA Ames/JPL-CaltechNeedless to say, this discovery is a significant one, and the implications of it go beyond exoplanet research. For some time, astronomers have wondered how – given their similar sizes, densities, and the fact that they both orbit within the Sun’s habitable zone – that Earth could develop conditions favorable to life while Venus would become so hostile. As such, having a “Venus-like” planet that is close enough to study presents some exciting opportunities.In the past, the Kepler mission has located several extra-solar planets that were similar in some ways to Venus. For instance, a few years ago, astronomers detected a Super-Earth – Kepler-69b, which appeared to measure 2.24 times the diameter of Earth – that was in a Venus-like orbit around its host the star. And then there was GJ 1132b, a Venus-like exoplanet candidate that is about 1.5 times the mass of Earth, and located just 39 light-years away.In addition, dozens of smaller planet candidates have been discovered that astronomers think could have atmospheres similar to that of Venus. But in the case of Kepler-1649b, the team behind the discovery were able to determine that the planet had a sub-Earth radius (similar in size to Venus) and receives a similar amount of light (aka. incident flux) from its star as Venus does from Earth.However, they also noted that the planet also differs from Venus in a few key ways – not the least of which are its orbital period and the type of star it orbits. As Dr. Angelo told Universe Today via email:“The planet is similar to Venus in terms of it’s size and the amount of light it receives from it’s host star. This means it could potentially have surface temperatures similar to Venus as well. It differs from Venus because it orbits a star that is much smaller, cooler, and redder than our sun. It completes its orbit in just 9 days, which places it close to its host star and subjects it to potential factors that Venus does not experience, including exposure to magnetic radiation and tidal locking. Also, since it orbits a cooler star, it receives more lower-energy radiation from its host star than Earth receives from the Sun.”Artist’s impression of Venus’ atmosphere. For decades, astronomers have sought to determine what evolutionary factors led to Venus becoming such a hostile world. Credit and ©: ESA/J. WhatmoreIn other words, while the planet appears to receive a comparable amount of light/heat from its host star, it is also subject to far more low-energy radiation. And as a potentially tidally-locked planet, the surface’s exposure to this radiation would be entirely disproportionate. And last, its proximity to its star means it would be subject to greater tidal forces than Venus – all of which has drastic implications for the planet’s geological activity and seasonal variations.Despite these differences, Kepler-1649b remains the most Venus-like planet discovered to date. Looking to the future, it is hoped that next-generations instruments – like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the James Webb Telescope and the Gaia spacecraft – will allow for more detailed studies. From these, astronomers hope to more accurately determine the size and distance of the planet, as well as the temperature of its host star.This information will, in turn, help us learn a great deal more about what goes into making a planet “habitable”. As Angelo explained:“Understanding how hotter planets develop thick, Venus-like atmospheres that make then inhabitable will be important in constraining our definition of a ‘habitable zone’. This may become possible in the future when we develop instruments sensitive enough to determine chemical compositions of planet atmospheres (around cool stars) using a method called ‘transit spectroscopy’, which looks at the light from the host star that has passed through the planet’s atmosphere during transit.”The development of such instruments will be especially useful given joust how many exoplanets are being detected around neighboring red dwarf stars. Given that they account for roughly 85% of stars in the Milky Way, knowing whether or not they can have habitable planets will certainly be of interest!Further Reading: The Astronomical JournalThe post Venus 2.0 Discovered In Our Own Back Yard appeared first on Universe Today.








“It’s a kinder, gentler Neptune,” says Gemini astronomer Meg Schwamb in describing a new result that leaves little doubt about how Neptune gently swept a class of planetoid pairs into the outer Solar System.The study focused on a type of loosely bound pairs of planetoids in the outer reaches of our Solar System that scientists say were likely shepherded by Neptune’s gravitational nudges into their current orbits in the distant Kuiper Belt. The paper is published in the April 4th issue of the journal Nature Astronomy(subscription required).The research team, led by Wes Fraser of Queen’s University in Belfast, UK, used data collected from the Gemini North Frederick C. Gillett Telescope and Canada-France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) both on Maunakea in Hawai‘i. The team measured the colors of peculiar new Cold Classical Kuiper Belt Object (CCKBO) pairs as part of the Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS).The objects are among a category of bodies known as “blue binaries” which are oddball pairs in the Kuiper Belt because they don’t share the very red color that distinguishes most of the other CCKBO’s surfaces. The Kuiper Belt is a huge swarm of icy small planetoids well beyond the orbit of Neptune, and left-over from the formation of our Solar System.Artist’s conception of a loosely tethered binary planetoid pair like those studied by Fraser et al. in this work which led to the conclusion that Neptune’s shepherding of them to the Kuiper Belt as gradual and gentle in nature. Credit: Gemini Observatoryy/AURA, artwork by Joy Pollard.“The red CCKBOs are thought to have formed at the location in the outer Solar System where they currently reside. The blue binaries, on the other hand, are interlopers from closer in hiding out in the Kuiper belt today,” says Schwamb, who is also a coauthor on the study.Fraser and his team compared the observed properties of the blue binaries to models of Neptune’s migration. Fraser found that although these blue binaries have such a tenuous gravitational embrace, these pairs can survive Neptune’s smoothly pushing them over a distance of at least four AU (four times the distance between the Earth and Sun) as the giant planet migrated outward. “The blue binaries are fossils from the long gone planetary disk that our planets formed from. These objects give us a unique new window into the history of the our Solar System,” Schwamb adds.The Gemini North telescope (foreground, right) with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in background (left). Image obtained during observations for Col-OSSOS and both telescopes are pointing at the same target.Chris Davis, Program Officer at the U.S. National Science Foundation, one of the five partner organizations which support Gemini operations, notes that “This is another great example of the successful use of one of Gemini’s many versatile observing modes. The observatory’s Large and Long Program has allowed the team to find and study these enigmatic objects in amongst a sea of millions of other Kuiper Belt Objects.”The Gemini/CFHT observations help address ongoing questions and debates among scientists about Neptune’s migration from its primordial formation orbital location to its current locale. The team found and characterized the peculiar blue binary objects thanks to CFHT MEGACAM data and confirmed by follow-up observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) which was part of an ongoing Large and Long Program at Gemini to study the outer reaches of our Solar System.The observations required significant coordination between Gemini and CFHT. “Like synchronized swimming, Gemini North and the Canada-France-Hawaii telescopes aligned their movements to observe the Col-OSSOS Kuiper Belt objects at nearly the same time,” said Schwamb. “This choreographed ballet on Maunakea allowed us to measure the light from the same side of the Kuiper Belt object, removing one of the main challenges in studying Solar System bodies that rotate.”“Facilitating the simultaneous observations with the Col-OSSOS team and Gemini Observatory was challenging, but paved the way for a greater understanding of the origins of these blue binaries,” said Todd Burdullis, Queued Service Operations Specialist at CFHT who helped to coordinate the observations. “In tandem, the two facilities observed all the colors of the outer solar system for the Col-OSSOS team.”Contacts and sources:

My Kindle Voyage arrived on a day when Houston had 4 tornadoes touchdown. Unlike the Dallas area, this is not common occurrence here. Tons of rain, wind, and, of course, a power outage that lasted from before noon Wednesday to the wee hours of Thursday morning. As my daughter says, “Good times.”
I picked it up from the package locker and forgot about it since I left home early Thursday morning. Finally home again, I plugged it in and charged it.
My Thoughts
I'm so used to the Kindle 3G keyboard that I've had since early 2010, that it took a while to get used to it. With my old Kindle, I could open the Kindle Store at any time, anywhere, and download books.
With the Voyage, since I opted for the WiFi version only, I have to remember to have books downloaded to the device before I leave home. (I try to avoid pubic WiFi since there are so many ways hackers can mess up your devices. Don't know if they can infect a Kindle–probably not at this point–but I try to practice safe WiFi and just avoid the public ones.)

The reading screen on the Voyage is almost the same size as my old Kindle. What's missing is the keyboard and the slightly larger frame surrounding the screen. Personally, I like the larger frame because I can easily hold the older Kindles.
With the Voyage, you have about a half inch spaced around the screen with which to hold it. That actually ends up making my hand tired because I used to read in bed and just prop the Kindle on a pillow so I didn't have to hold it.
Also with the older Kindle your library was displayed and all your books were in it either listed individually or in Collections you set up. If you deleted a book from your device, you could just go to Archived Items and quickly download it again.
With Voyage, everything is in the Cloud. If you suddenly want to check something in another book or just switch books, you have to take time to download the new one from the Cloud. How fast it downloads depends on the WiFi speed. 
Another thing about the Voyage is that the display is “busy.” I actually just like a list of my books. I don't want to see covers of other books that they're pushing. Again, I wasn't thinking. I believe I ended up with the Voyage with special offers so be careful what you order. I also don't like being prompted continuously to post a review, go to Goodreads, tell my friends about, Like it on FB, etc. I do all that anyway, but I don't want the Kindle proclaiming it at every opportunity. You can turn most of that off in Settings but not all of it. I just find it intrusive and annoying.
 The battery life is supposedly much longer than on the Kindle, but the caveat is that you must turn the WiFi off or the battery drains as fast as any device connected to WiFi. I finally remembered to put it in Airplane Mode.
Oh, and I decided to get the Voyage because it has PagePress, buttons to navigate through the book. I read fast and get tired of swiping. Plus, I hate touchscreens. I think I'm just not touchscreen coordinated. I didn't realize that everything else about the Voyage is accessed via touchscreen. I guess I thought there would be a navigation button to scroll up and down lists of books. There isn't so beware of possibly buying something you didn't intend if your finger strays.
In Summation: Pros
1. Smaller so will fit easily into all purses, maybe the back pocket of jeans, etc.2. Built-in light.3. Longer battery charge if you turn the WiFi off.4. PagePress buttons to navigate through a book. 
I wish I could think of some other pros toward this purchase, but at this time, I simply can't. 
In Summation: Cons
1. Harder to hold without getting your fingers on the screen.2. Display is busy with too many things on the screen.3. No navigation button for selecting books. Touchscreen only for all other functions. 4. Intrusive announcements and exhortations from Amazon.5. Must remember to download when you have secure WiFi.6. Much more expensive. 
Takeaway Truth
I guess the bottom line is I wish I'd bought a Kindle Paperwhite with 3G which has the built in light. I think I would have liked it better and could have saved myself a lot of money.

Sponsored Linksby stewart; stewartbitkoff.com Circumstances have overtaken man. His old languages are not sufficient to describe what is happening, and what is about to happen. To think in terms of a millennium or such tame concepts as ‘the eleventh hour’ is ridiculous. Better that he should realize that he is in an era which might be more accurately described as the ‘eighth day of the week.” Idries ShahFor the spiritual traveler, we are living in a complex and unique age; one of tremendous upheaval and great opportunity to solve problems. Turn on the television set and listen to the reports coming in from all across the world: religious wars, effects of global warming, famine, new strains of disease, drug wars, over weight children, advances in technology and people beginning to work together to solve problems of housing, job loss, and keeping their family together. This combination of factors has been called the ‘eighth day of the week’ and the beginning of a new era; clearly, until many of these problems are resolved, if that is possible, the amount of unsettledness, fear, anxiety and personal worry for many will continue to grow. 
For increasing numbers of people, the personal balancing factor to this stress and chaos, is spiritual development. It must be added to the mix and used with our other capacities to find solutions. Higher knowledge will not replace common sense, experience, hard work, or economic imperative. That is not its function. It is an added capacity which integrates and works alongside others.The present discussion will examine some basic thoughts about being spiritual; and how spiritual capacity can help the traveler deal with this period of chaos and change.What Does It Mean To Be Spiritual?What does the term spiritual mean? Spiritual is not an easy word to define, because there is an experiential aspect to it, with many levels and dimensions. Sort of like love, which is a sublime experience and occurs in many forms; poets and song writers proclaim its virtues and sorrows, yet, no matter how fine the words, they are only an approximation.Typical definitions include phrases such as: spiritual means of the spirit. This type of definition: defines itself using the same word, yet, surprisingly is reasonably accurate. Spiritual does mean of the spirit.For the spiritual traveler, the soul is comprised of a spiritual energy fabric; this spiritual energy fabric is the source of life and powers our body, 5 senses, emotions and consciousness. To the soul, there is a higher and lower aspect which corresponds to different parts of our functioning (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual); to further complicate, in some discussions soul/spirit are used interchangeably.Characteristics of a Spiritual PersonAnother way to help define spiritual is to examine personality traits of spiritual people. These characteristics help us get a better understanding of what it means to be spiritual in daily life, however, there are problems here as well; while these traits are accurate, also, they can be said to exist in non-spiritual people:While the spiritual traveler acknowledges problems in definition and realizes they are seeking an illusive essence, there is another part of the consciousness that offers: ‘do not worry- you will know it, when you find it.’ Like love- spiritual defines itself and by adding this capacity to your life, you life will be fuller, more complete and you will be better able to face life’s ups and downs.Routine Change or the End?Through increased information that is available via television and the internet, the average person viewing the unrest in our world cannot help but wonder: what is going on? Conversely, scientists and philosophers tell us, chaos and order are simply opposite ends of a continuum. Both are natural to life and necessary to the physical order. And so the spiritual traveler wonders: is this era simply a routine period of unrest- soon to be followed by a period of relative calm?Consider the following themes and ideas, and how each contributes to our fear and growing anxiety level. Each of which can be found either in your religious/spiritual belief system or on your local television programs, nightly and weekly.Understanding Emotion: Love and FearBy nature, we are emotional and our reactions to life, through multiple feelings contribute to a richer, full experience. When something happens in daily life that is painful we all have a reaction to it. We are multi-level beings and our emotions bring us both great joy and sadness. That is the way we are hardwired and for good health, must honor our feelings.One model, suggests that all emotions arise from the 2 basic feelings of love and fear. According to Frank Sant’Agata, all emotions can be traced back to these primary feelings.“Love and fear are the only emotions we as human entities are able to express. All the others are just sub-categorical emotions. For example, on love’s side there is joy, peacefulness, happiness, forgiveness, and a host of others. On the other hand, fear reflects: hate, depression, guilt, inadequacy, discontentment, prejudice, anger, attack, and so on.Love and fear can not coexist. Where one is, the other can’t be also. The one will leave immediately, should the other enter its presence. If you find yourself in a situation where you are experiencing great joy, and are suddenly overtaken by fear, the joy is gone! But it works the other way too: If you are terrorized, frightened, or otherwise threatened in any way, all you need to do is turn to the love within and the fears disappears.”Next time you are watching TV Talk Shows and the Host is trying to convince you of something, evaluate their presentation using the following criteria: is this a manipulation of the fear and reward stick. Do as I say- good things will happen; if not, bad things will happen. Most often, the media, politicians, some forms of religion, and corporations continually use this manipulation. Unless you see the manipulation- it is very difficult to understand and disarm, particularly, when you are up against a formidable societal power structure.From a spiritual standpoint, we want to become masters of our emotions, so we can temporarily get beyond them. When we are emotionally charged, most often, the quiet, spiritual part of ourselves will not come forward. It will not operate under these conditions.Daily Practices to Counter FearOK, so now that you have me totally paranoid, and frightened about the end of the world, what am I supposed to do about all of this? Here are a few suggestions, from my personal tool box on life, to help you conquer your fear reaction, and more easily access that quiet part of yourself which is more peaceful and serene.ConclusionsAnd the more we practice controlling our consciousness and awareness, and seeing the fear/reward manipulation about us, the easier it will become to think more tranquil thoughts. Then, one day we will experience what lies beyond emotions; and the higher consciousness will emerge.Often for many events in life, we cannot control harmful outcomes; when something painful or chaotic occurs, we must feel and honor the pain. Yet, experience teaches with a little hard work, we can limit fear and worry about potentials; all of us must learn to separate out what is a possibility, and learn to use the tools in our personal tool box to move past potentials and reach happier, more tranquil states.In 1969, it was during a BBC interview that Mrs. Beryl Worth, when questioned about her positive personal adjustment, to a recent potentially fatal diagnosis of cancer, answered in the following way.‘I think it was St. Ignatius who was sweeping the corridor and his novices came and said to him, ‘If the world, if you knew the world were going to come to an end in 10 minutes, what would you do? And he said, ‘Go on sweeping the corridor.” And that is just what I’m going to do.”In every moment, life is ending and beginning; life is joy and pain, chaos and peace. With every moment, after we have experienced what we need to experience; we must learn and remember to go on doing our work, and ‘continue sweeping the corridor.’ReferencesIdries Shah, Knowing How To Know, The Octagon Press,London, 1998, p. 152.This quote appears online at Frank Sant’Agata, On Love and Fear, http://timelessmiracles.com/LightGuide/love.htm, and accessed3/22/09.Interview with Mrs. Beryl Worth shortly before her death.

We eat a lot of chicken in this house.   We quite like it, and its quite affordable. I really like the dark meat mmost of all, but I tend to cook breasts most of the time because they are healthier.  It can be rather tasteless sometimes and has a tendancy to dry out more than the rest, especially if overcooked.   A good chicken breast, however,  is rather like a canvas waiting to be painted upon . . .  I prefer my chicken breasts with parts of the bone still attached, which helps to keep them moist I think, but the other day I decided I was going to try brining them in a simple salt and water brine, only for a short time . . . just to see if it made a difference and . . . guess what?It worked beautifully . . . these chicken breasts were deliciously moist and tender.  I covered them with a tasty herbed crumb and baked them in a mix of chicken stock and butter until the juices ran clear . . .

Then I turned those pan juices into a delicious gravy which was absolutely wonderful spooned over mounds of mashed potatoes, and of course with that tender flavourful chicken.  It was quite a delicious meal actually.  I will do this again!  It's amazing what a little salt bath can do. Note – You won't need to season your chicken with any salt as it will have absorbed some of the salt from the bath.

When the pot of pasta begins to boil and froth, place a wooden spoon across the top of the kettle to prevent the liquid from boiling over. I do not know why this works (or where I first heard this tip) but it does.It used to be that once the water boiled, I’d have to lift the kettle off the heat until the burner cooled, but the wooden-spoon trick makes it so I can leave the kettle alone, just turning the heat down when the water boils too fast. The water froths around the spoon, but it doesn’t spill over.Anybody else use this trick? Am I batty for thinking it works? Anyone have an explanation?This same time, years previous: the quotidian (4.4.16), red raspberry pie, sun days, working lunches, cup cheese, spinach cheese crepes.

Roger Higgins explains how to make mini greenhouses for sowing seeds.

Roger Higgins explains how to make mini greenhouses for sowing seeds.Meet Roger Higgins from Roger’s Backyard Nursery in Cranesville, Pa.  Every one of those plastic jugs next to Roger contains seeds.  Some are perennial seeds, some might be Dogwood Seeds, maybe some Japanese maple seeds.Some of the jugs are milk jugs, the bigger jugs are kitty litter jugs.  If you look closely Roger has each jug numbered and he has a record in the house of what’s in each jug.  Pretty organized right?Roger Higgins and Duston McGroarty discuss growing seeds in the rain.In our recent trip to Roger’s nursery Duston and I shot several videos that day with Roger.  It was raining and at times pretty much pouring.  Duston was shooting the videos with an I-pad and we didn’t want the device to get soaked so Roger went in and got Duston this cute umbrella.  To protect the device of course!  Roger and I got soaked, I was taking stills with my phone and it got soaked.  But we had a good time as you’ll see in the videos as I post them.And we captured a lot of great information.Roger will tell you that he is a machinist by trade and knew little about growing plants until he found http://www.mikesbackyardnursery.com/.  But I have to tell you, Roger has been an awesome student and he has the coolest backyard nursery ever, and he sells a lot of plants out of his backyard in the rural community of Cranesville, Pa.  And he’s a nice guy!Be sure to watch the video as Roger and I discuss how he grows these seeds and he explains how he makes these little greenhouses out of plastic jugs.  Roger is an innovator and he found a way to improve upon a method that has been around for a long time.In the video you can see how wet we are!Thanks Roger for allowing us to invade your backyard and tell Venice that a little rain won’t hurt her.  She stayed in the house!  However, I’ll bet during plant selling season she gets plenty wet on rainy days while she tends to selling plants when Roger is at work.Great people both of them!  Love having them as Members.For those of you who love to see the donkeys, I’ve created a page just for you, “The Donkey Chronicles”.Questions, comments, mean things to say?  Post them below and I’ll respond.








This article is taken from Five Gallon Ideas, which features over 100 uses for 5 gallon buckets with more being added all the time.We wrote an article back in 2012 with some suggestions for the type of places where you can pick up five gallon buckets for free. The general advice given there still applies, but it’s useful perhaps if we give you a list of stores where people have had success picking up five gallon buckets for free.We definitely recommend getting buckets for free. You’re not just doing yourself a favor, these buckets you get for free would probably end up in a landfill somewhere, where they slowly decay. Nobody wants plastic to get into our environment!To save you some work, we compiled a list of stores that hand out their buckets for free. We also have a list of stores that don’t hand them out. Some stores recycle their buckets, other send them back to the manufacturers, others might have their own reasons.People have had success picking up five gallon buckets for free at the following stores:Some places where people did not have success picking up five gallon buckets are:This list is not complete. Hopefully some of you who managed to get their five gallon buckets for free can share your experiences in the comments below, so that we can add to it.We really recommend trying to get your bucket for free, but if the above stores don’t get you anywhere, you can simply order buckets over at Amazon for a reasonable price too.The post Stores that hand out five gallon buckets for free appeared first on Five Gallon Ideas.For many more ways to use 5 gallon buckets for self sufficiency, visit Five Gallon Ideas.

 What do you think the biggest issues the world faces today are? Most people would say matters of bias and privilege, right? Well what if you could go somewhere where those weren’t problems? The truth is, you can. This utopia has existed for 50 years, even; it’s called Auroville, and is located in Southern India.The brainchild of Mirra Alfansa, Auroville is a universally welcoming place, regardless of nationality, culture, religion, or language. Instead, it celebrates what we all are: Citizens of earth.
Alfansa created a charter by which the city runs, and no nation can claim property of the place. Instead, it belongs to the world. There is no authority, legal or political, nor a person of power, that the inhabitants need to respect. There are no written laws either. Instead, there is only one supreme universal truth by which the city runs; citizens work toward harmony, love, and acceptance, and prioritize education and research. As a result, the functioning of the town is organized in a very modern and environmental friendly way. They have implemented systems of wastewater treatment, as well as systems of ground water depletion. Auroville uses eco-friendly methods for production of organic food, as well as technologically advanced methods for making the poor soil fertile. With the time, the town has become self-sufficient when it comes to food production and drinking water. Starting from the seventies, they have started a process of forestation, and today the city is settled within a belt of forests and fields, making it one of the cleanest places on earth. Even crazier, Aurovillians use no money – they have a whole economy functioning on principles of sharing, giving, and exchanging. There is a distribution center in the city where both citizens and strangers can get a meal, but mainly, people produce what they need and exchange items with neighbors, without any aspirations of earning from the barter economy. As a result of the cosmopolitan spirit embedded in the city, today it is inhabited with representatives from more than 50 nations. It is protected under the authority of UNESCO, which in a way secures its future existence. The town has no restrictions – everyone is welcomes to come and to find his own peace. We just might have to consider moving!

I do get second chances.  From God, from others.  And for that, I am extremely blessed.I’ve learned that…
even when I’ve had pains, I don’t have to be one.I’ve learned that…
people won’t always appreciate, respect, care for or trust me, but that shouldn’t change the way I treat them because if it does, then I’m stooping to their level.I’ve learned that…
the best company I can keep is just me and God.I’ve learned that…
letting go of someone who has constantly manipulated my heart and caused me hurt and grief, is one of the most freeing things I could ever do.I’ve learned that…
every day is an opportunity to give to others what you have received, and to love on them.  A hug, a cup of coffee, a smile, a compliment.  It doesn’t have to be anything extravagant.  After all, it’s the little things in life that matter the most.I’ve learned that…
people will forget what I said and what I did, but they will never forget how I made them feel.I’ve learned that…
sleep really is necessary and if I’m not getting the rest my body needs, my brain will start working in weird ways and stuff will get messy.I’ve learned that…

just because I love someone with everything I have in me doesn’t mean they will return that love.  But this doesn’t mean that I should be afraid of ever loving again.I’ve learned that…
people don’t have control over the way I react or how I allow them to affect me.  If there’s tension or drama, stay clear of it.  If I’m in the middle of it, don’t let it get to me.  Rise above it.  Be mature. Stay calm.I’ve learned that…
regardless of the relationship I have with my parents, I will always miss being away from them and they will always be there for me when I need them.  More importantly too, they will always love me.I’ve learned that…
God and family really are everything.  Other people may come and go but these two are forever, so I need to invest in those relationships because whenever I hit rock bottom, they will be all I have.I’ve learned that…
nothing will ruin my life more than thinking I should have my life together already.I’ve learned that…

by Organic & HealthyWhoa – is that ever a headline! And have we ever got some huge news to share with you!Unfortunately, it’s not what you think. In fact, it has nothing to do with stoners from outer space.Now that you’re here, though, you can help prove some research recently into social media sharing behavior. In particular, there’s a large population of social media users who don’t read the things they share.
This isn’t a new phenomenon.In fact, last year, NPR shared an article titled “Why doesn’t America read anymore?” The April Fools joke, of course, was that there was no article – it was a blank link. That, of course, didn’t stop plenty of people from weighing in with an opinion on an article they hadn’t read.
Yackler did similarly, and we’ve now had a chance here to do the same.Computer scientists at Columbia University and the French National Institute recently looked into this phenomenon. Using a dataset of over 2.8 million online news articles shared via Twitter, they found that up to 59% of the links shared were never clicked by those sharing the article. The results certainly seem to suggest that social media users are far more likely to share something than click it and read it.“People are more willing to share an article than read it,” the study’s co-author Arnaud Legout said in a statement, Washington Post reports. “This is typical of modern information consumption. People form an opinion based on a summary, or a summary of summaries, without making the effort to go deeper.”In the words of one participant from the study: “I try to share only information that will reinforce the image I’d like to present: thoughtful, reasoned, kind, interested and passionate about certain things.”It also raises the question of whether online media is just a massive “echo chamber,” where we all just like pages and viewpoints that reinforce our own beliefs and are not interested in information for the sake of information.Even the algorithms of social media sites mean that individuals or pages that you tend to click on, like, or share – which are most often the articles or viewpoints that you agree with – will more frequently turn up on your News Feed. Cognitive dissonance frequently results, as we’re less exposed to viewpoints other than our own.As a user of online media, you’re probably quite aware of this.Take a look at any comment on social media pages, including those, of course, on our Facebook page. It’s particularly noticeable on the more “emotive” and controversial of subjects; think climate change, GMOs, vaccinations, aliens, and a lot of our articles on marijuana, where the top comments often repeat or question something that is fairly explicitly in the article, but not the headline.So, if you are one of the lucky few who managed to click and read this article, we congratulate you! Although we do apologize for the misleading headline. In the meanwhile, have fun sharing the article and seeing who manages to chair a discussion on marijuana genetics, without ever reading it.Let’s block ads! (Why?)Every Day is Earth Day








“50 Questions That Will Free Your Mind”
by Marc Chernoff

“These questions have no right or wrong answers, because sometimes asking the right questions is the answer.

1. How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you are?2. Which is worse, failing or never trying?
3. If life is so short, why do we do so many things we don’t like and like so many things we don’t do?4. When it’s all said and done, will you have said more than you’ve done?5.

8. If the average human life span was 40 years, how would you live your life differently?9. To what degree have you actually controlled the course your life has taken?
10. Are you more worried about doing things right, or doing the right things?11. You’re having lunch with three people you respect and admire. They all start criticizing a close friend of yours, not knowing she is your friend. The criticism is distasteful and unjustified. What do you do?12. If you could offer a newborn child only one piece of advice, what would it be?13. Would you break the law to save a loved one?14. Have you ever seen insanity where you later saw creativity?15. What’s something you know you do differently than most people?16. How come the things that make you happy don’t make everyone happy?17. What one thing have you not done that you really want to do? What’s holding you back?18. Are you holding onto something you need to let go of?19. If you had to move to a state or country besides the one you currently live in, where would you move and why?20. Do you push the elevator button more than once? Do you really believe it makes the elevator faster?21. Would you rather be a worried genius or a joyful simpleton?22. Why are you, you?23. Have you been the kind of friend you want as a friend?24. Which is worse, when a good friend moves away, or losing touch with a good friend who lives right near you?25. What are you most grateful for?26. Would you rather lose all of your old memories, or never be able to make new ones?27. Is is possible to know the truth without challenging it first?28. Has your greatest fear ever come true?29. Do you remember that time 5 years ago when you were extremely upset? Does it really matter now?
30. What is your happiest childhood memory? What makes it so special?31. At what time in your recent past have you felt most passionate and alive?32. If not now, then when?33. If you haven’t achieved it yet, what do you have to lose?
34. Have you ever been with someone, said nothing, and walked away feeling like you just had the best conversation ever?35. Why do religions that support love cause so many wars?36. Is it possible to know, without a doubt, what is good and what is evil?37. If you just won a million dollars, would you quit your job?38. Would you rather have less work to do, or more work you actually enjoy doing?39. Do you feel like you’ve lived this day a hundred times before?
40. When was the last time you marched into the dark with only the soft glow of an idea you strongly believed in?41. If you knew that everyone you know was going to die tomorrow, who would you visit today?42. Would you be willing to reduce your life expectancy by 10 years to become extremely attractive or famous?43. What is the difference between being alive and truly living?44. When is it time to stop calculating risk and rewards, and just go ahead and do what you know is right?45. If we learn from our mistakes, why are we always so afraid to make a mistake?46. What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you?
47. When was the last time you noticed the sound of your own breathing?48. What do you love? Have any of your recent actions openly expressed this love?49. In 5 years from now, will you remember what you did yesterday? What about the day before that? Or the day before that?50. Decisions are being made right now. The question is: Are you making them for yourself, or are you letting others make them for you?”

Sanders is out to lunch on economics, but we don’t think of him as caniving, which stands in contrast to most of the jackals in the Senate.The Hillary crew resented the old man. They didn’t respect him and they couldn’t believe that he’d dare challenge the annointed one. But he challenged, and in a fair fight he might have won.We haven’t forgotten the 6 Iowa coin flips.(From The Observer)Since the Democratic Party lost the 2016 presidential election, the party’s establishment has suppressed all calls for reform from progressives. Though the party appointed Sen. Bernie Sanders as its head of outreach, most Democrats continue to treat him and his supporters as unwelcome outsiders. In a recent speech, Sanders provided progressives with insight as to how to advance their values against an inept and increasingly out of touch Democratic Party.Click here for the article. http://www.againstcronycapitalism.org/

Just an attempt at humor. It made me laugh. Thanks to the reader who sent it.I dedicate this one to the Bernie folks who were the first ones to really highlight the crony relationships at the DNC. (The RNC has crony relationships too – just to be clear. But Clinton was an extraordinary case.) http://www.againstcronycapitalism.org/








We don’t know. That’s for the Justice Department to determine. But it doesn’t look good.(From Powerline)In any event, if Rice and others conspired to leak confidential information or publicly disclose information about individuals like General Flynn, it would be a crime.For an optimistic take on where the multiple Russia-related stories are heading, check out Kurt Schlichter’s piece at Townhall: “The Russiagate Scam Will Blow Up In The Democrats’ Smug Faces.”This part certainly seems correct:[I]t’s safe to say that there was absolutely no collusion of any kind between Team Trump and anyone Russian. None. How do I know this to a near certainty? Because we haven’t seen anybody leak any evidence of any in the six-plus months that they’ve been pushing this nonsense.Nothing. *** You think the geniuses leading our intelligence community – not the brave and dedicated folks in the trenches but the clowns and political suck-ups lording over them – could have or would have kept real collusion secret? Do you think if Trump was cavorting with the former commies we wouldn’t have heard about it from the NYT, the WaPo and the rest of the Democrat steno pool about a week before November 8th?Get. Real.Click here for the article. http://www.againstcronycapitalism.org/








This is one of the main reasons the establishment GOP so fought Trump. K Street knew that if Hillary won there would be plenty of lucrative work for Republican lobbyists of the Bushite mold. But if Trump got in all those carefully cultivated relationships might not be as valuable as the lobbyists thought. Indeed Trump might even close the access door. Who knew?Well, the access door has been closed on some of the old school DC wingtip types. But it has been opened to a new group. Power has its own gravitational pull.(From Politico)But those old connections don’t necessarily extend into Trump’s administration. Trump pitted himself against the GOP establishment during the campaign, and he singled out the influence industry for criticism. During his first week in office, he signed an executive order restricting his appointees from lobbying for domestic clients for five years after leaving the administration, and barring them from lobbying for foreign governments and political parties for life. The ban does not apply to former campaign officials who never joined the administration, such as Lewandowski.Click here for the article. http://www.againstcronycapitalism.org/








CNN is unbelievable and sadly believable at the same time. It is clearly now just a tool for propaganda.(From Grabien)At the top of Lemon’s show Monday night, the “CNN Tonight” anchor called the Rice report a “fake scandal ginned up by right-wing media and Trump” that he would not be baited into justifying with coverage.“On this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending,” it’s legitimate, he said. “Nor will we aid and abet the people trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion. Not going to do it.”Wow. There you have it.  CNN just jumped the propaganda shark completely. It is totally correct to call CNN “fake news.” It has been for a long time, but this is just amazing. Perhaps the most important story since the election but CNN wants to ignore it because it blows up its narrative.Not only does it blow up the Trump narrative to a large extent, it imperils Obama for whom CNN has long been an advocate.Click here for the article. http://www.againstcronycapitalism.org/








Buying expired domain names is one of the best ways to find investment-grade domain names at wholesale prices. Of course you’re likely not going to be the only person to find the name and if it’s a really good name you can expect to get into a bit of a bidding war to get the name. Since you never know who you’re bidding against all it takes is one end-user who is buying at a retail price to quickly move the auction from a good deal for an investor to a terrible one.Usually when you buy an expired domain you’re laser focused on getting the best price, what you might overlook is that the domain you bought might come with a bit of baggage beyond the price tag. I’ve learned this lesson before but saw it happen again just yesterday when I found a very official looking letter from a law firm in my mailbox. I opened the letter and it said that I had some website that was selling products with someone else’s name on it and they demanded that I stop…confusion set in.I emailed the firm back to figure out what they were talking about and it turns out they were referring to a website that was on the domain name years ago, i.e. before the domain expired and I acquired it. There’s no website on it now and I never put a site on it, but the domain came with some real baggage from the previous owner. In some cases it’s easy to figure out if the expired domain you are looking to buy comes with baggage, just do a Google search and see if anything funky comes up. If you ever get a demand letter or something similarly scary – make sure to find out if it actually refers to you and something that you’ve done with a domain, or if a previous tenant might not have been an upstanding citizen.So don’t be surprised if something like this happens to you someday, just don’t panic because it might not actually be referring to you! I’d say this is probably the second time in ten years that anything like this has happened to me so it certainly doesn’t seem to happen too often but it is a good reminder that expired domains can come with baggage.

Yes, the old adage of “if it seems too good to be true, it probably is” finally is starting to resonate in the lustful ménage a trois that Donald Trump brought to American politics with his populism courting the unlikely duet of conservatism and deplorable-jingoism. What seemed as a bountiful and exotic relationship to the leadership in the Republican Party is now appearing to be no more than a one night stand, and not the beginning of a long term relationship; reality becoming sobriety to an ephemeral night of GOP political lust. And as the repeal-replace of Obamacare fails in the House in its initial attempt (the bill in the house pulled being short of the necessary majority), it’s beginning to look as if Trump’s inaugural attempt as political deal-maker does bode ill for his egocentricity. Nor does it help Republican Party unity.

America’s ruling powers are practicing the trees vs. forest mind game as never before, with constant reminders given information consumers about how important a particular capitalist tree menace is, thereby avoiding awareness of how critical the capitalist forest menace has become. Now that the corporate circus of political lesser evilism has produced a genuine clown as its CEO the danger that his bumbling arrogance will reveal the sham and hypocrisy of the entire show is driving the owners of the big top to mass manipulations that drive their captive audience to desired distraction. But that could lead to a near—if not real—civil war if they succeed in destroying the clown while the circus continues on its death cycle, and that won’t be a laughing matter.

Sundance does not believe Assad is using chemical weapons on his own people in Syria. Sundance further believes that it is neo-cons who are giving Trump incorrect information.
With President Obama out of office; with President Trump not supportive of foreign policy based on regime change; and with Trump’s Secretary of State Tillerson saying just a few days ago that “Syrians will determine the future of Syria” the anti-Assad Syrians are now desperate.There is ZERO motive for President Bashir Assad to weaponize chemical weapons against his people. Assad’s forces are winning the war, Syria is more stable now than ever in the past six years, Assad has nothing to fear from a Trump administration, and using chemical weapons just doesn’t serve his interests. However, in their desperation, there is ample motive for the anti-Assad elements to give the appearance of ‘war-crimes’ in an effort to try and gain some desperate positioning in their remaining moments. Additionally, there is more than ample evidence the perpetual war machine, the Deep State and their alignment with global ideologues, would trigger such an optic.It is not accidental this happens right after Secretary Tillerson’s statement.…♦ First, only regime change, the removal of Bashir Assad, in Syria was the goal for President Obama. This is admitted and outlined by Secretary John Kerry.♦ Secondly, in order to accomplish this primary goal, the White House was willing to watch the rise of ISIS by placing their bet that ISIS’s success would force Syrian President Bashir Assad to acquiesce toward Obama’s terms and step down.♦ Thirdly, in order to facilitate the two objectives, Obama and Kerry intentionally gave arms to ISIS and even, arguably, attacked a Syrian government military convoy to stop a strategic attack upon the Islamic extremists killing 80 Syrian soldiers.…President Obama, Secretary Clinton and later Secretary Kerry, together with John McCain, and the CIA tentacled team within the Republican party, were willing to support ISIS (under all factional names) in order to overthrow Bashir Assad……THIS WAS THE POLICY.Read more here.








The answer is – both!Both are terrific platforms for promoting your business and that’s because they reach totally different audiences. In terms of advertising, you do not get a better one-two punch than Facebook and Google. Let’s break it down advertising nerd style. How Does Facebook Advertising Work?

Advertisers set a goal, deciding what they want for their business from the campaign, to:

Build online presence and encourage discovery.
Build brand awareness.
Generate leads for your business.
Boost sales by generating leads.
Encourage repeat sales and earn brand loyalty.


The advertiser targets a demographic – a group of people who you want to reach with your ad. There are several ways to do this.

Manually select your audiences based on demographics such as age group, geographic location, language and other criteria.
Custom audiences allows you to upload your contact list and connect with clients who are already using Facebook.
Look-alikes allows you to use your existing customer data to find people who are similar to them who are using Facebook.


Create a budget for your ad either per diem or over the lifetime of the campaign.
Create your ad with graphics or even video.
Once your ad is ready, you have several options on where to run your ad in the Facebook network. Your ads will be optimized for viewing on mobile or desktop.

Ads can be displayed on Facebook or Instagram.
Ads can also be displayed on Facebook’s Audience Network which can display ads on mobile apps, mobile optimized websites, and in videos.


Ad performance can be measured through several management options available on Facebook.

 How does Google Adwords Work?
Google AdWords is a little more complicated. People hear the words “pay per click” and think that they will simply pay a fixed cost for each user who clicks on their ads. They also hear “keyword auction” and think that the company with the biggest ad spend wins. Instead it’s more like a mathematical equation. This is how the auction really works.Maximum Bid / Content Quality Score = Ad RankNow let’s break that down a little further.This is where you really need to work with an experienced advertising professional, as well as a SEO specialist, and maybe even a Web designer. Google is looking at your website for fresh, high-quality content, optimization for mobile, and relevancy to the keywords that you’re using. Why work with professionals? Because they know how to make that advertising spend work for you. It doesn’t matter how much you have, it’s how you use it. A small company with a smaller advertising budget working with professionals accustomed to dealing with smaller businesses can actually get a great result high up on the search engine results page.Professionals take your advertising as seriously as you do and want you to get the best bang possible for your advertising buck. When you hire professionals to create beautiful, relevant, and eye-catching ads and even entire campaigns, you are enhancing your brand and making it memorable.  Find out for yourself just how much your traffic can increase, get a terrific return on investment, and discover healthier and happier bottom line. See for yourself the difference that dedicated professionals can make.Mansi Rana is managing director and story teller at EZ Rankings.

According to Buckminster Fuller’s ‘Knowledge Doubling Curve’ human knowledge doubled approximately every century. Today, it is estimated that human knowledge is doubling every 12 to 13 months. IBM is estimating that with the build out of the “Internet of things,” knowledge will double every 12 hours.The explosion of information is clearly accelerating. Data is flooding companies and the problem is only getting worse. As the next big explosion heats up, “the Internet of things” — when our machines talk to each other — rate of information growth will go exponential.Data is quickly becoming one of the most critical business assets. The challenge most leaders face at this point is how to monetize their ocean of data. Having masses of information is of little value unless it is leveraged to give the company a competitive edge. Below are five key steps leaders should take to monetize their company’s data assets: 1. Decision Architecture
When thinking about analytics, most organizations think about the questions that answer how their business is performing and what information they gather to answer the question.  While this helps to inform and describe what is occurring in the organization, it does not enable action.  Rather, leaders should look to capture the decision architecture of a particular business problem and build analytical capability to develop diagnostics that enable decisions and, therefore, actions. In short, leaders should focus on decisions driven by data rather than simply asking questions of their data. This is a fundamental shift in how most organizations view analytics and is the key component to driving the maturity of companies higher on the analytical maturity curve. 2. Monetization Strategy
Develop monetization strategies and maintain them as valuable corporate assets. In the same way an organization might develop KPIs to help manage and understand business performance, monetization strategies leveraging corporate data assets that drive competitive advantage should be developed continuously. The power of a good monetization strategy is the ability to take a good decision and make it a great one. A monetization strategy is a plan to achieve one or more business goals through tactics or actions that have a quantified benefit. They should be developed from your decision architecture and linked to your corporate business levers that align strategic objectives. 3. Data Science and Decision Theory
Use both data science and decision theory to power your monetization strategy.  Data science helps you derive insights from your data to address a particular business problem or opportunity, whereas data science helps turn information into actionable insights. Decision theory helps you structure the decision process to guide a person to the correct choice. Decision theory, along with behavioral economics, is focused on understanding the components of the decision process to explain why we make the choices we do. It provides a systematic way to consider tradeoffs among attributes that helps us make better decisions. 4. Analytical Structure
Data is the lifeblood of any analytical exercise and usually one of the bigger challenges. Sourcing, organizing and stitching together data is typically where a large amount of time is spent in building an analytical solution. When putting together datasets for analytics, the quality of the data is key. If the data is missing, incorrect, or inconsistent, the results of the analysis will be unclear or worse, incorrect. Once the data is compiled, determining the right analytical structure is important for performance, integrity and scalability for your monetization strategy. 5. Repeatability and Scalability
Building one-off analytical solutions are more the norm for corporate America. Hours are poured into solving difficult problems to capture a revenue opportunity, only to have the analytics lie dormant or never used again. Leaders should look to develop monetization strategies that are automated, repeatable and scalable throughout their organization. This approach will lead to analytics that other departments can utilize versus having to build their own version.These five key components will enable you to build monetization strategies and analytical solutions that help managers and executives navigate the vast amounts of data to make quality decisions that drive revenue.  Building capabilities around each of these five keys will give your organization the power to tap into the value of your data and build analytical solutions that give your company a competitive edge.Andrew Roman Wells is the CEO of Aspirent, a management-consulting firm focused on analytics.

Cotton clothing has a longstanding history of being all-natural and wholesome. Unfortunately, times have changed, and once you delve behind-the-scenes of the cotton industry, its wholesome image quickly frays around the edges.
Most people forget that a vast majority — about 90 to 95 percent1 — of non-organic cotton clothing is made from Monsanto’s genetically engineered (GE) cotton. Organic cotton, grown in a sustainable, non-toxic manner, accounts for a mere 1 percent of the global cotton production.
You may be boycotting genetically modified organisms (GMOs), but if you’re still buying non-organic cotton clothes and other items made from cotton, be it towels, drapes or tampons, you’re still feeding the beast.
You’re also exposing yourself to potentially heavy doses of toxins, contributing to ever-worsening environmental destruction, and enabling human rights violations.2
 Cotton — One of the Most Toxic Crops on the Planet
Its toxicity is perhaps one of the most surprising findings you’ll discover when researching the conventional cotton industry.
While making up less than 2.5 percent of global cropland, non-organic cotton receives 16 to 25 percent of all insecticides,3 10 percent of all pesticides4 and nearly 7 percent of all herbicides used worldwide, many of which are among the most hazardous.5
Herbicide-resistant GE cotton is typically sprayed with copious amounts of Roundup, the active ingredient in which is glyphosate, a likely human carcinogen.
The 2002 introduction of Bt cotton, which is genetically engineered to produce its own internal pesticide, was supposed to lead to a reduction in the use of insecticides. In reality, Bt cotton actually requires more pesticide sprayings than indigenous cotton, as it has created new chemical-resistant pests.
To control these resistant pests, farmers now use 13 times more pesticides than they were using prior to the introduction of Bt cotton.6
Moreover, in addition to being heavily contaminated with topical pesticides, the Bt cotton is itself a pesticide as well — it’s even registered as such7 — since Bt toxin is produced in every cell of the plant.
 Uzbekistan’s Cotton Industry Is a Modern Form of Slavery
The featured video, “White Gold — The True Cost of Cotton” created by the Environmental Justice Foundation, reveals the gross human rights violations occurring in Uzbekistan, the second largest cotton exporter in the world, and how the cotton industry has created an environmental catastrophe of unbelievable proportions.
Here, one-third of the population, including children as young as 7, labor for the government-owned cotton industry. Schools close during harvest time, and teachers bring the children to the cotton fields instead. Students who refuse to pick cotton may lose their schooling privileges.
Teachers risk being fired from their teaching jobs unless they comply with the mandatory cotton-picking each year, and public protests are beat back with lethal force.
No protective gear is provided. Everyone picks cotton with bare hands, ensuring exposure to toxic pesticides. Lack of drinking water forces laborers to drink from the irrigation canals — water that not only may be contaminated with chemicals, but also disease-causing pathogens.
At the end of the harvest season, many workers end up being deeper in debt to the state than before they began. They simply aren’t able to pick enough cotton to offset the expenses for food and lodging the government deducts from their earnings.
 Environmental Catastrophe in Uzbekistan
In addition to being chemical-dependent, non-organic cotton also needs water — lots of water. Enough to drain a sea in a few decades.
The water level of the Aral Sea — situated between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan — began receding in the early 1970s. Fish also started dying from the chemical runoff from the fields. Aral Sea fishermen of old used to catch 40 tons of fish per year. Today, the area is littered with fishing vessels lying on dry land.
What used to be a thriving seaport is now nearly 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the water’s edge, and the fishing economy has been obliterated.
The former seabed is heavily contaminated with salt and pesticides, both of which prevent plant growth, and wind-driven toxic dust has led to high rates of cancer and tuberculosis. This is the hidden human and environmental sticker price for cotton.
 Cotton Industry Is Notorious for Human Rights Violations
Similar human rights violations and environmental tragedies are found in other cotton-producing nations.
In India, an estimated 300,000 farmers have also committed suicide in the past two decades8 — deaths attributed to despair over unsurmountable debt created by Monsanto’s patented seed scheme, which prohibits saving and sharing of seeds and requires the use of expensive chemicals.
As noted in “Our Cotton Colonies” by In These Times, which starts out by highlighting the often-violent history of the cotton trade and then details the modern-day cotton life cycle from field to sales rack:9
“The T-shirts we buy at retailers like Gap and H&M may feel far removed from the bloody past of a crop synonymous in the 19th century with slavery and sweatshops.

But when one follows the global supply chain of cotton growers, workers, traders and factory owners, it becomes increasingly apparent that capitalism has not, in fact, traveled far at all from its bloody origins.”

It’s a fascinating read, and I encourage you to review it, but don’t expect to feel good about that stack of jeans and cotton T-shirts in your closet when you’re done.
 Conventional Cotton Production Is Toxic Business
The environmental assaults don’t end when the cotton leaves the field. The process necessary to turn raw cotton into cotton yarn and fabric involves another round of toxic exposures that result in environmental pollution. The Organic Trade Association explains:10
“During the conversion of cotton into conventional clothing, many hazardous materials are used and added to the product, including silicone waxes, harsh petroleum scours, softeners, heavy metals, flame and soil retardants, ammonia and formaldehyde — just to name a few.

Many processing stages result in large amounts of toxic wastewater that carry away residues from chemical cleaning, dyeing and finishing. This waste depletes the oxygen out of the water, killing aquatic animals and disrupting aquatic ecosystems. The North American Organic Fiber Processing Standards prohibits these and similar chemicals.”

 Cotton in Our Food Supply
While you cannot eat cotton per se, 65 percent of conventional cotton production still ends up in the food chain, through:11

Cottonseed oil, a primary ingredient in Crisco cooking oil and vitamin E supplements
Cottonseed meal, added to dairy cow and beef cattle feed
Cotton cellulose, used as a non-caloric filler, thickener and stabilizer in a wide range of processed foods and beverages

The toxic pesticides sprayed on conventional cotton crops also threaten the health of, and contaminate, other food crops. In Texas, winegrowers fear the approval of new herbicide-resistant cotton crops may wipe out the wine industry altogether. Such dire predictions stem from the fact that pesticides drift wherever the wind blows, and vineyards cannot tolerate the herbicide mixtures now being used on GE plants such as cotton.
Paul Bonarrigo, who owns a vineyard in Hale County, has been unable to produce grapes for the past two years in a row. They keep dying from chemical damage — damage that will only get worse as cotton plantations in the area start planting the next-generation GE cotton resistant to dicamba and 2,4-D. As reported by The Texas Tribune:12
“Other Texas winegrowers have seen similar damage, and they blame it on dicamba and 2,4-D, two high-volatility herbicides commonly used on cereal crops, pastures and lawns. Now, the state’s vintners are alarmed that use of the chemicals may soon expand to include 3.7 million acres of cotton fields in the High Plains, where cotton is being invaded by weeds immune to the Roundup pesticide long used.”

 Are Your Tampons Full of Roundup?
Cotton is not only used for clothing, of course. In addition to linens, towels, furniture coverings and drapes, women may also be using cotton tampons. A 2016 investigation13 by a French magazine found traces of harmful chemicals in 11 brand name tampons and sanitary pads, including dioxins, organochlorine pesticides — including glyphosate — and pyrethroid insecticides.
Considering the high probability of cotton being contaminated with pesticides and insecticides, I encourage you, whenever possible, to choose “USDA Certified 100% Organic” cotton tampons. Bt cotton is a particularly questionable choice for tampons, since it contains both internally-produced toxin and topically applied chemicals. Another safer alternative is the Diva Cup, which works in a similar way as a diaphragm, allowing you to avoid tampons altogether.
 Pimacott Resorts to DNA Tagging to Track Cotton Origins
Unfortunately, it’s easy to support human rights violations and environmental destruction even when you’re a contentious consumer. You basically have to trust the company you’re buying from, and while many will do their best to source cotton responsibly, there’s no way to really identify the origin of a piece of cotton. Fraud also exists even in the organic industry.
For example, seven years ago, Swedish fashion giant H&M was caught in a scandal when testing revealed 30 percent of its “organic” cotton contained genetically modified material. All of the questionable cotton came from India, one of the world’s largest producers of organic cotton, which suggests the fraudulent labeling was probably occurring at other retailers as well.
To ensure the authenticity and purity of its product, Pimacott has developed a novel DNA tagging technology that allows you to verify the origin of its cotton. Pimacott is the developer of pima cotton, grown primarily in the San Joaquin Valley in California and certain Peruvian regions. As noted by David Greenstein, CEO of Himatsingka America Inc., of which Pimacott is a trademark:14
“In the industry, there was an increasing discrepancy between what was written on the package of a cotton product and what the material was actually made of … We decided that we were going to use technology to change the way that we source cotton and take control of our supply chain.”

Together with the technology firm Applied DNA Sciences, the company has developed a DNA tag for its cotton — a microscopic marker on every grain of cotton that can be read by a DNA scanner, much like you’d read a package barcode. As explained in the featured article:15
“This insertion process happens at the gin [editor’s note: a cotton gin is a machine that separates the fibers from the seed]: Little molecules are released into the cotton and permanently bind to it. From this point onward, it is possible to place a piece of cotton or fabric under a simple DNA scanner to see whether the marker is present.”

 Cotton-Blend Fabrics and Microfiber Pollution
Cotton-blend fabrics also contribute to environmental pollution by introducing microfibers into waterways. Synthetic fabrics such as acrylic and polyester are the primary culprits here, but cotton-blend fabrics are also best avoided.
In a comparison of acrylic, polyester and a polyester-cotton blend, acrylic was the worst, shedding microfibers up to four times faster than the polyester-cotton blend16,17 Still, your “cleanest” option in this regard is 100 percent organic cotton fabrics, as the synthetic fibers in these other fabrics pose severe hazards to water quality and the survival of sea life.
According to estimates by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, up to 1.7 million tons of microfibers enter the ocean each and every year.18 In some ocean waters, plastic exceeds plankton by a factor of 6-to-1,19 and the fibers have been found in both table salt20 and various seafood sold for human consumption.21
Testing reveals 90 percent of freshwater and saltwater fish have microfiber debris in their bodies,22,23 and since these fibers act like sponges, they soak up and concentrate toxins like PCBs and pesticides. As a result, the fish become even more toxic than they normally would be simply by swimming in polluted water.
 Cleaning Up Your Wardrobe in the Name of Humanitarianism
While some companies are actively investigating ways to produce more environmentally-friendly clothing, each and every one of us can contribute to the solution by curbing your consumption and giving more thought to what you buy and how you care for your items.
As described in my previous article on “fast fashion,” the entire life cycle of a piece of clothing would ideally be taken into account before buying, as most of your discarded clothes actually end up in landfills, or are resold to developing countries where local clothing industries then suffer instead.
To avoid toxic chemicals, reduce environmental pollution and promote safe and fair labor rights across the world, consider the following recommendations when it comes to buying clothing and other fabric-related items:



Opt for organic cotton, hemp, silk, wool and bamboo fabrics. While such items typically cost more than non-organic cotton and synthetics, buying fewer items will allow you to spend more on each item. On the upside, higher quality organic items tend to last far longer with proper care, so you get your money’s worth in the end.


Opt for items colored with nontoxic, natural dyes when possible. Businesses investing in organic farming and natural dyes include PACT (undergarments and loungewear), Boll & Branch (bed linens, blankets and towels), Jungmaven (organic hemp and cotton T-shirts), Industry of All Nations (clothing) and many others.


Avoid screen printed items, as they typically contain phthalates.


Look for the Bluesign System Certification,24 which tells you the item has been manufactured with a minimal amount of hazardous chemicals, or none.


Avoid trademarked technical fabrics, as most are coated with chemicals that will eventually wash out.


Be mindful of when and how you wash synthetic clothing. Wash synthetic clothing as irregularly as possible using a mild detergent. Line dry instead of putting them in the dryer. The heat and agitation will break down fibers. Handwashing or using the gentle cycle with cold water will also minimize the shedding of fibers, as will using a front loading washing machine.
Avoid commercial fabric softeners and dryer sheets. Not only do they release potentially toxic chemicals into wastewater and air (through the dryer vent), they also leave a film on the fabric that decreases the wicking ability of the fiber.



Install a microfiber filter on your washing machine. Wexco is currently the exclusive distributor of the Filtrol 160 filter,25designed to capture non-biodegradable fibers from your washing machine discharge. Here is a link to Google to find sources for them.

Similar human rights violations and environmental tragedies are found in other cotton-producing nations.In India, an estimated 300,000 farmers have also committed suicide in the past two decades8 — deaths attributed to despair over unsurmountable debt created by Monsanto’s patented seed scheme, which prohibits saving and sharing of seeds and requires the use of expensive chemicals.As noted in “Our Cotton Colonies” by In These Times, which starts out by highlighting the often-violent history of the cotton trade and then details the modern-day cotton life cycle from field to sales rack:9“The T-shirts we buy at retailers like Gap and H&M may feel far removed from the bloody past of a crop synonymous in the 19th century with slavery and sweatshops.But when one follows the global supply chain of cotton growers, workers, traders and factory owners, it becomes increasingly apparent that capitalism has not, in fact, traveled far at all from its bloody origins.”It’s a fascinating read, and I encourage you to review it, but don’t expect to feel good about that stack of jeans and cotton T-shirts in your closet when you’re done. Conventional Cotton Production Is Toxic Business
The environmental assaults don’t end when the cotton leaves the field. The process necessary to turn raw cotton into cotton yarn and fabric involves another round of toxic exposures that result in environmental pollution. The Organic Trade Association explains:10“During the conversion of cotton into conventional clothing, many hazardous materials are used and added to the product, including silicone waxes, harsh petroleum scours, softeners, heavy metals, flame and soil retardants, ammonia and formaldehyde — just to name a few.Many processing stages result in large amounts of toxic wastewater that carry away residues from chemical cleaning, dyeing and finishing. This waste depletes the oxygen out of the water, killing aquatic animals and disrupting aquatic ecosystems. The North American Organic Fiber Processing Standards prohibits these and similar chemicals.” Cotton in Our Food Supply
While you cannot eat cotton per se, 65 percent of conventional cotton production still ends up in the food chain, through:11The toxic pesticides sprayed on conventional cotton crops also threaten the health of, and contaminate, other food crops. In Texas, winegrowers fear the approval of new herbicide-resistant cotton crops may wipe out the wine industry altogether. Such dire predictions stem from the fact that pesticides drift wherever the wind blows, and vineyards cannot tolerate the herbicide mixtures now being used on GE plants such as cotton.Paul Bonarrigo, who owns a vineyard in Hale County, has been unable to produce grapes for the past two years in a row. They keep dying from chemical damage — damage that will only get worse as cotton plantations in the area start planting the next-generation GE cotton resistant to dicamba and 2,4-D. As reported by The Texas Tribune:12“Other Texas winegrowers have seen similar damage, and they blame it on dicamba and 2,4-D, two high-volatility herbicides commonly used on cereal crops, pastures and lawns. Now, the state’s vintners are alarmed that use of the chemicals may soon expand to include 3.7 million acres of cotton fields in the High Plains, where cotton is being invaded by weeds immune to the Roundup pesticide long used.” Are Your Tampons Full of Roundup?
Cotton is not only used for clothing, of course. In addition to linens, towels, furniture coverings and drapes, women may also be using cotton tampons. A 2016 investigation13 by a French magazine found traces of harmful chemicals in 11 brand name tampons and sanitary pads, including dioxins, organochlorine pesticides — including glyphosate — and pyrethroid insecticides.Considering the high probability of cotton being contaminated with pesticides and insecticides, I encourage you, whenever possible, to choose “USDA Certified 100% Organic” cotton tampons. Bt cotton is a particularly questionable choice for tampons, since it contains both internally-produced toxin and topically applied chemicals. Another safer alternative is the Diva Cup, which works in a similar way as a diaphragm, allowing you to avoid tampons altogether. Pimacott Resorts to DNA Tagging to Track Cotton Origins
Unfortunately, it’s easy to support human rights violations and environmental destruction even when you’re a contentious consumer. You basically have to trust the company you’re buying from, and while many will do their best to source cotton responsibly, there’s no way to really identify the origin of a piece of cotton. Fraud also exists even in the organic industry.For example, seven years ago, Swedish fashion giant H&M was caught in a scandal when testing revealed 30 percent of its “organic” cotton contained genetically modified material. All of the questionable cotton came from India, one of the world’s largest producers of organic cotton, which suggests the fraudulent labeling was probably occurring at other retailers as well.To ensure the authenticity and purity of its product, Pimacott has developed a novel DNA tagging technology that allows you to verify the origin of its cotton. Pimacott is the developer of pima cotton, grown primarily in the San Joaquin Valley in California and certain Peruvian regions. As noted by David Greenstein, CEO of Himatsingka America Inc., of which Pimacott is a trademark:14“In the industry, there was an increasing discrepancy between what was written on the package of a cotton product and what the material was actually made of … We decided that we were going to use technology to change the way that we source cotton and take control of our supply chain.”Together with the technology firm Applied DNA Sciences, the company has developed a DNA tag for its cotton — a microscopic marker on every grain of cotton that can be read by a DNA scanner, much like you’d read a package barcode. As explained in the featured article:15“This insertion process happens at the gin [editor’s note: a cotton gin is a machine that separates the fibers from the seed]: Little molecules are released into the cotton and permanently bind to it. From this point onward, it is possible to place a piece of cotton or fabric under a simple DNA scanner to see whether the marker is present.” Cotton-Blend Fabrics and Microfiber Pollution
Cotton-blend fabrics also contribute to environmental pollution by introducing microfibers into waterways. Synthetic fabrics such as acrylic and polyester are the primary culprits here, but cotton-blend fabrics are also best avoided.In a comparison of acrylic, polyester and a polyester-cotton blend, acrylic was the worst, shedding microfibers up to four times faster than the polyester-cotton blend16,17 Still, your “cleanest” option in this regard is 100 percent organic cotton fabrics, as the synthetic fibers in these other fabrics pose severe hazards to water quality and the survival of sea life.According to estimates by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, up to 1.7 million tons of microfibers enter the ocean each and every year.18 In some ocean waters, plastic exceeds plankton by a factor of 6-to-1,19 and the fibers have been found in both table salt20 and various seafood sold for human consumption.21Testing reveals 90 percent of freshwater and saltwater fish have microfiber debris in their bodies,22,23 and since these fibers act like sponges, they soak up and concentrate toxins like PCBs and pesticides. As a result, the fish become even more toxic than they normally would be simply by swimming in polluted water. Cleaning Up Your Wardrobe in the Name of Humanitarianism
While some companies are actively investigating ways to produce more environmentally-friendly clothing, each and every one of us can contribute to the solution by curbing your consumption and giving more thought to what you buy and how you care for your items.As described in my previous article on “fast fashion,” the entire life cycle of a piece of clothing would ideally be taken into account before buying, as most of your discarded clothes actually end up in landfills, or are resold to developing countries where local clothing industries then suffer instead.To avoid toxic chemicals, reduce environmental pollution and promote safe and fair labor rights across the world, consider the following recommendations when it comes to buying clothing and other fabric-related items:Avoid commercial fabric softeners and dryer sheets. Not only do they release potentially toxic chemicals into wastewater and air (through the dryer vent), they also leave a film on the fabric that decreases the wicking ability of the fiber.








Grab the tissues. This video nearly had the Cassini team all choked up during today’s press briefing, and virtual sobs and sniffs were abundant on social media posts sharing the video. “We get goosebumps and get emotional every time we see it,” said Earl Maize, Cassini project manager at JPL. On April 22 the Cassini spacecraft will begin its ‘Grand Finale’ — the beginning of the end of this tremendous mission that has provided breathtaking images and so many new discoveries of Saturn, its rings and moons. The mission will end on September 15, 2017, when it makes a dramatic plunge into the gas giant.Here’s the video that had everyone teary-eyed. Be prepared for some stunning visuals: Today, Maize talked about how nineteen countries and three space agencies contributed to the success of the Cassini/Huygens mission, saying the mission has been truly an international triumph and a phenomenal achievement.“Cassini’s legacy is assured. We are in the books!” Maize said. “But the best is yet to come. We are going to dive into the gap between the rings of Saturn and Saturn’s atmosphere, a place where no spacecraft has ever gone. We’ll be going 70,000 mph (112,634 km/hr) into a 1,500-mile-wide (2,400-kilometer) gap, operating the spacecraft from a billion miles away.”Cassini has been a relatively trouble free mission, and has made many discoveries about the Saturn system. So why crash the spacecraft? Cassini is running out of fuel, basically running on fumes at this point.* And NASA needs to follow the protocol of planetary protection, and not allow a spacecraft with possible microbes from Earth to crash into a potentially habitable moon such as Enceladus or Titan.“Cassini’s own discoveries were its demise,” Maize said. “Enceladus has a warm, salt water ocean. We can’t risk an inadvertent contact with this pristine body. The only choice was to destroy it (Cassini) in a designed fashion.”Maize said that back in 2010, the team decided they would make the mission last as long as possible and use every last kilogram of propellant to explore the Saturn system as thoroughly as they could. Cassini vs. Saturn. As depicted in this illustration, Cassini will plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere on Sept. 15, 2017. Using its attitude control thrusters, the spacecraft will work to keep its antenna pointed at Earth while it sends its final data, including the composition of Saturn’s upper atmosphere. Credit: NASA/JPL-CaltechThe final flyby of Titan on April 22 will ultimately alter Cassini’s trajectory and push it toward the spacecraft’s final demise. Maize described the gravity slingshot from Titan as a “last kiss goodbye that will push Cassini into Saturn. This is a roller coaster ride that we’re not coming out of.”You can plot Cassini’s trajectory in JPL’s “Eyes on Cassini” special section of their Eyes on the Solar System website. Cassini will make 22 passes through the gap, and in doing so, further our understanding of how giant planets, and planetary systems everywhere, form and evolve.Project Scientist Linda Spilker said Cassini will be able to make close up measurements of Saturn and its rings to finally help us understand the mass and internal structure of Saturn. And the images should be absolutely stunning. There’s the risk of dust or debris hitting the spacecraft, potentially crippling Cassini. But the risk is worth it, because if the spacecraft survives through even just a few of the close passes, the scientific payback will be incredible. However, even if the spacecraft is crippled and can’t send back its final science observations, the end is inevitable, as the path toward destruction will be written by the final ‘kiss’ from Titan. “This is something we couldn’t try at any other time,” Maize said. “But now is time.”A computer-generated representation of all Cassini’s Saturn orbits -affectionately called the “ball of yarn” by mission planners. The time frame spans Saturn Orbit Insertion on July 1, 2004 to the end of mission on Sept. 15, 2017. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech.The Cassini team said the end of the mission will likely be a combination of excitement, pride and a sense of loss. “I think that once the signal is lost, it would mean the heartbeat of Cassini is gone,” said Spilker. “I think there will be tremendous cheers and applause for the completion of an absolutely incredible mission. Hugs, tears — the Kleenex box will be passed around — but we will rejoice at being part of such a wonderful mission.”See more images and information about the Grand Finale here.

As for the bipropellant that runs the main engines, that’s a little more unknown and the one the team is worried most about running out of fuel. The team member said there is about 10 kg of that fuel left, “plus or minus 20 kilos. We could run out today, or we could have 30 kilos left.” The post Cassini’s Final Mission to Annihilation Starts April 22 appeared first on Universe Today.








Sundance writes at The Conservative Treehouse,
With dozens of people with access to President Obama’s PDB, Rice’s unmasking of the intelligence report names gave dozens of people direct access to unmasked intelligence – including Obama officials who could, perhaps did, use the PDB for specific and intentional political purposes, as outlined by Evelyn Farkas who was one of the recipients of the unmasked intelligence.If you know how concentric circle political safety is constructed, you will notice that Susan Rice is now hugging the security of the Presidency. No space. To take Rice down, means to take down President Obama – safe play on her part.Reverse the safety. No-one in media or congress is going to allow President Obama to be taken down; ergo, everyone will protect Susan Rice. They have no choice.Read the whole thing here.

As SB10, a bill sponsored by state Senator Rob Bradley (R) and fully backed by Senate President Joe Negron (R), creeps through the committee hearing process in the Florida Legislature, more federally elected Republican officials are weighing in with their concerns over the proposed state land buy of private property.Several weeks back U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R) first sounded the alarm about how a state government buy out of private farmland would adversely affect those individuals living in the region.“What about the people that live in those communities? What about Pahokee, what about those cities in the glades communities that are going to get wiped out…If you buy up all that farmland, that means there’s no farming, that means these cities collapse, they basically turning ghost towns. Shouldn’t they be at the table? Shouldn’t they be part of this conversation as well?”Rubio told Senator Negron that there was “no federal money for it” because any money set aside to subsidize SB10 would take away funding for other issues and programs.”- Sen. Marco Rubio (R)Now Freshman U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz (R) has just called Negron’s land buy initiative of being nothing more than eminent domain.  Gaetz made his remarks during  a sit down interview with the Shark Tank in Washington, D.C.For Republicans in Florida, being labeled as someone who supports the use of eminent domain is just as damaging as being called a Charlie Crist Republican.Eminent domain is the epitome of big government overreach and the trampling of individual rights.There is no funding for it (SB10). Senate bill 10 relies on an assumption that is a fiction, that somehow the federal government will come in and fund a substantial element of the plan. That’s not going to happen, if anything, the debate and discussion that is occurring in Florida makes it harder for us to get the funding that is absolutely needed  to complete existing projects that have been in the pipeline for awhile.The other interesting thing to note is that this land isn’t for sale. The owners of the land have said its not for sale, repeatedly, and they’re pretty credible in these claims.And so the only way to affect senate’s plan is to utilize eminent domain, and that is something that should concern everybody who believes in the Constitution and individual rights when you got property owners that can be deprived of their land simply because someone is trying to make a political point in Tallahassee.”- Rep. Matt Gaetz (R)Its either eminent domain or there is a willing seller. Someone show me a willing seller, and I will no longer accuse anyone of setting up a eminent domain claim. But there is no willing seller.Right now you have the Florida Senate hell bent to buy up a bunch of land that isn’t for sale, and is reliant of federal money that will never come.Gaetz’s fellow Floridian, Rep. Daniel Webster (R), who believes that the federal government has more pressing issues to worry about than this kind of funding, says that now is not the “right” time for SB10.I think we got our own problems right now and we have other priorities right this second, but there may be a day, and I’d have to look at the , benefits tied to it, but basically, not right now.-Rep. Daniel Webster (R)Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), who says  SB10 hasn’t been on his radar, echoed what Webster said in that there was “so much other stuff” members of Congress needed to focus on.Other members of Congress and their staff, like Utah Congressman Rob Bishop (R), see things like  DeSantis and either don’t see SB10 as a priority, or don’t much about the bill to even comment about it.Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R) furnished the following statement supporting the existing and ongoing Everglades clean-up efforts.“As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and founder of the Everglades Caucus, Everglades restoration is a top priority. My focus will be to continue funding the projects in the Army Corps’ integrated delivery schedule.”-Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R)On the other side of land  buyout initiative is the Everglades Foundation. The foundation’s CEO Erik Eikenberg, a former Charlie Crist Republican, praised the recent amendment Senator Negron added as a quick fix to SB10.“President Negron’s amendment moves us closer than ever before to our goals of greater water storage south of Lake Okeechobee, massive reductions of algae-causing discharges and improvements in the quality of water entering the Everglades and Florida Bay. It fulfills our objectives of moving more water south, and by prioritizing the use of land already owned by the state, it reduces the need for bonding.“We are pleased that the legislation will compel the South Florida Water Management District to prioritize storage south of Lake Okeechobee — something that we have urged for years.“The amendment will also provide an additional $100 million to expedite the reservoir and existing projects already underway.”The Everglades Foundation does have one Republican congressman it can call a friend, Rep. Brian Mast.Mast recent congressional run was “anchored” on cleaning up and preserving Florida waterways from pollution like the nutrient-filled run-off that has caused massive algae blooms throughout the state.Mast, who is no friend to the sugar industry, has given Negron’s land buy proposal a full-throated endorsement, leaving many of his conservative Republican colleagues in the House to continue question his conservative bona fides. One member, who asked that his name be kept out of this story, said that Mast appears to have “kissed the ring” when he asked his colleagues to support the recent “Republican version of Obamacare” bill, the American Health Care Act.“One of the most important things that we can do to save our coastal waters and our coastal estuaries is making sure we find ways to move the water south.That’s why I support SB 10 and it’s why the first action I took when I got to Congress was securing a spot as Vice Chairman of the Water Resources and Environment subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  In this role, I am pushing to secure the federal support and funding needed to restore our environment and protect the economy.”-Rep. Brian Mast (R)The post Florida Senate’s SB 10 Labeled As Being “Eminent Domain” appeared first on Shark Tank.

Democrats will swear up and down that tax cuts will only benefit the wealthy and that they will never lead to a single job. Two families, iconic in America for generations, have just proven that to be false. The Rothschilds and the Gettys, with a combined net worth of more than $400 billion, have committed to spending buckets of their own dollars to create a million jobs.The two families are joining forces to help build new infrastructure for clean coal and safe fracking companies as well as new pipelines to span the country from the oil-rich tundras of Alaska to the deep-water rigs of the gulf. Under president Trump’s new affordable energy initiative, the new Roth-Getty Corporation, as it will be called, will secure a future for a million Americans.The initiative, which would guarantee the company tax-free operation for the first five years and subsidize the cost of the jobs for another 15, will ensure that the company is able to continue to grow and hire more people. The cost of the program is being offset with cuts to unnecessary social programs like The national Endowment for the Arts and public Broadcasting. These programs in the past have been nothing but a strain on the economy. If liberal elitists want to paint, sculpt and broadcast lies about our President, they can pay for it themselves.And THAT is called making America Great Again!








A pair of liberal activists, famous for their roles in the Black Lives Matter thuggery, were shot dead by the Secret Service. The pair were holed up in an apartment in New York City planning an attack on Trump Tower when a tactical team attempted to serve an arrest warrant and apprehend them.According to Breitbart:The Secret Service obtained intel that implicated LaShaun DeMarcus and George Maclerius Smith, two high-ranking members of BLM, as ringleaders of a domestic terrorism cell planning to kidnap First Lady Melania Trump.The pair refused to be taken into custody and fired on the agents, who had no choice but to use deadly force. The First Lady and her son, Baron, have been evacuated and taken to an undisclosed location.A manifesto found inside the apartment reads:We do what we do because Trump supporters are idiots. We will continbue to make them look foolish from now until the end of time.Nobody is sure how that statement relates to the kidnapping.








Bruce Jenner, a staunch conservative and life-long member of the Republican party, has finally come to his senses after several years of what had to be agonizing confusion. He has decided that he no longer wants to be a “woman” named Caitlyn.Jenner was just released from a voluntary treatment program offered by his church to help remove the demons and reverse the lies Satan has instilled in homosexuals, lesbians and cross-dressers. Through the miracle of prayer and acceptance of God’s love, Bruce Jenner is himself again and embracing living out his days as a man. Jenner told MSNBC:“I knew when Trump won that things in America were changing and I decided that I would have to get help for my mental issues. I am not a woman in a man’s body, I’m Bruce Jenner, Olympic gold medalist and father. God helped me realize that the truth will set us all free.”Jenner plans to write a book about his experiences and to tour the country talking to other tortured souls who have decided to take the life God gave them and change it to something only a liberal can understand. Together with his children, he says, he’ll be able to overcome the damage he’s done by pretending to be something he’s not.This is just more proof that God exists and that if you ask Him for help, you will be redeemed. God bless you, Bruce Jenner. And God Bless the USA and President Trump.








Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) just signed the death warrant for his own career. President Trump, in the spirit of unifying the party, asked McConnell to lead the charge on re-writing the Republican health care bill that will replace Obamacare.Rather than take the great honor bestowed on him, McConnell instead ran to the Democrats and started collecting THEIR ideas on how to fix the health care bill. An aide inside McConnell’s office told The Hill that the senator recognizes that the Democrats have a much better grasp on what the people want when it comes to health care and that working with them is the only way to ensure a positive outcome.McConnell is a traitor. Soon after the calls went out to leading Democrats, he had a meeting in his office with Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s top aide. McConnell has obviously decided that he wants to be on the wrong side of history.








Barack Obama spent more time golfing than any other president in history. When all was said and done, the golfer-in-chief had spent 264 days of his 8-year reign of terror on the links at the taxpayer expense.President Trump had a special investigator look into the cost of all that golf to the taxpayer. After figuring in greens fees, transportation, security, food, beverages and equipment, the final cost came to just over $1 billion.You heard that right. $1 billion for one man to walk around luxury country clubs all over the world playing a game he’s not all that good at to begin with.The office of the comptroller will be sending Obama a bill that will have him paying back more than $400 million of that money that can’t be justified as a typical expense for a president. Obama has some nerve costing all of that money when he surely could have played much less and paid for a lot of it himself.








In an unprecedented move to make America safer and end the reign of terror being perpetrated by the shadow government, congress just sent an emergency bill to president Trump’s desk to outlaw Barack Obama’s Deep State.Once signed into law, any and all interference with the federal government as voted for by the people would constitute not only a crime but would be considered an act of sedition and war. The Republicans and our President aren’t going to sit idly by while a man who no longer holds office interferes in the governing of our country.Jeff Derpinger, Director of the WHOIP, told Fox News that the bill would go into effect immediately and that Obama’s movements are already being monitored. “The Deep State is finished in America, ” he said, “let him go back to Kenya if he wants to pretend to be in charge.”Once signed, Obama will be under surveillance as long as he’s on American soil. Should he decide to leave the country and continue trying to have an influence over our laws, he could be charged with espionage and have his citizenship revoked.Finally someone has decided to do something about the traitor.








The Russian government contacted the Trump administration just moments ago to inform them that the bombing in St. Petersburg this morning has been traced not to radical Islamic terrorists but to an operative inside the Obama Deep State shadow government.Obama’s plan was fairly simple. By making it look like ISIS has reached all the way to the interior of Russia, maybe Putin would pull out of Syria to take care of his own people, leaving US forces vulnerable to attack from his friends in the Muslim Brotherhood. Without Putin to intervene and with their knowledge of American tactics, Deep State would be able to make it seem that Trump is losing control.It’s all a part of the Obama plan to destabilize the trump administration and make it seem weak. The Russians are certain they’ve figured out the whole plot. A small cell of Muslims were infiltrated and made to believe they were taking instructions from ISIS. They were provided with intel and materials to bomb the station in Russia. That intel and the bomb came from the Obama shadow government, working out of turkey, under direct orders from none other than John Kerry.Putin has given the Trump administration an ultimatum to either admit the insurrection and turn Kerry over for prosecution or risk destabilizing our relationship with a world superpower.What would the liberals say? Oh, yeah. Thanks, Obama.








The Justice Department is reporting that they have enough evidence of tax evasion to not only take everything the Obamas own but to also garnish the money they’re making from their new book deals. The scandal, which is tied to illegal royalties Michelle was paid by the friend from college she hired to design the Obamacare website, is said to have netted the former first family nearly a billion dollars.A spokesman from Jeff Sessions’ office told Fox News:“We knew when we heard about the Obamacare scam that there would be issues. When we saw that it was worth over $900 million, we were thrown back a little. Hopefully they won’t get away with it.”Hopefully? If they get away with a billion dollars in taxpayer money they shoud be taken to Gitmo forever.President Trump has vowed to see that the Obamas lose their assets, their library and their book deal money as well as their credibility. He wants to make sure that nobody named Obama ever holds public office again.








Traitorous Muslim Barack Obama just threw a little hissy fit in public after the Secret Service refused to remove all of the people in line if front of him at a smoothie shop in Arlington, Virginia. Late for a tee time and in need of his kiwi lime fix, Obama displayed that he is nothing but a toddler with a security detail.A woman who was standing in line told the Washington Examiner:“He was like a little kid. He stomped around demanding we all get out of his way. Then he made his goons take the cell phones from the people who were recording, got his smoothie and left.”The “legacy” that is Barack Obama and his failed life continues.








After learning everything possible from Vince Foster’s exhumed body before it was stolen and burned, investigators gave the OK to have him reinterred. On inspection of the grave, it was discovered that the exhumation crew had cracked the concrete vault that held Foster’s casket, requiring it to be replaced.When they took the old vault out, they made a horrible discovery. A body, wrapped in an old tarp, had been buried underneath Foster’s vault. The body was removed and sent to the Naval Hospital in Norfolk where it was identified as Margaret Sanguay, a young woman thought to have run away from home in 1994.Sanguay, as it turns out, worked as a White House intern from 1993 until her disappearance. She left a handwritten note behind in her Arlington, Virginia apartment stating that she was eloping with her boyfriend and that the couple would be spending the next decade backpacking through Caledonia. He wasn’t in the grave with her and has been listed with the FBI as a missing person.How did an intern during the Clinton administration end up dead and buried under Vince Foster’s vault? Gee…that’s a tough one.








Well, Obama is making sure his War on Christmas lasts clear through his last days in the White House. Early Monday morning, Barack Hussein Obama signed an executive order banning the use of a baby Jesus on the White House soil. That’s right, he banned Jesus Christ.He told MSNBC:I am signing this order as an act of tolerance and peace towards globalized unity. Symbols like the nativity or a manger are divisive during a holiday season shared by many different walks of faith. Our White House in inclusive to them all. To make others feel welcome, we will no longer have Jesus in the manger on White House grounds.Umm, everyone knows America is a Christian nation. How can you have Christmas with no Baby Jesus? This comes after Obama decided Christmas Trees were banned from the White House and declared them all Holiday Trees. Ugh!We can rest assured President Trump will reverse this action but, it looks like the White House will have yet another Christ-less Christmas with the anti-Christ in the White House.January 20 can’t come soon enough!








A spokesperson for Melania Trump let the cat out of the bag early Wednesday morning that the future First Lady has decided what her main initiative will be when her husband takes office and Michelle Obama is not going to like it. Speaking under condition of anonymity, the spokesman revealed to CBS News that Mrs. Trump will be restoring the federal school lunch program to something children will actually eat.“One of the things Melania Trump is most troubled by is that children are being served inadequate and unappetizing meals in school in the name of nutrition,” said the aide, “When she learned that the First Lady can help mold school menus into something they look forward to rather than something they despise, she was thrilled.”According to the spokesman, Mrs. Trump isn’t planning on putting fryolators back in school cafeterias or serving Twinkies and cupcakes for lunch, but she does believe that a diet with steady carbs and enticing fruits and vegetables would be more appealing to schoolchildren who have been living for the past eight years with lunches like these: Melania decided to take on the initiative after learning that children who couldn’t stomach the lunches were going hungry and couldn’t even muster enough energy to do anything but sit down during recess. “She believes in children, food and recess. What can I say, she’s a great mom,” her spokesman said, “while her husband fixes Barack Obama’s mess, she’ll make sure history forgets Michelle Obama.”That sounds great. Now how about a refund for all the vacations?Michelle Obama is so distraught over Melania’s move to bring flavor and satisfaction back to school lunches that she cancelled her schedule for the day, presumably to stay in and sulk.








Hillary Clinton, who tried to fool the country into thinking a 70-year-old woman could possibly be fit to be President of the United States, collapsed outside her daughter Chelsea’s New York apartment yesterday, prompting an emergency visit to her doctor. After some initial tests, the doctor admitted her to Mount Sinai Hospital where she will spend the better part of the next week undergoing tests.A spokesman for the hospital told The New York Post:“Secretary Clinton suffers from post-election anxiety that borders on PTSD along with what appears to be a chronic neurological disorder that makes her physically able to do more than most people think she’s actually capable of. It could be a real problem for someone of her advanced years.”It appears as though Clinton, whose bout with pneumonia almost left her passed out on a New York sidewalk on 9/11, will have to cancel her campaign for 2020 if she had one in mind in lieu of some time on the shuffleboard court at a\n assisted living facility.We’d like to have some empathy for this woman but after sending and receiving all of those emails and being in charge when an embassy was attacked, it’s just not in the cards. Maybe this is just a clear-cut case of karma.








Robert DeNiro has become a well-known loser ever since his cute little “Trump is a punk” video made no difference on election day. In that video, he told some very bad lies and disrespected the president in a big way. Watch the piece of trash fake tough guy’s pitiful performance below:Now that President Trump has taken office, DeNiro went on a list of people who had directly threatened hi. “I’d like to punch him in the face” might be something fun to say about a guy at the end of the bar or your wife’s flirty boss, but it’s not something you can just say about the President of the United States. Donald Trump made sure of that when he signed the POTUS protection order the day he took office.Jeff Derpinger, Director of the WHOIP, told reporters from The Gateway Pundit and Breitbart:“President Trump said from the beginning that he wouldn’t stand for the insults and threats and that they’d be dealt with accordingly. DeNiro is an influential person in this country and his statements create a direct and credible threat against the leader of our country. As such, he will be investigated, his passport and any travel visas he has revoked and he will go on the no-fly list. He will also be subject to a tax audit and further investigation by the Justice Department. Basically, his entire life is about to be opened and examined.Let this be a lesson to those who won’t back President Trump: You will not like what happens if you don’t fall in line.”DeNiro wasn’t available for comment but a source for Paramount Pictures says the travel ban has already cost him more than $10 million for contracted filming obligations in New Zealand that he can no longer attend.Take notice, liberals. You can’t just say whatever you want about President Trump and get away with it.








Five peaceful, tolerant liberals (ha ha) were just pulled from the crowd outside the capitol and charged with conspiracy to commit murder and domestic terrorism after Secret Service agents identified them as a left-wing terror cell responsible for riots in New York and Philadelphia after election day. Information streaming out of Washington says all five are American born citizens.There is very little to go on so far, but Special Agent Zach Braniff told reporters that the killers were serious about their mission and were ready to bring the entire Capitol building down to accomplish their mission:“They all had suicide vests on and their minivan was found to contain enough explosives to take out a large chunk of Capitol Hill. They were chanting about freedom of speech and choice, which clearly means they have been influenced by fake news and have zero respect for human life.”The terrorists were whisked away for questioning at an undisclosed location and the area was cleared for the President’s speech this evening. This is a developing story the mainstream media isn’t talking about but we will certainly keep you updated as things develop.








Late last week, a rumor began circulating in Washington social circles that there was trouble in paradise for Barack and Michelle Obama. While there was no confirmation, it was being tossed around that it was Barack looking to dump Michelle. This morning, a filing in the District Court of Cook County, Illinois confirmed that the couple is seeking divorce and that Barack is, in fact, the plaintiff.According to county docket D4610968L86, Barack Hussein Obama seeks dissolution of marriage from Michelle Obama on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable differences. The infidelity, according to the Obama’s longtime housekeeper, Analita Consuelo Gonsales, isn’t recent but rather the revelation through a recent DNA test that Obama isn’t the biological father of Sasha or Malia.Gonsales said that it wasn’t really a surprise, because during an argument in 2003 Barack admitted to Michelle that he had faked all of his orgasms. Michelle, in turn, admitted that she had an affair with a biolab and that the children were actually the product of advanced genetic engineering. Apparently, Malia is secretly one of the most talented dulcimer musicians in the world and Sasha’s IQ is so high she’s a single lab accident away from being a supervillain and taking over the world.Obama, who suddenly feels like an outcast in a family of such amazing people, will step aside and even back Michelle’s 2020 run for president, but he will not agree to paying any form of support for Sasha, who is still a minor, mostly because she makes more money playing Texas Hold ’em in a month than he makes in a year.It’s lucky for us that we don’t have to have this kind of craziness in our White House anymore. Having a great, stable family like the Trumps is doing wonders for America.








The libtards of America just love to pretend they aren’t sexist, even though they support putting the wife of a serial rapist, sexual harasser and Oval Office defiler back in the White House. So let’s see what they have to say about this secretly recorded video showing Bill Clinton wishing his wife would just stay home and make him a sandwich.In the recorded by a caterer, Bill Clinton is seen talking to an unknown man who has his back to the camera. The two are deep in conversation about golf, and retired life when Bill says something shocking:“It’s nice for Hillary to be running for president, but sometimes I just wish she would stay home and make me a damn sandwich!”The unknown man chuckles and says, “They sure don’t make women like they used to.”Bill laughs and says:“I get so jealous of these Republican guys, their wives smell like cookies and are always smiling and polite.”Someone steps in front of the camera for several minutes and blocks the conversation, but when the video picks back up Bill and the man are seen clinking their glasses together and though the video is almost inaudible it sounds like Bill says:“–if she loses–I can get my man card back!”The two then slap each other on the back.Back in the 90s Hillary Clinton insulted women across America when she said:“I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.”Seems kind of like that’s exactly the kind of woman Bill wished he had judging by this new video. Probably why he’s had multiple affairs throughout his marriage.After Hillary Clinton loses the election, Slick Willy might be drowning in sandwiches.UPDATE This video was removed from YouTube shortly after publishing. Obviously, the Clintons will go to any length to silence this video.








What do Vladimir Putin’s dog and Barack Obama have in common? The same name!According to sources close to the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin sat down with Germany’s Angela Merkel to give her some advice on how to handle the influx of radical islamic terrorists who are flooding into Germany. As a token of appreciation, Merkel gave Putin a black Labrador Retriever. Putin then immediately stood up and announced to the reporters in the room that the dog will be named after the President of the United States.“This animal will be named Barack Hussein Obama!”Merkel then mocked Obama by pretending to be afraid of the large black animal, waving her hands in the air and silent screaming.While it is hilarious that a man’s man like Putin just insulted Barack Obama, it’s also an insult to every American Patriot. Remember the days when we were respected and even feared by the world? Now strong world leaders mock ours.If you didn’t already think Obama has made our country the laughingstock of the world, a strong ruler like Putin naming his dog after the U.S. President proves it.We need a strong man heading America, again. A leader that foreign leaders would fear naming their dogs after. We need a man like Donald Trump in the White House who wouldn’t stand for being disrespected by having a dignitaries’ Golden Retriever named after him. Of course, Putin knows Trump wouldn’t put up with this crap, so he wouldn’t even try it.Obama was unable to be reached for comment, as reported from several journalists who were in the room during Putin’s announcement. He was probably playing golf or campaigning for Killary.Make American Great Again!








After a campaign appearance for Hillary Clinton in Las Vegas Friday Night, President Obama had to receive emergency medical treatment from the surgeon assigned to Air Force One after he tripped and fell and busted his face open. A source in the President’s press corps witnessed the event, which has been played off as “a minor scrape,” saying that there was a fair amount of blood and almost certainly a couple of stitches.The best part of the story is how the whole ordeal took place. According to the source, an intern with a major publication, Obama was walking through the staff kitchen in the plane looking for something salty to snack on when he slipped on a pocket copy of the United States Constitution somebody must have dropped, causing him to whack his chin off of one of the stainless steel prep tables.When one of the chefs joked that he must not have seen it, Obama was heard to say, “I’ve never seen one of those before in my life.” As the crew yucked it up and joked, America continued its suffering outside of the luxury plane as 92 million people were still left out of the workforce staring at a $20 trillion debt their grandchildren’s children will be stuck paying for.The mainstream media has been silent about the incident and the doctor did a nice job of concealing the wound. While you may not see it, you can rest easy that at least for a week or so it will Obama when he opens his mouth to speak just as much as it hurts us.








George Soros, the billionaire activist who funds all of the liberal trolls on social media and pays for the anti-Trump demonstrations that turn into riots, has been killed in a small engine plane crash while visiting his home country of Hungaria. His plane went down somewhere in the Alps and hasn’t been recovered, but satellite images confirm that there’s nothing left but rubble.The Democrats and Soros’ people still haven’t confirmed the crash, but the word came from the tower that was guiding the plane in for a landing that it was his. There has been no radio contact with anyone near the crash site.The loss of George Soros will eliminate more than 20 percent of the funding Democrats count on for their elections.








Lady Gaga, the 5 foot 2, 98-pound ball of rage who got away with throwing something at Melania Trump just before the election, might not get off so easily this time after she went into a fit of anger and trashed the lobby of the Novotel Hotel in downtown Ottowa. Gaga, who isn’t known for her restraint, was reportedly on edge and looking for a fight, exploding when another hotel guest mentioned that she must be unhappy with Donald Trump’s victory.According to CTV Ottowa, Gaga was like a caged animal taking out her aggression on her captors as she flipped over tables, broke flower vases, tore pictures from the walls and dumped Diet Mountain Dew all over a concierge desk. Serg  Plimtweather, a bellboy at the esteemed hotel, said:“It was rather odd, you know? Such a tiny little thing. She sure does pack a mean little punch, though, eh?”Yes, that was the funniest line we could find about this entire story. Because she has already offered to pay for the damages and didn’t actually assault anyone physically, T RCMP decided not to arrest her, but she could still face charges from the Canadian government that could end with a lifetime ban from visiting the country.Can we get her to trash a hotel here, too?








Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov is a Russian government operative who admits to having contact with people in America during the last presidential election cycle. Lavrov says that going back as far as 2014, he had an informant inside the United States that discussed matters of national security for both countries, including the invasion of Crimea in Ukraine and the hacking of the DNC in the United States.Lavrov’s contact, however, was not from inside the Trump campaign or even the Clinton campaign, his name is John Tefft and he worked for the Obama State Department. Tefft is said to have had lengthy conversations with Lavrov and many of his aides and even spent time during summits in face-to-face meetings with him.Democrats are screaming about Richard Flynn and Paul Manafort and the possibility that President Trump may have colluded with the Russians when in reality the largest breach of our government came from the Obama administration. Trey Gowdy has announced that there will be investigations into this matter:“The left has been throwing Donald Trump’s senior staff under the bus for giving the Russians information they could use to blackmail them, which isn’t something we’re ready to look into until it’s actually deemed harmful to our way of life. So far nothing has come of it.What we won’t stand for is this 2 year relationship between this Tefft guy and a Russian operative named Lavrov that was so casual it happened on our own diplomatic soil, right under the nose of a sitting president.”This is just another example of how the Democrats will deflect blame for their own problems — usually caused by Obama — and blame President Trump every time.








During Friday Night’s Hillary Clinton rally in Ohio, Beyonce’ Knowles, known for her liberal ideals and anti-police rhetoric, was performing a free set for the murderous email queen when she suddenly stopped singing. She turned towards the side of the stage where Hillary was standing and said, “You’re in my earpiece.”Clinton, looking surprised, gave a smile and started clapping. Beyonce’ continued her performance but cut it short after just two songs. She was seen storming off stage and leaving the venue in a limousine shortly thereafter.Wikileaks Gives Hillary An Ultimatum: QUIT, Or We Dump Something Life-DestroyingA reporter from the local Parma Gazette asked around and found out from a sound tech that Clinton’s lapel mic was hot and all of the staff were listening when she said:“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”The Clinton campaign refused calls for comment and the roadie who gave the original report is now nowhere to be found. Hopefully his life insurance was up to date.It Was Demorats who started the KKK and they never left it. Time for black people to know you have used for over 50 years and you follow like sheepiesThat’s what Beyoncé gets!!!! LMAO  sorry not sorry for loving this!
And Killary can’t even be happy to get a free concert without being so

Not exactly free!Nothing matters to HRC except HRCLMAO!Actually hitlery paid them 62mil for the “free” concertIs it rude or did Beyonce deserve it like you imply? Can you make up your mind and whatnot or is this Tourettes?That concert wasn’t free. Campaign funds paid them $65,000,000 to jay z and BeyoncéHillary paid Beyon`ce and her husband $62 million to do this concert….it was not for free!!!http://endingthefed.com/clinton-campaign-paid-beyonce-and-jay-z-62-million-for-cleveland-concert-to-secure-black-votes.htmllmao it wasnt free she paid out 65 mil for that last sec concertThe best think that Beyonce can do is to vote for  Trump and let her know it.That will  make her even madder.LMAO….good enough for both of themI want to understand, why did Black Americans stand at attention, while Obama was talking down to them, as if they were part of a Chain Gang, taking orders from their prison guards? I thought people have freedom of choice, not someone elses ideology. Wake up Black America, the Democrats are playing you for your votes. The could give a crap less about your struggles or difficulties.What black people as if you know all black people, as if you know what all black people think or feel. You don’t know that…. Stop with the assumption. We ate not one mind.Hillary’s use of Jay-Z and other entertainers in a feeble attempt of pandering the minority vote demonstrates her / liberals thoughts regarding minority people of the nation.
If you don’t understand this, Think;
Why can’t she bring to you a message of intellectual value with no question in her mind you’ll understand?
She banks on her thoughts of your ignorance to further her agenda.
Non minority supporters of Hillary should be considered racist pigs for condoning her strategies…not sure what you mean?~ well… ur black ass is DEF. one minded, cuz you can not even fkn spell right…(Lol)  All Hail BLM… B*lack  L*azy  M*onkeys….(LMMF*W*AO)Hey Rev.

Wonder what she says about them when they are not around?Because they are involved in the Illuminati also.The Hollywood set follows Hillary because they live in the same elitist world Hillsry does.  They are completely out of touch with the reality we live in. They are blind to the hypocrisy and corruption in the Democratic Party because it doesn’t touch them.Exactly!idk why she would think she is any different than all the others they use and then toss aside like yesterdays garbage…smdh….i thought she was supposed to be so dam smart….HA….guess that was a lie tooTheir Sheeple, and Killary was probably loaded again!!!Their sheeple? Whose sheeple? Trump or Hillary?Money… They’re paid!Hollywood is owned by Zionists. Just like Hillary.I am a Zionist and I am for Trump!!!I don’t think you understand the term zionist.   “a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel. It was established as a political organization in 1897 under Theodor Herzl, and was later led by Chaim Weizmann.”Hillary Clinton is definitely NOT in favor of the Jewish nation prospering in their own land no matter what drivel comes out of her mouth.You are full of crap.  She is owned by Soros who hates Israel and Zionists!!!
Get educated!Seriously, get your facts straight, before sending it all out into the population
. The Devil aka, Illuminati,  owns alot of the souls of Actors. Musicians and such.. they sell their souls to the Evil doers and then the become actors , musicians etc. Makes me sick… Obama had a bunch of them to the white house just recently and gave them medals of some sort,  check it out , Obama , Clinton’s,  Soros and some top politicians  in power are all part of this Sick Society of Satan worshippers and child molesters….They are hoping for favors or the ability to rent a night in the Lincoln Bedroom!Because like her, most of those in Hollywood HAVE NO MORALS!When will people learn that the Clintons’ are nothing but users?

Wake up folks and vote Trump.is there video of this?Can’t seem to find one. Which song was it?I hope this is true. Would love to watch the libtardian left  tearing themselves apart…..And this is to prove what? There is no audio or video evidence to corroborate the story. Just a right wing “reporter” (and I use that term loosely)  with a fantastical story idea which isn’t original. Simply took what happened with Trump and his hot mic (whice had evidence) and trying to turn it on Clinton. This isn’t news. It’s fallacy, and not done well at all. Lazy reporting.You’re one of those idiots, believe everything they say about Trump but all the dirt on Hillary is just right-wing blather and lies. I’ll hit you up next time I need to count sheep.HAHAHAAnd what evidence do you have that it’s false? Beyonce did stop in the song and Beyonce did take after only two songs without further adieu. So you don’t believe this story but rather have Hillary make a fool out of youDo you know all or just can’t stand the truth? Wise up , Clinton is a user , she got caught , it’s not the first time.But it’s like something she would say!!Daniel, maybe its time to pull your head out of your ass!Beyonce, tell me she did not!  I don’t put nothing pass
 the Really Rottens!!!! sorry mf’s!I see any (polite) dissenting comment gets held for moderation then deleted. How liberal of you.Just hadn’t been moderated yet. We have a small team.Really? Because I’ve read several already.Sorry this is b.s. I watched the show and nobody stormed off stage Beyonce was hugging Hilary and handed her the mic before kissing her and calmy walked off stage with her husband. It’s amazing the roadie couldn’t be found after his bogus claim!That’s what i saw on the video…I’d be glad for someone to provide video evidence to the contrary!!She hasn’t learned to keep her big mouth shut yet.But Beyoncé still preformed her services for the racist murderer without defending her music or her people didn’t she.For once Hillary was being truthful! Why was the pole dancer even there?Well that’s one time she didn’t lieHaha. So true!she and her subservient  ilk always been  slaves for fat*ss clinton and that ain’t gonna change.She uses Ppl. like no one else !.She hates Minorities until election day !In the Beyonce story, don’t mean to be picky but correct spelling is WHOAWell it surely is crap pseudo music.There ya go!  Just goes to show you Beyonce that you are just another Negro to her even if you sold your soul to the devilI doubt it is true.Done you twos heard it and was you two sittin to gether?How many times does this have to happen before they realize the ruthless person they are bowing and scraping too..about time they find out.So damn funny and fitting! Maybe now these”artists”and I use the term loosely,will finally realize what a piece of scum Hillery is.I can’t stand Hillary, but let’s not be like her and the Dem’s media, I want to hear her own voice saying these things. any person of reasonable intelligence in either party, should want to see & hear real proof of wrong doing.AgreeWow what a ungrateful witch !! There is something wrong with her, she is fake as hell.MAYBE PEOPLE WILL START REALIZING HILLARY DOESN’T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THEM….IT’S ALL FOR HER POLITICAL GAIN AND SHE WILL SAY AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES!!!  WE CANNOT HAVE HER IN THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN!!!!The Clintons have,always been for themselves. All the money in the Clinton Foundation  was put there by donors,TO the Clintons for a “charityfoundation” ..which turns out the money from the Foundation is used as their personal “bank account” to use the money for their own family…Busted as the hypocritical, pathological-psychotic thief and traitor she is.THAT WAS THE REAL HILLARY,THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS BEEN KIDDING IT’S SELF FOR DECADES THINKING THE DEMOCRATS WERE WITH THEM , FOR THEM. DEMOCRATS ARE WHAT BLACKS SHOULD CALL THE ANTI-AMERICAN RACIST PARTY. THE D.N.C. HAS HAD A HATETRED FOR BLACKS FOR 150 YRS AND WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THEM UNDER THEIR THUMP AND DOWN ON THE PLANTATION. IT’S TIME FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO PULL THEIR COLLECTIVE HEADS OUT OF THE SAND AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE REAL DEMOCRATS, ‘CAUSE IF THEY DON’T THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT #’S WILL EXPLODE  AND POVERTY WILL EXPLODE….THAT’S DEMOCRAT BIG GOVERNMENT CONTROL. CLINTON IS BIG GOVERNMENT ,IS AN ELITIST,IS A RACIST,AND DID TAKE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FROM THEIR BABY THE K.K.K. FREEDOM FROM DEMOCTAT CONTROL IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP.Pop diesel..agree with your post 100%!!  Ok if we borrow it and share??So Jay Z and Beyonce conduct a FREE concert for Hillary Clinton.. Hum.. Yet Donald Trump stands alone with JUST his 15,000 supporters, who came for JUST Trump.. no help form the so called “star power”!! And let’s not forget his republican party.. Talk about weak!!
I personally find it very insulting that Hillary Clinton thinks so low of the black community, she plays them for a fool and thinks they are down right stupid! I hope you all enjoyed the FREE concert she supplied you with. Because that ALL she will do for you!
Think about this, Hillary Clinton thinks that the only way black people will ever understand the election process and the fact that they should even vote, period…is to use the words FREE and WELFARE. Hillary has purposely bound a large percentage of the black community in a vice, locked them down and they are under her sick control!
GET OUT AND VOTE PEOPLE!! DON’T BELIEVE THE SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN THEY SAY “THERE IS NO WAY FOR TRUMP TO WIN, HE HAS A NARROW PATH” it’s all mind control.. they want us to feel there is no point to go out and vote if SHE is going to win anyway!! GO OUT AND VOTE!!! Bring your family and friends, tell your coworkers to through their kids in the mini van and get to the polls!!
Beyonce.. put that fist up.. you know, the one you display so proudly in honor for the black panthers.. and punch yourself right in the mouth with it!
Whoever your voting for just GO VOTE!!I agree, Missy.  Free stuff.  I saw a clip from the show and Hillary was yet again offensive after JZ and his crew did a horrific, violent rap that called women bitches and hoes and talk about drugs and killin niggas – oh yes, and hoes.  She was euphoric as she clapped at the end shouting happily, “THIS IS YOU, AMERICA!  THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT!” All the people clapped and shouted approval.  Really people?  She likes to pander to black people with a tremendous disconnect.  She actually believes black people are all gangsta… and ignorant.
Meanwhile, Trump STILL had more people at his rallies without free food and free concert tickets.  I hope those people had a good time and then vote trump anyway.Even Left lib’d can’t say it’s ok for what Hillary did! Truthful who the hell want a EVIL👺LYING MURERING WITCH I’ll NEVER FORGET BENGHAZI!She is always flapping her yap! Why more people haven’t caught on is beyond me?  I find it rather amusing, how stupid her minions truly are…Why there isn’t more truth from HRC’s *#@&^%! garbage gutter mouth???  It’s because HilLiarY does not allow anyone in her presence to have a cell phone.http://www.mediazone.news/index.php/2016/11/04/every-american-will-

hillary-clinton-on-pedophilia-and-treason-charges/#comment-1385Let’s get on with it!Clinton doesn’t even know how NOT to bite a gift horse in the mouth!! What a stupid, arrogant, hateful person – couldn’t she have just enjoyed the show?The real Hillary just opened her racist bigoted mouth. Go figure!Ooops, the only time Hillary doesn’t lie is when she thinks no one is listening.Go 4 it .Hillary will bust it wide openThey deserved each other .You and your man are always welcome on the Trump train!!!! We one big happy family!! No we are not racist!!Hillary is smarter than B…and Z….But not T…Trump….the blacks have heard Hillary say racist things …they are stupid FOR supporting her.Where is the video showing this. .. young voters don’t realize that she is a Grand Puba Princess  the KKK. . Her mentor was bird. They Democratic Party has been the one for over a hundred years keeping people enslaved and that’s what your welfare is.House keeper printing classified emails and Clinton has good judgement.! Go figure.Does this surprise anyone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well it is ghetto directed trash music.  Clinton knows how to fuk things up. LolHILLARY IS SO UGLY AND  SHE WOULD NOT BE THE PRESIDENT THAT WE NEED.thank you..I would love to be the Hangman for Her and Bill Clinton!LOL how stupid..she gets bustedas always, killary will get a free pass.
liberals are nothing if not unified. they hate each other behind closed doors, but they march in lockstep to vote.This is proof I’ll be voting Green Party!!
The LORD is in control!!I don’t care for Beyonce or her music but have enough class to never say something like that whether anyone could hear me or not!Hillary is a failure even at her own eventsShe is just as racist as Beyonce.Oh God, her private persona has been leaked again.  I hate when that happens.  She just messed with the Queen B.DON’T TURN YOUR BACK ON HILLARHOID, SHE’LL CUT YOUR THROAT, OR STOP PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN HER POCKET SHE’LL TAKE YOU DOWN SOME WAY.Gotta love it!She is a hypocrite right along with Michelle Obama. They are offended by the People’s Choice for President Donald Trump’s locker room word Pussy and yet Tom Jones sings it: What’s New Pussy Cat and then they use Beyonce foul mouth and F words and N words to get people to go and vote for her. She even has Obama committing criminal act telling illegals to vote and they won’t get in trouble…that is a felony also. And she uses the Democrats foundation of KKK against Donald when they are using black lives matter group to cause disturbances at our rallies and that black singer using the F and N for every other word during a concert for Hillary herself. She is a hypocrite.She is such a lovely grant mother type person, trash although I am not a fan of Beyoncé either, but I certainly not kiss her backside then trash her! But the kindly lady (NOT) who wants to be our president has no such qualms! She is trash a traitor, liar, thief and many things America does not know about yet!well..believe it or not, that was not racist….I don’t like that music either..torture to have to sit and listen to it…the ONLY thing I agree with hillary onIs that why JayZ thug hit someone as he was leaving?What is so surprising about this?  Just another one of her “hate tactics” to use and abuse for her so called gain.  Minorities wake up!!  Do you really trust a Jezabel like Hillary!Beyonce and Hillary are some of the most racist people I’ve ever seen.. they both deserve each other and I would rather clean a bathroom with a toothbrush than to support either one of them… we do not need her or any of her blackliesmatter clan….We’ve been trying to tell people for months that Hillary hates America!  ALL Americans!  Beyonce, that goes for you, too.  She is an elitist of the worse kind that goes miles beyond racist or bigot.  You should vote Trump.why is beyonce so shocked I thought all trash stuck together, beyonce is just as bad as Hillary so it like the pot calling the kettle black or in this case negro!Corrections: *to not say and do these things*I think this is funny as hell…oh well she gets a  taste the fruits of Hilary Clinton lap it up baby girl aren’t you proud to support such a wonderful women✌No surprise….except to Beyonce.  Maybe now she will understand who Hillary really is behind her lies.  Not a nice woman and she’s only looking for votes.I doubt this story is true. I do however feel that Killary has just been using everyone, especially Black people in this country to get what she wants most in life. I have never felt that her concern for the plight of Black Americans is real. She moved to Harlem to try to prove to them that she accepts them, but it was just a move to become a Senator from NY. I’ll give it to her for keeping to her strategy.  If her record alone isn’t enough to convince people that she and Bill are just two crooks using the system, there’s nothing anyone can say that will change their mind. Barack Obama said it during the race against her,”Hillary Clinton is a liar, a crook, and has never done anything that she’s promised.”  He further stated that she isn’t fit to be president. I truly feel bad for those who are so geared toward their party that they will let Lucifer in the door.When are people going to “get it”? HILLARY CLINTON IS TRASH!!!No one likes the bitch Beyonce so truth is, Hillary gained thousands of votes…This is a clip from the show.Lol Beyonce.. Who cares? She is ghetto trash… Lmfao what did you expect Beyonce? You side with a liar, you get played..Who knows if this is true or not. I’m just surprised that JZ, ( Who seems to be an intelligent man) what allow himself and his wife to be used at the Democratic Party.Hillary Has bleeding hemroids! Cut her some slack… Bleeding hemroids is no laughing matter! If I knew, of a quick remedy, I would put my finger right on it… that would prepare her to be Potis.PLEASE NO MORE CLINTON CARTEL!  THEY WILL DESTROY THE USA AND LEAVE WITH EVEN MORE MONEY. SHES A LYING MURDERING THIEF.As an American citizen I recognize that the 2nd amendment is important but there is one that is greater, the 1st amendment.  By posting this I am expressing my 1st amendment right.  I hope you will be willing to allow me to express my views freely.  Otherwise you are doing exactly what you claim the government is doing. I have removed anything personally offensive to other  readers therefore I don’t see why you wouldn’t allow it.  Thanks in advance.To all the people on the Trump bandwagon, I have this message for you….wake up and use your brain! All of you spewing hatred over a false story. This is ridiculous. Donald Trump has been playing each and every one of you from the very beginning. Feeding off of your fears in order to win your votes. You are the sheep and he the master manipulator. This man can say absolutely anything and still you believe him. As a matter of fact he HAS said just about any and everything and you have believed him. Just like this story he has been caught in several lies throughout this campaign. It’s like he says whatever he feels is going to sway the most people his way regardless of the truth behind it. He changes his stance and position on topics as the wind blows and you blow right along with it. He rants on social media like an immature toddler and has no self-control at 70 years old!! Yes, he has built a real estate empire but that doesn’t mean he can lead this country. Those are two very different things. He is a character, a TV personality whose ego is so big that he wants to be the most powerful man in the world. He doesn’t have what it takes to lead the country. How foolish are all of you for allowing yourselves to fall for this circus? How do you elect a president that is ignorant regarding foreign policy? How as a woman can you elect a president that has no respect for you or your gender and has proven it time and time again? How as a minority (for the few that plan on voting for him) do you back someone who has no regard for you or your race? It’s not about being PC or sensitive to harsh words and rhetoric.  Listen to what he says.  He has told you exactly who and what he is….so believe him.  As a presidential candidate the man has zero substance. His entire campaign is built on tearing others down, spreading fear, and sheer negativity. He doesn’t have real plans for this country. The campaign slogan he uses “Make America Great Again” was stolen from Ronald Reagan. He is taking your most revered Republican figure and using it to his advantage.  He speaks very vaguely, constantly promising that he is going to fix this or that but never saying how. You are fed up with government but yet are willing to elect someone who is doing the same thing you claim politicians do.  You know why he can’t see how he’ll fix it?…because he doesn’t know how and doesn’t plan to. He just wants to be the most powerful man on the planet…that’s his end game and you are so foolishly his puppets helping him complete his goal. Whether conscious or subconscious, many of you are so blinded by your hatred for OUR president (who happens to be black) that you are willing to vote for the most unqualified candidate probably ever.  Like a cunning fox, he strategically changed his viewpoints on several key issues to align himself with the Republican party because it was his best chance of being nominated…AND IT WORKED!!! He’s probably the first non-Republican to be nominated by the Republican party. My fellow Americans what you are doing is an absolute disgrace and it is extremely sad that you have let him get this far and may get him all the way to the White House. You have been manipulated. You have been lied to. You have been hoodwinked and you have been bamboozled. You cherish your 2nd amendment right to bear arms over everything else and have allowed a con artist to take complete advantage of that. Trump won’t “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”. He can’t. He knows there’s no greater America than the present version and is trying to take full advantage. Not convinced, well in what other time could a sleazy, racist, tax-evading, TV personality, with tons of money, no moral compass, and fake Christian values become President of the United States?  None.  Someone who has no government experience, little to no understanding of foreign policy, and no regard for the people of this country? There has never been another time.  No time like the present fellow citizens which is why if Trump is elected president America will never be great again but by the time you realize that it will be too late. Congratulations, by attempting to “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”, you may have permanently ruined it for our children and for future generations.  Thanks a bunch.Before you get your panties in a wad, I do not mean for this post to sound as though I dislike America. It is a beautiful place with wonderful people.I am trying to figure out how to get away from the amount of control the government has on my life. Sad part is…There isn’t one….hear me out. I have to have money to do all of the things I need to live because somehow we got tricked into believing these papers and coins are powerful. And even if I bought land and did the homestead thing, I still have to pay taxes, but why? And to whom? And what do they do with the money I am paying them? It seems to me, like I’m making a bunch of crazy people rich while I’m left here wondering where I went wrong in life. (I’ll tell you, nowhere . I’m pretty great okay, some not nice things in my past, but this isn’t about that and I was young.)It seems to me like they just keep saying things like, no you don’t need wells anymore drink city water, and a lot of people do. And then they put fluoride in our water! (I won’t even go into the crisis of the Flint, Michigan water, that is still needing repaired, right? Or the recent pipeline problem.) And instead of trying to use cheaper more efficient fuel they continue to build pipelines through our lands that will poison our natural water sources. Not to mention the other tremendous issues ecologically which will result from not finding new ways.While we let them do it to us!But why? If we buy something from somewhere is it not ours? Then who are they to tell us what we can do on the land that we bought from them?! And why do we pay taxes for them to tell us what to do on property we bought from them?!I had a lot more but I lost where I was going, I’m so infuriated and astonished at what is happening all around me. Not just in America, but the world. (and beyond 👻👽)I’m telling you all if we don’t start to unite they will kill us all. More of us can be born and bred until they figure out how to get robots to be their minions.…..they keep telling me that I am free…….but they tell me what I can put in my body……..they tell me that I  am free… but THEY put stuff in MY body I would not and somehow that is okay…they tell me that I am free…..and they force me to pay for something that was not affordable in the first place, but they can give me a number where if I meet poverty level I won’t be forced to pay the fine for not buying the insurance I already could not afford….they tell me that I am free and they will give me everything I need while making it impossible to access or find out any information on anything…they tell me I am free.#WecanbefreeI don’t get a sound bite on this site; however, it was reported (and disputed on several websites) that Killary said: “I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”Is there any hope for our nation with all the liberal cool-aid drinking people hooked on Hillary’s liesREMEMBER, when you vote today, Hillary, the DNC, the Washington & Hollywood Elites, the Media AND the Obama Administration are COUNTING ON your POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, your INDIFFERENCE, AND your IGNORANCE of their CRIMES, MANIPULATIONS AND LIES!!!   It’s TIME for WE THE PEOPLE to TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK!!!!“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”  I guess Hillary may have some normal traits.STOP all this hate and learn to love each other, if you don’t like what others say take them out of your life, don’t fill it with hate, if there more love in this world this will make it better for everyone, colour is skin deep, under that, we are all the same, our flesh is red with blood, if yours is different then you came from another planet. Give a strange a hug and be kind to each other.Do black people just believe any bs?








During Friday Night’s Hillary Clinton rally in Ohio, Beyonce’ Knowles, known for her liberal ideals and anti-police rhetoric, was performing a free set for the murderous email queen when she suddenly stopped singing. She turned towards the side of the stage where Hillary was standing and said, “You’re in my earpiece.”Clinton, looking surprised, gave a smile and started clapping. Beyonce’ continued her performance but cut it short after just two songs. She was seen storming off stage and leaving the venue in a limousine shortly thereafter.Wikileaks Gives Hillary An Ultimatum: QUIT, Or We Dump Something Life-DestroyingA reporter from the local Parma Gazette asked around and found out from a sound tech that Clinton’s lapel mic was hot and all of the staff were listening when she said:“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”The Clinton campaign refused calls for comment and the roadie who gave the original report is now nowhere to be found. Hopefully his life insurance was up to date.It Was Demorats who started the KKK and they never left it. Time for black people to know you have used for over 50 years and you follow like sheepiesThat’s what Beyoncé gets!!!! LMAO  sorry not sorry for loving this!
And Killary can’t even be happy to get a free concert without being so
rude, I thought she needed the black vote? Guess BL don’t M to HRC!!!Paid them $62 million.  Not exactly free!Nothing matters to HRC except HRCLMAO!Actually hitlery paid them 62mil for the “free” concertIs it rude or did Beyonce deserve it like you imply? Can you make up your mind and whatnot or is this Tourettes?That concert wasn’t free. Campaign funds paid them $65,000,000 to jay z and BeyoncéHillary paid Beyon`ce and her husband $62 million to do this concert….it was not for free!!!http://endingthefed.com/clinton-campaign-paid-beyonce-and-jay-z-62-million-for-cleveland-concert-to-secure-black-votes.htmllmao it wasnt free she paid out 65 mil for that last sec concertThe best think that Beyonce can do is to vote for  Trump and let her know it.That will  make her even madder.LMAO….good enough for both of themI want to understand, why did Black Americans stand at attention, while Obama was talking down to them, as if they were part of a Chain Gang, taking orders from their prison guards? I thought people have freedom of choice, not someone elses ideology. Wake up Black America, the Democrats are playing you for your votes. The could give a crap less about your struggles or difficulties.What black people as if you know all black people, as if you know what all black people think or feel. You don’t know that…. Stop with the assumption. We ate not one mind.Hillary’s use of Jay-Z and other entertainers in a feeble attempt of pandering the minority vote demonstrates her / liberals thoughts regarding minority people of the nation.
If you don’t understand this, Think;
Why can’t she bring to you a message of intellectual value with no question in her mind you’ll understand?
She banks on her thoughts of your ignorance to further her agenda.
Non minority supporters of Hillary should be considered racist pigs for condoning her strategies…not sure what you mean?~ well… ur black ass is DEF. one minded, cuz you can not even fkn spell right…(Lol)  All Hail BLM… B*lack  L*azy  M*onkeys….(LMMF*W*AO)Hey Rev. Bill, talk like that is not going to unite this country.  Please, we have to stop the hate.Rev Bill your a jackass. I was a Trump supporter, but I certainly have no animosity toward the black people in our society.“We ate not one mind”  WOW…. LMAOObama is a white liberal anointed ROYALIST CLASS BLACK OVERSEER OF HIS RACE AND IS DOING HIS STEP N FETCH IT DUTIES TO HIS WHITE LIBERAL MASTERS~~~PERIOD!!!The “white liberal masters” are Jews, not white.I believe that roadie has done his last gig. His name was found on 4 ballots this weekhere is a better analysis of Dem/GOP stands on civil rights. phttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/28/republicans-party-of-civil-rightsAbsolutely true.AMEN!First get your history right. The Democrats were “Dixicrats” when they formed the KKK, and they are now YOUR KKK!  Black people were no part of the Dixicrats!  Don’t try to give us your white supremistthe dems and republicans have switched positions through the years their beleifs at that time would have made  the democrats republicans now so in other woulds the philosophy than is the same as the present day repulicans ill believe this when i hear it fro BeyonceOh the Ole switcharoo huh? Lmao! So Strom Thurman was the whole democratic party huh? He was the only democrat to switch parties during that time! Wow big switch huh? SMDHHe beyonce there s time to vote TRUMP!I agree!!Time to makes America great again! Vote for Trump!Don’t be fooled you fool. You and your family was poor then, too.Hilly is nothing but trash! I do not see why the Hollywood set are into her when she just uses them for their money and her gain!
Wonder what she says about them when they are not around?Because they are involved in the Illuminati also.The Hollywood set follows Hillary because they live in the same elitist world Hillsry does.  They are completely out of touch with the reality we live in. They are blind to the hypocrisy and corruption in the Democratic Party because it doesn’t touch them.Exactly!idk why she would think she is any different than all the others they use and then toss aside like yesterdays garbage…smdh….i thought she was supposed to be so dam smart….HA….guess that was a lie tooTheir Sheeple, and Killary was probably loaded again!!!Their sheeple? Whose sheeple? Trump or Hillary?Money… They’re paid!Hollywood is owned by Zionists. Just like Hillary.I am a Zionist and I am for Trump!!!I don’t think you understand the term zionist.   “a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel. It was established as a political organization in 1897 under Theodor Herzl, and was later led by Chaim Weizmann.”Hillary Clinton is definitely NOT in favor of the Jewish nation prospering in their own land no matter what drivel comes out of her mouth.You are full of crap.  She is owned by Soros who hates Israel and Zionists!!!
Get educated!Seriously, get your facts straight, before sending it all out into the population
. The Devil aka, Illuminati,  owns alot of the souls of Actors. Musicians and such.. they sell their souls to the Evil doers and then the become actors , musicians etc. Makes me sick… Obama had a bunch of them to the white house just recently and gave them medals of some sort,  check it out , Obama , Clinton’s,  Soros and some top politicians  in power are all part of this Sick Society of Satan worshippers and child molesters….They are hoping for favors or the ability to rent a night in the Lincoln Bedroom!Because like her, most of those in Hollywood HAVE NO MORALS!When will people learn that the Clintons’ are nothing but users?  They have no respect for anyone,  They use these celebrites to get votes and then talk trash about them.  Sickening..I agreeHope this post opens up the truth of who Clinton really is and what she stands for..HERSELF!Vote Trump..he has your back and your interests too, and will put our America FIRST!!I HOPE BEYONCE  WILL TELL EVERYONE WHAT WAS SAID IT HAD TO HURT HER BAD I AM SOORY FOR BEYONCEI bet, that this would upset Obama and Michelle…Jay-Z is their best friends…Sorry for Beyonce. She doesn’t deserve Respect after what she has said about all Law EnforcementAMEN! She is trash!Yes she took advantage of the superbowl and made her agenda one of hate and violence
She and her dance team were paying homage to The black panthers who are nothing but hate and destruction.Sorry for that police trashing pos! No, nope, I can’t stand the way she acts and what she stands for. As far as Clinton, does this crap actually surprise anybody? She is simple white trash and all she cares about is Hillary and the All Mighty Dollar.I am NOT one bit sorry for Beyoncé! She has been dumb enough to follow that  heating, killing, lying old bat! She should know Hillary is a back-stabber!Ummm, hello! Bernie Sanders got paid hush money. It will be interesting to see how they compensate Beyoncé to keep her quiet. Trump 2016!62 mi!!ion so farBeyonce’ and JZ actually $62,000,000f fir that twi sing ‘concert’ . To draw in tbe black Vote!!Well, when you play with s**t you are going to get it on you. Hope Beyoncé learned from it. Clintons are white trash users.To hell with Beyoncé! That’s what you get for supporting a back stabbing criminal! “F” the clintonsI’M not surprised.  Beyonce is a adequate singer, her dress? is questionable.
I  wouldn’t take b a FREE CD OF HER CRAP MUSICTwo worthless creatures  cut from the same cloth ha haha.How much money did it cost Beyoncé to be there?  That was one expensive lesson.Nothing! She was paid for that. Wonder if 62m is enough to take the beating from hrc words68 million each her and JzHer TRUE side will come out ! !I think it did come out with that comment! She’s a hypocrite!!! And liar and conartist! The epitome of con games!!!Her true side IS out!I just it doesn’t come too late.No surprise Beyonce…please stop following her Hillary and Obama think they are the masters of destruction of theUSA she is using you allllll …Under her watch people are getting seriiusly hurt ..physically.
Please Vote TrumpIt shows Hillary’s hypocrisy, but Beyonce does sing trash.If this is true, it’s a huge beatdown for the Hildabeast! If Beyonce talks about it, or any of the staff that heard her, that’ll blow her black voter bloc right out if the water!and that would be a blessing for sure….#VOTETRUMPHow did you come to that conclusion? Not all black people follow Beyonce.——-  BUT YOU DON’T KNOW HER —– LIKE WE KNOW  (HER)I have kknow her the entire time of her career she has failed at everything she done she got a rapist off through corruption and has done nothing but corruption and sick twisted things her whole life she has sold out the Bengazhi men lives to this very election with nothing but corruption satanic cult to the very selling out of her kid yeah I know killary and I know about the coup of our government that was just countercoup to take her down with all her sick things she has done to America and it’s people.Is anyone Surprised . they don’t care who they useOutstanding  comment! !How can I join your group!

It has never been the people campaign, it has been for the ultra wealthy. She has openly said that she is going to raise taxes on us. Obamacare is going up… a lot. They plan to make us a poor 3rd world country. Donald hopes to repair what the last 24 years have done. I hope you can help us give him a chance.Well bouncy when will you and your moronic friends get it ? HILLARY AND BILL don’t like niggas and Jews they are only a means to an end !!!!!!!!They don’t like Catholics eitherOr AmericansGot that right..all of you…Totally uncalled forAmerica will be sold out,the hour is at hand,and she has already turned Her back on God and the only thing left is judgementThe bitch is as racist as can be .but the total ignorant will still follow her like the is parting the red sea .Just remember you followers of hillary like Moses she will let the water drown you once she is done with your ass You will have no one to blame but yourself open your  eyes  you still have time to save yourselves .The bitch is as racist as can be .but the total ignorant will still follow her like She is parting the red sea .Just remember you followers of hillary like Moses she will let the water drown you once she is done with your ass You will have no one to blame but yourself open your eyes you still have time to save yourselves .The Clintons are evil ungodly pos…   Moses led his people (slaves) out of bondage of Egypt and AFTER he parted the waters and let GOD’S persecuted people thru, GOD let waters flow back and kill the bad guys that had enslaved God/Moses people.  Clintons just wanted Beyonce to get black people vote before they let the waters come back through.  They are the bad guysKevin, you make a good point! Let’s hope her users open their eyes if they haven’t already voted for the Queen!Now maybe she will see Trump is the best choice Killarney is TRASHHow much were you paid?Hollywood is the straw that stirs the drink for TRAsH LIKE the Clintons, Obama and George SarosYeah, my bro and I was there. That look in Beyonce eye boyee dat shit was NASTY at HILLARY!Gave her the stink eye and stank face!!HEY YOU NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW IT WAS TRUE SO THEY DON’T VOTE FOR hILLARY THAT WAS WRONG WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT BEYONCEAnd that ladies and gentlemen is a racist that wants to be your President. Wake up folks and vote Trump.is there video of this?Can’t seem to find one. Which song was it?I hope this is true. Would love to watch the libtardian left  tearing themselves apart…..And this is to prove what? There is no audio or video evidence to corroborate the story. Just a right wing “reporter” (and I use that term loosely)  with a fantastical story idea which isn’t original. Simply took what happened with Trump and his hot mic (whice had evidence) and trying to turn it on Clinton. This isn’t news. It’s fallacy, and not done well at all. Lazy reporting.You’re one of those idiots, believe everything they say about Trump but all the dirt on Hillary is just right-wing blather and lies. I’ll hit you up next time I need to count sheep.HAHAHAAnd what evidence do you have that it’s false? Beyonce did stop in the song and Beyonce did take after only two songs without further adieu. So you don’t believe this story but rather have Hillary make a fool out of youDo you know all or just can’t stand the truth? Wise up , Clinton is a user , she got caught , it’s not the first time.But it’s like something she would say!!Daniel, maybe its time to pull your head out of your ass!Beyonce, tell me she did not!  I don’t put nothing pass
 the Really Rottens!!!! sorry mf’s!I see any (polite) dissenting comment gets held for moderation then deleted. How liberal of you.Just hadn’t been moderated yet. We have a small team.Really? Because I’ve read several already.Sorry this is b.s. I watched the show and nobody stormed off stage Beyonce was hugging Hilary and handed her the mic before kissing her and calmy walked off stage with her husband. It’s amazing the roadie couldn’t be found after his bogus claim!That’s what i saw on the video…I’d be glad for someone to provide video evidence to the contrary!!She hasn’t learned to keep her big mouth shut yet.But Beyoncé still preformed her services for the racist murderer without defending her music or her people didn’t she.For once Hillary was being truthful! Why was the pole dancer even there?Well that’s one time she didn’t lieHaha. So true!she and her subservient  ilk always been  slaves for fat*ss clinton and that ain’t gonna change.She uses Ppl. like no one else !.She hates Minorities until election day !In the Beyonce story, don’t mean to be picky but correct spelling is WHOAWell it surely is crap pseudo music.There ya go!  Just goes to show you Beyonce that you are just another Negro to her even if you sold your soul to the devilI doubt it is true.Done you twos heard it and was you two sittin to gether?How many times does this have to happen before they realize the ruthless person they are bowing and scraping too..about time they find out.So damn funny and fitting! Maybe now these”artists”and I use the term loosely,will finally realize what a piece of scum Hillery is.I can’t stand Hillary, but let’s not be like her and the Dem’s media, I want to hear her own voice saying these things. any person of reasonable intelligence in either party, should want to see & hear real proof of wrong doing.AgreeWow what a ungrateful witch !! There is something wrong with her, she is fake as hell.MAYBE PEOPLE WILL START REALIZING HILLARY DOESN’T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THEM….IT’S ALL FOR HER POLITICAL GAIN AND SHE WILL SAY AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES!!!  WE CANNOT HAVE HER IN THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN!!!!The Clintons have,always been for themselves. All the money in the Clinton Foundation  was put there by donors,TO the Clintons for a “charityfoundation” ..which turns out the money from the Foundation is used as their personal “bank account” to use the money for their own family…Busted as the hypocritical, pathological-psychotic thief and traitor she is.THAT WAS THE REAL HILLARY,THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS BEEN KIDDING IT’S SELF FOR DECADES THINKING THE DEMOCRATS WERE WITH THEM , FOR THEM. DEMOCRATS ARE WHAT BLACKS SHOULD CALL THE ANTI-AMERICAN RACIST PARTY. THE D.N.C. HAS HAD A HATETRED FOR BLACKS FOR 150 YRS AND WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THEM UNDER THEIR THUMP AND DOWN ON THE PLANTATION. IT’S TIME FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO PULL THEIR COLLECTIVE HEADS OUT OF THE SAND AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE REAL DEMOCRATS, ‘CAUSE IF THEY DON’T THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT #’S WILL EXPLODE  AND POVERTY WILL EXPLODE….THAT’S DEMOCRAT BIG GOVERNMENT CONTROL. CLINTON IS BIG GOVERNMENT ,IS AN ELITIST,IS A RACIST,AND DID TAKE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FROM THEIR BABY THE K.K.K. FREEDOM FROM DEMOCTAT CONTROL IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP.Pop diesel..agree with your post 100%!!  Ok if we borrow it and share??So Jay Z and Beyonce conduct a FREE concert for Hillary Clinton.. Hum.. Yet Donald Trump stands alone with JUST his 15,000 supporters, who came for JUST Trump.. no help form the so called “star power”!! And let’s not forget his republican party.. Talk about weak!!
I personally find it very insulting that Hillary Clinton thinks so low of the black community, she plays them for a fool and thinks they are down right stupid! I hope you all enjoyed the FREE concert she supplied you with. Because that ALL she will do for you!
Think about this, Hillary Clinton thinks that the only way black people will ever understand the election process and the fact that they should even vote, period…is to use the words FREE and WELFARE. Hillary has purposely bound a large percentage of the black community in a vice, locked them down and they are under her sick control!
GET OUT AND VOTE PEOPLE!! DON’T BELIEVE THE SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN THEY SAY “THERE IS NO WAY FOR TRUMP TO WIN, HE HAS A NARROW PATH” it’s all mind control.. they want us to feel there is no point to go out and vote if SHE is going to win anyway!! GO OUT AND VOTE!!! Bring your family and friends, tell your coworkers to through their kids in the mini van and get to the polls!!
Beyonce.. put that fist up.. you know, the one you display so proudly in honor for the black panthers.. and punch yourself right in the mouth with it!
Whoever your voting for just GO VOTE!!I agree, Missy.  Free stuff.  I saw a clip from the show and Hillary was yet again offensive after JZ and his crew did a horrific, violent rap that called women bitches and hoes and talk about drugs and killin niggas – oh yes, and hoes.  She was euphoric as she clapped at the end shouting happily, “THIS IS YOU, AMERICA!  THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT!” All the people clapped and shouted approval.  Really people?  She likes to pander to black people with a tremendous disconnect.  She actually believes black people are all gangsta… and ignorant.
Meanwhile, Trump STILL had more people at his rallies without free food and free concert tickets.  I hope those people had a good time and then vote trump anyway.Even Left lib’d can’t say it’s ok for what Hillary did! Truthful who the hell want a EVIL👺LYING MURERING WITCH I’ll NEVER FORGET BENGHAZI!She is always flapping her yap! Why more people haven’t caught on is beyond me?  I find it rather amusing, how stupid her minions truly are…Why there isn’t more truth from HRC’s *#@&^%! garbage gutter mouth???  It’s because HilLiarY does not allow anyone in her presence to have a cell phone.http://www.mediazone.news/index.php/2016/11/04/every-american-will-

hillary-clinton-on-pedophilia-and-treason-charges/#comment-1385Let’s get on with it!Clinton doesn’t even know how NOT to bite a gift horse in the mouth!! What a stupid, arrogant, hateful person – couldn’t she have just enjoyed the show?The real Hillary just opened her racist bigoted mouth. Go figure!Ooops, the only time Hillary doesn’t lie is when she thinks no one is listening.Go 4 it .Hillary will bust it wide openThey deserved each other .You and your man are always welcome on the Trump train!!!! We one big happy family!! No we are not racist!!Hillary is smarter than B…and Z….But not T…Trump….the blacks have heard Hillary say racist things …they are stupid FOR supporting her.Where is the video showing this. .. young voters don’t realize that she is a Grand Puba Princess  the KKK. . Her mentor was bird. They Democratic Party has been the one for over a hundred years keeping people enslaved and that’s what your welfare is.House keeper printing classified emails and Clinton has good judgement.! Go figure.Does this surprise anyone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well it is ghetto directed trash music.  Clinton knows how to fuk things up. LolHILLARY IS SO UGLY AND  SHE WOULD NOT BE THE PRESIDENT THAT WE NEED.thank you..I would love to be the Hangman for Her and Bill Clinton!LOL how stupid..she gets bustedas always, killary will get a free pass.
liberals are nothing if not unified. they hate each other behind closed doors, but they march in lockstep to vote.This is proof I’ll be voting Green Party!!
The LORD is in control!!I don’t care for Beyonce or her music but have enough class to never say something like that whether anyone could hear me or not!Hillary is a failure even at her own eventsShe is just as racist as Beyonce.Oh God, her private persona has been leaked again.  I hate when that happens.  She just messed with the Queen B.DON’T TURN YOUR BACK ON HILLARHOID, SHE’LL CUT YOUR THROAT, OR STOP PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN HER POCKET SHE’LL TAKE YOU DOWN SOME WAY.Gotta love it!She is a hypocrite right along with Michelle Obama. They are offended by the People’s Choice for President Donald Trump’s locker room word Pussy and yet Tom Jones sings it: What’s New Pussy Cat and then they use Beyonce foul mouth and F words and N words to get people to go and vote for her. She even has Obama committing criminal act telling illegals to vote and they won’t get in trouble…that is a felony also. And she uses the Democrats foundation of KKK against Donald when they are using black lives matter group to cause disturbances at our rallies and that black singer using the F and N for every other word during a concert for Hillary herself. She is a hypocrite.She is such a lovely grant mother type person, trash although I am not a fan of Beyoncé either, but I certainly not kiss her backside then trash her! But the kindly lady (NOT) who wants to be our president has no such qualms! She is trash a traitor, liar, thief and many things America does not know about yet!well..believe it or not, that was not racist….I don’t like that music either..torture to have to sit and listen to it…the ONLY thing I agree with hillary onIs that why JayZ thug hit someone as he was leaving?What is so surprising about this?  Just another one of her “hate tactics” to use and abuse for her so called gain.  Minorities wake up!!  Do you really trust a Jezabel like Hillary!Beyonce and Hillary are some of the most racist people I’ve ever seen.. they both deserve each other and I would rather clean a bathroom with a toothbrush than to support either one of them… we do not need her or any of her blackliesmatter clan….We’ve been trying to tell people for months that Hillary hates America!  ALL Americans!  Beyonce, that goes for you, too.  She is an elitist of the worse kind that goes miles beyond racist or bigot.  You should vote Trump.why is beyonce so shocked I thought all trash stuck together, beyonce is just as bad as Hillary so it like the pot calling the kettle black or in this case negro!Corrections: *to not say and do these things*I think this is funny as hell…oh well she gets a  taste the fruits of Hilary Clinton lap it up baby girl aren’t you proud to support such a wonderful women✌No surprise….except to Beyonce.  Maybe now she will understand who Hillary really is behind her lies.  Not a nice woman and she’s only looking for votes.I doubt this story is true. I do however feel that Killary has just been using everyone, especially Black people in this country to get what she wants most in life. I have never felt that her concern for the plight of Black Americans is real. She moved to Harlem to try to prove to them that she accepts them, but it was just a move to become a Senator from NY. I’ll give it to her for keeping to her strategy.  If her record alone isn’t enough to convince people that she and Bill are just two crooks using the system, there’s nothing anyone can say that will change their mind. Barack Obama said it during the race against her,”Hillary Clinton is a liar, a crook, and has never done anything that she’s promised.”  He further stated that she isn’t fit to be president. I truly feel bad for those who are so geared toward their party that they will let Lucifer in the door.When are people going to “get it”? HILLARY CLINTON IS TRASH!!!No one likes the bitch Beyonce so truth is, Hillary gained thousands of votes…This is a clip from the show.Lol Beyonce.. Who cares? She is ghetto trash… Lmfao what did you expect Beyonce? You side with a liar, you get played..Who knows if this is true or not. I’m just surprised that JZ, ( Who seems to be an intelligent man) what allow himself and his wife to be used at the Democratic Party.Hillary Has bleeding hemroids! Cut her some slack… Bleeding hemroids is no laughing matter! If I knew, of a quick remedy, I would put my finger right on it… that would prepare her to be Potis.PLEASE NO MORE CLINTON CARTEL!  THEY WILL DESTROY THE USA AND LEAVE WITH EVEN MORE MONEY. SHES A LYING MURDERING THIEF.As an American citizen I recognize that the 2nd amendment is important but there is one that is greater, the 1st amendment.  By posting this I am expressing my 1st amendment right.  I hope you will be willing to allow me to express my views freely.  Otherwise you are doing exactly what you claim the government is doing. I have removed anything personally offensive to other  readers therefore I don’t see why you wouldn’t allow it.  Thanks in advance.To all the people on the Trump bandwagon, I have this message for you….wake up and use your brain! All of you spewing hatred over a false story. This is ridiculous. Donald Trump has been playing each and every one of you from the very beginning. Feeding off of your fears in order to win your votes. You are the sheep and he the master manipulator. This man can say absolutely anything and still you believe him. As a matter of fact he HAS said just about any and everything and you have believed him. Just like this story he has been caught in several lies throughout this campaign. It’s like he says whatever he feels is going to sway the most people his way regardless of the truth behind it. He changes his stance and position on topics as the wind blows and you blow right along with it. He rants on social media like an immature toddler and has no self-control at 70 years old!! Yes, he has built a real estate empire but that doesn’t mean he can lead this country. Those are two very different things. He is a character, a TV personality whose ego is so big that he wants to be the most powerful man in the world. He doesn’t have what it takes to lead the country. How foolish are all of you for allowing yourselves to fall for this circus? How do you elect a president that is ignorant regarding foreign policy? How as a woman can you elect a president that has no respect for you or your gender and has proven it time and time again? How as a minority (for the few that plan on voting for him) do you back someone who has no regard for you or your race? It’s not about being PC or sensitive to harsh words and rhetoric.  Listen to what he says.  He has told you exactly who and what he is….so believe him.  As a presidential candidate the man has zero substance. His entire campaign is built on tearing others down, spreading fear, and sheer negativity. He doesn’t have real plans for this country. The campaign slogan he uses “Make America Great Again” was stolen from Ronald Reagan. He is taking your most revered Republican figure and using it to his advantage.  He speaks very vaguely, constantly promising that he is going to fix this or that but never saying how. You are fed up with government but yet are willing to elect someone who is doing the same thing you claim politicians do.  You know why he can’t see how he’ll fix it?…because he doesn’t know how and doesn’t plan to. He just wants to be the most powerful man on the planet…that’s his end game and you are so foolishly his puppets helping him complete his goal. Whether conscious or subconscious, many of you are so blinded by your hatred for OUR president (who happens to be black) that you are willing to vote for the most unqualified candidate probably ever.  Like a cunning fox, he strategically changed his viewpoints on several key issues to align himself with the Republican party because it was his best chance of being nominated…AND IT WORKED!!! He’s probably the first non-Republican to be nominated by the Republican party. My fellow Americans what you are doing is an absolute disgrace and it is extremely sad that you have let him get this far and may get him all the way to the White House. You have been manipulated. You have been lied to. You have been hoodwinked and you have been bamboozled. You cherish your 2nd amendment right to bear arms over everything else and have allowed a con artist to take complete advantage of that. Trump won’t “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”. He can’t. He knows there’s no greater America than the present version and is trying to take full advantage. Not convinced, well in what other time could a sleazy, racist, tax-evading, TV personality, with tons of money, no moral compass, and fake Christian values become President of the United States?  None.  Someone who has no government experience, little to no understanding of foreign policy, and no regard for the people of this country? There has never been another time.  No time like the present fellow citizens which is why if Trump is elected president America will never be great again but by the time you realize that it will be too late. Congratulations, by attempting to “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”, you may have permanently ruined it for our children and for future generations.  Thanks a bunch.Before you get your panties in a wad, I do not mean for this post to sound as though I dislike America. It is a beautiful place with wonderful people.I am trying to figure out how to get away from the amount of control the government has on my life. Sad part is…There isn’t one….hear me out. I have to have money to do all of the things I need to live because somehow we got tricked into believing these papers and coins are powerful. And even if I bought land and did the homestead thing, I still have to pay taxes, but why? And to whom? And what do they do with the money I am paying them? It seems to me, like I’m making a bunch of crazy people rich while I’m left here wondering where I went wrong in life. (I’ll tell you, nowhere . I’m pretty great okay, some not nice things in my past, but this isn’t about that and I was young.)It seems to me like they just keep saying things like, no you don’t need wells anymore drink city water, and a lot of people do. And then they put fluoride in our water! (I won’t even go into the crisis of the Flint, Michigan water, that is still needing repaired, right? Or the recent pipeline problem.) And instead of trying to use cheaper more efficient fuel they continue to build pipelines through our lands that will poison our natural water sources. Not to mention the other tremendous issues ecologically which will result from not finding new ways.While we let them do it to us!But why? If we buy something from somewhere is it not ours? Then who are they to tell us what we can do on the land that we bought from them?! And why do we pay taxes for them to tell us what to do on property we bought from them?!I had a lot more but I lost where I was going, I’m so infuriated and astonished at what is happening all around me. Not just in America, but the world. (and beyond 👻👽)I’m telling you all if we don’t start to unite they will kill us all. More of us can be born and bred until they figure out how to get robots to be their minions.…..they keep telling me that I am free…….but they tell me what I can put in my body……..they tell me that I  am free… but THEY put stuff in MY body I would not and somehow that is okay…they tell me that I am free…..and they force me to pay for something that was not affordable in the first place, but they can give me a number where if I meet poverty level I won’t be forced to pay the fine for not buying the insurance I already could not afford….they tell me that I am free and they will give me everything I need while making it impossible to access or find out any information on anything…they tell me I am free.#WecanbefreeI don’t get a sound bite on this site; however, it was reported (and disputed on several websites) that Killary said: “I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”Is there any hope for our nation with all the liberal cool-aid drinking people hooked on Hillary’s liesREMEMBER, when you vote today, Hillary, the DNC, the Washington & Hollywood Elites, the Media AND the Obama Administration are COUNTING ON your POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, your INDIFFERENCE, AND your IGNORANCE of their CRIMES, MANIPULATIONS AND LIES!!!   It’s TIME for WE THE PEOPLE to TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK!!!!“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”  I guess Hillary may have some normal traits.STOP all this hate and learn to love each other, if you don’t like what others say take them out of your life, don’t fill it with hate, if there more love in this world this will make it better for everyone, colour is skin deep, under that, we are all the same, our flesh is red with blood, if yours is different then you came from another planet. Give a strange a hug and be kind to each other.Do black people just believe any bs?








During Friday Night’s Hillary Clinton rally in Ohio, Beyonce’ Knowles, known for her liberal ideals and anti-police rhetoric, was performing a free set for the murderous email queen when she suddenly stopped singing. She turned towards the side of the stage where Hillary was standing and said, “You’re in my earpiece.”Clinton, looking surprised, gave a smile and started clapping. Beyonce’ continued her performance but cut it short after just two songs. She was seen storming off stage and leaving the venue in a limousine shortly thereafter.Wikileaks Gives Hillary An Ultimatum: QUIT, Or We Dump Something Life-DestroyingA reporter from the local Parma Gazette asked around and found out from a sound tech that Clinton’s lapel mic was hot and all of the staff were listening when she said:“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”The Clinton campaign refused calls for comment and the roadie who gave the original report is now nowhere to be found. Hopefully his life insurance was up to date.It Was Demorats who started the KKK and they never left it. Time for black people to know you have used for over 50 years and you follow like sheepiesThat’s what Beyoncé gets!!!! LMAO  sorry not sorry for loving this!
And Killary can’t even be happy to get a free concert without being so
rude, I thought she needed the black vote? Guess BL don’t M to HRC!!!Paid them $62 million.  Not exactly free!Nothing matters to HRC except HRCLMAO!Actually hitlery paid them 62mil for the “free” concertIs it rude or did Beyonce deserve it like you imply? Can you make up your mind and whatnot or is this Tourettes?That concert wasn’t free. Campaign funds paid them $65,000,000 to jay z and BeyoncéHillary paid Beyon`ce and her husband $62 million to do this concert….it was not for free!!!http://endingthefed.com/clinton-campaign-paid-beyonce-and-jay-z-62-million-for-cleveland-concert-to-secure-black-votes.htmllmao it wasnt free she paid out 65 mil for that last sec concertThe best think that Beyonce can do is to vote for  Trump and let her know it.That will  make her even madder.LMAO….good enough for both of themI want to understand, why did Black Americans stand at attention, while Obama was talking down to them, as if they were part of a Chain Gang, taking orders from their prison guards? I thought people have freedom of choice, not someone elses ideology. Wake up Black America, the Democrats are playing you for your votes. The could give a crap less about your struggles or difficulties.What black people as if you know all black people, as if you know what all black people think or feel. You don’t know that…. Stop with the assumption. We ate not one mind.Hillary’s use of Jay-Z and other entertainers in a feeble attempt of pandering the minority vote demonstrates her / liberals thoughts regarding minority people of the nation.
If you don’t understand this, Think;
Why can’t she bring to you a message of intellectual value with no question in her mind you’ll understand?
She banks on her thoughts of your ignorance to further her agenda.
Non minority supporters of Hillary should be considered racist pigs for condoning her strategies…not sure what you mean?~ well… ur black ass is DEF. one minded, cuz you can not even fkn spell right…(Lol)  All Hail BLM… B*lack  L*azy  M*onkeys….(LMMF*W*AO)Hey Rev. Bill, talk like that is not going to unite this country.  Please, we have to stop the hate.Rev Bill your a jackass. I was a Trump supporter, but I certainly have no animosity toward the black people in our society.“We ate not one mind”  WOW…. LMAOObama is a white liberal anointed ROYALIST CLASS BLACK OVERSEER OF HIS RACE AND IS DOING HIS STEP N FETCH IT DUTIES TO HIS WHITE LIBERAL MASTERS~~~PERIOD!!!The “white liberal masters” are Jews, not white.I believe that roadie has done his last gig. His name was found on 4 ballots this weekhere is a better analysis of Dem/GOP stands on civil rights. phttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/28/republicans-party-of-civil-rightsAbsolutely true.AMEN!First get your history right. The Democrats were “Dixicrats” when they formed the KKK, and they are now YOUR KKK!  Black people were no part of the Dixicrats!  Don’t try to give us your white supremistthe dems and republicans have switched positions through the years their beleifs at that time would have made  the democrats republicans now so in other woulds the philosophy than is the same as the present day repulicans ill believe this when i hear it fro BeyonceOh the Ole switcharoo huh? Lmao! So Strom Thurman was the whole democratic party huh? He was the only democrat to switch parties during that time! Wow big switch huh? SMDHHe beyonce there s time to vote TRUMP!I agree!!Time to makes America great again! Vote for Trump!Don’t be fooled you fool. You and your family was poor then, too.Hilly is nothing but trash! I do not see why the Hollywood set are into her when she just uses them for their money and her gain!
Wonder what she says about them when they are not around?Because they are involved in the Illuminati also.The Hollywood set follows Hillary because they live in the same elitist world Hillsry does.  They are completely out of touch with the reality we live in. They are blind to the hypocrisy and corruption in the Democratic Party because it doesn’t touch them.Exactly!idk why she would think she is any different than all the others they use and then toss aside like yesterdays garbage…smdh….i thought she was supposed to be so dam smart….HA….guess that was a lie tooTheir Sheeple, and Killary was probably loaded again!!!Their sheeple? Whose sheeple? Trump or Hillary?Money… They’re paid!Hollywood is owned by Zionists. Just like Hillary.I am a Zionist and I am for Trump!!!I don’t think you understand the term zionist.   “a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel. It was established as a political organization in 1897 under Theodor Herzl, and was later led by Chaim Weizmann.”Hillary Clinton is definitely NOT in favor of the Jewish nation prospering in their own land no matter what drivel comes out of her mouth.You are full of crap.  She is owned by Soros who hates Israel and Zionists!!!
Get educated!Seriously, get your facts straight, before sending it all out into the population
. The Devil aka, Illuminati,  owns alot of the souls of Actors. Musicians and such.. they sell their souls to the Evil doers and then the become actors , musicians etc. Makes me sick… Obama had a bunch of them to the white house just recently and gave them medals of some sort,  check it out , Obama , Clinton’s,  Soros and some top politicians  in power are all part of this Sick Society of Satan worshippers and child molesters….They are hoping for favors or the ability to rent a night in the Lincoln Bedroom!Because like her, most of those in Hollywood HAVE NO MORALS!When will people learn that the Clintons’ are nothing but users?  They have no respect for anyone,  They use these celebrites to get votes and then talk trash about them.  Sickening..I agreeHope this post opens up the truth of who Clinton really is and what she stands for..HERSELF!Vote Trump..he has your back and your interests too, and will put our America FIRST!!I HOPE BEYONCE  WILL TELL EVERYONE WHAT WAS SAID IT HAD TO HURT HER BAD I AM SOORY FOR BEYONCEI bet, that this would upset Obama and Michelle…Jay-Z is their best friends…Sorry for Beyonce. She doesn’t deserve Respect after what she has said about all Law EnforcementAMEN! She is trash!Yes she took advantage of the superbowl and made her agenda one of hate and violence
She and her dance team were paying homage to The black panthers who are nothing but hate and destruction.Sorry for that police trashing pos! No, nope, I can’t stand the way she acts and what she stands for. As far as Clinton, does this crap actually surprise anybody? She is simple white trash and all she cares about is Hillary and the All Mighty Dollar.I am NOT one bit sorry for Beyoncé! She has been dumb enough to follow that  heating, killing, lying old bat! She should know Hillary is a back-stabber!Ummm, hello! Bernie Sanders got paid hush money. It will be interesting to see how they compensate Beyoncé to keep her quiet. Trump 2016!62 mi!!ion so farBeyonce’ and JZ actually $62,000,000f fir that twi sing ‘concert’ . To draw in tbe black Vote!!Well, when you play with s**t you are going to get it on you. Hope Beyoncé learned from it. Clintons are white trash users.To hell with Beyoncé! That’s what you get for supporting a back stabbing criminal! “F” the clintonsI’M not surprised.  Beyonce is a adequate singer, her dress? is questionable.
I  wouldn’t take b a FREE CD OF HER CRAP MUSICTwo worthless creatures  cut from the same cloth ha haha.How much money did it cost Beyoncé to be there?  That was one expensive lesson.Nothing! She was paid for that. Wonder if 62m is enough to take the beating from hrc words68 million each her and JzHer TRUE side will come out ! !I think it did come out with that comment! She’s a hypocrite!!! And liar and conartist! The epitome of con games!!!Her true side IS out!I just it doesn’t come too late.No surprise Beyonce…please stop following her Hillary and Obama think they are the masters of destruction of theUSA she is using you allllll …Under her watch people are getting seriiusly hurt ..physically.
Please Vote TrumpIt shows Hillary’s hypocrisy, but Beyonce does sing trash.If this is true, it’s a huge beatdown for the Hildabeast! If Beyonce talks about it, or any of the staff that heard her, that’ll blow her black voter bloc right out if the water!and that would be a blessing for sure….#VOTETRUMPHow did you come to that conclusion?

It has never been the people campaign, it has been for the ultra wealthy. She has openly said that she is going to raise taxes on us. Obamacare is going up… a lot. They plan to make us a poor 3rd world country. Donald hopes to repair what the last 24 years have done. I hope you can help us give him a chance.Well bouncy when will you and your moronic friends get it ? HILLARY AND BILL don’t like niggas and Jews they are only a means to an end !!!!!!!!They don’t like Catholics eitherOr AmericansGot that right..all of you…Totally uncalled forAmerica will be sold out,the hour is at hand,and she has already turned Her back on God and the only thing left is judgementThe bitch is as racist as can be .but the total ignorant will still follow her like the is parting the red sea .Just remember you followers of hillary like Moses she will let the water drown you once she is done with your ass You will have no one to blame but yourself open your  eyes  you still have time to save yourselves .The bitch is as racist as can be .but the total ignorant will still follow her like She is parting the red sea .Just remember you followers of hillary like Moses she will let the water drown you once she is done with your ass You will have no one to blame but yourself open your eyes you still have time to save yourselves .The Clintons are evil ungodly pos…   Moses led his people (slaves) out of bondage of Egypt and AFTER he parted the waters and let GOD’S persecuted people thru, GOD let waters flow back and kill the bad guys that had enslaved God/Moses people.  Clintons just wanted Beyonce to get black people vote before they let the waters come back through.  They are the bad guysKevin, you make a good point! Let’s hope her users open their eyes if they haven’t already voted for the Queen!Now maybe she will see Trump is the best choice Killarney is TRASHHow much were you paid?Hollywood is the straw that stirs the drink for TRAsH LIKE the Clintons, Obama and George SarosYeah, my bro and I was there. That look in Beyonce eye boyee dat shit was NASTY at HILLARY!Gave her the stink eye and stank face!!HEY YOU NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW IT WAS TRUE SO THEY DON’T VOTE FOR hILLARY THAT WAS WRONG WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT BEYONCEAnd that ladies and gentlemen is a racist that wants to be your President. Wake up folks and vote Trump.is there video of this?Can’t seem to find one. Which song was it?I hope this is true. Would love to watch the libtardian left  tearing themselves apart…..And this is to prove what? There is no audio or video evidence to corroborate the story. Just a right wing “reporter” (and I use that term loosely)  with a fantastical story idea which isn’t original. Simply took what happened with Trump and his hot mic (whice had evidence) and trying to turn it on Clinton. This isn’t news. It’s fallacy, and not done well at all. Lazy reporting.You’re one of those idiots, believe everything they say about Trump but all the dirt on Hillary is just right-wing blather and lies. I’ll hit you up next time I need to count sheep.HAHAHAAnd what evidence do you have that it’s false? Beyonce did stop in the song and Beyonce did take after only two songs without further adieu. So you don’t believe this story but rather have Hillary make a fool out of youDo you know all or just can’t stand the truth? Wise up , Clinton is a user , she got caught , it’s not the first time.But it’s like something she would say!!Daniel, maybe its time to pull your head out of your ass!Beyonce, tell me she did not!  I don’t put nothing pass
 the Really Rottens!!!! sorry mf’s!I see any (polite) dissenting comment gets held for moderation then deleted. How liberal of you.Just hadn’t been moderated yet. We have a small team.Really? Because I’ve read several already.Sorry this is b.s. I watched the show and nobody stormed off stage Beyonce was hugging Hilary and handed her the mic before kissing her and calmy walked off stage with her husband. It’s amazing the roadie couldn’t be found after his bogus claim!That’s what i saw on the video…I’d be glad for someone to provide video evidence to the contrary!!She hasn’t learned to keep her big mouth shut yet.But Beyoncé still preformed her services for the racist murderer without defending her music or her people didn’t she.For once Hillary was being truthful! Why was the pole dancer even there?Well that’s one time she didn’t lieHaha. So true!she and her subservient  ilk always been  slaves for fat*ss clinton and that ain’t gonna change.She uses Ppl. like no one else !.She hates Minorities until election day !In the Beyonce story, don’t mean to be picky but correct spelling is WHOAWell it surely is crap pseudo music.There ya go!  Just goes to show you Beyonce that you are just another Negro to her even if you sold your soul to the devilI doubt it is true.Done you twos heard it and was you two sittin to gether?How many times does this have to happen before they realize the ruthless person they are bowing and scraping too..about time they find out.So damn funny and fitting! Maybe now these”artists”and I use the term loosely,will finally realize what a piece of scum Hillery is.I can’t stand Hillary, but let’s not be like her and the Dem’s media, I want to hear her own voice saying these things. any person of reasonable intelligence in either party, should want to see & hear real proof of wrong doing.AgreeWow what a ungrateful witch !! There is something wrong with her, she is fake as hell.MAYBE PEOPLE WILL START REALIZING HILLARY DOESN’T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THEM….IT’S ALL FOR HER POLITICAL GAIN AND SHE WILL SAY AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES!!!  WE CANNOT HAVE HER IN THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN!!!!The Clintons have,always been for themselves. All the money in the Clinton Foundation  was put there by donors,TO the Clintons for a “charityfoundation” ..which turns out the money from the Foundation is used as their personal “bank account” to use the money for their own family…Busted as the hypocritical, pathological-psychotic thief and traitor she is.THAT WAS THE REAL HILLARY,THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS BEEN KIDDING IT’S SELF FOR DECADES THINKING THE DEMOCRATS WERE WITH THEM , FOR THEM. DEMOCRATS ARE WHAT BLACKS SHOULD CALL THE ANTI-AMERICAN RACIST PARTY. THE D.N.C. HAS HAD A HATETRED FOR BLACKS FOR 150 YRS AND WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THEM UNDER THEIR THUMP AND DOWN ON THE PLANTATION. IT’S TIME FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO PULL THEIR COLLECTIVE HEADS OUT OF THE SAND AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE REAL DEMOCRATS, ‘CAUSE IF THEY DON’T THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT #’S WILL EXPLODE  AND POVERTY WILL EXPLODE….THAT’S DEMOCRAT BIG GOVERNMENT CONTROL. CLINTON IS BIG GOVERNMENT ,IS AN ELITIST,IS A RACIST,AND DID TAKE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FROM THEIR BABY THE K.K.K. FREEDOM FROM DEMOCTAT CONTROL IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP.Pop diesel..agree with your post 100%!!  Ok if we borrow it and share??So Jay Z and Beyonce conduct a FREE concert for Hillary Clinton.. Hum.. Yet Donald Trump stands alone with JUST his 15,000 supporters, who came for JUST Trump.. no help form the so called “star power”!! And let’s not forget his republican party.. Talk about weak!!
I personally find it very insulting that Hillary Clinton thinks so low of the black community, she plays them for a fool and thinks they are down right stupid! I hope you all enjoyed the FREE concert she supplied you with. Because that ALL she will do for you!
Think about this, Hillary Clinton thinks that the only way black people will ever understand the election process and the fact that they should even vote, period…is to use the words FREE and WELFARE. Hillary has purposely bound a large percentage of the black community in a vice, locked them down and they are under her sick control!
GET OUT AND VOTE PEOPLE!! DON’T BELIEVE THE SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN THEY SAY “THERE IS NO WAY FOR TRUMP TO WIN, HE HAS A NARROW PATH” it’s all mind control.. they want us to feel there is no point to go out and vote if SHE is going to win anyway!! GO OUT AND VOTE!!! Bring your family and friends, tell your coworkers to through their kids in the mini van and get to the polls!!
Beyonce.. put that fist up.. you know, the one you display so proudly in honor for the black panthers.. and punch yourself right in the mouth with it!
Whoever your voting for just GO VOTE!!I agree, Missy.  Free stuff.  I saw a clip from the show and Hillary was yet again offensive after JZ and his crew did a horrific, violent rap that called women bitches and hoes and talk about drugs and killin niggas – oh yes, and hoes.  She was euphoric as she clapped at the end shouting happily, “THIS IS YOU, AMERICA!  THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT!” All the people clapped and shouted approval.  Really people?  She likes to pander to black people with a tremendous disconnect.  She actually believes black people are all gangsta… and ignorant.
Meanwhile, Trump STILL had more people at his rallies without free food and free concert tickets.  I hope those people had a good time and then vote trump anyway.Even Left lib’d can’t say it’s ok for what Hillary did! Truthful who the hell want a EVIL👺LYING MURERING WITCH I’ll NEVER FORGET BENGHAZI!She is always flapping her yap! Why more people haven’t caught on is beyond me?  I find it rather amusing, how stupid her minions truly are…Why there isn’t more truth from HRC’s *#@&^%! garbage gutter mouth???  It’s because HilLiarY does not allow anyone in her presence to have a cell phone.http://www.mediazone.news/index.php/2016/11/04/every-american-will-

What a stupid, arrogant, hateful person – couldn’t she have just enjoyed the show?The real Hillary just opened her racist bigoted mouth. Go figure!Ooops, the only time Hillary doesn’t lie is when she thinks no one is listening.Go 4 it .Hillary will bust it wide openThey deserved each other .You and your man are always welcome on the Trump train!!!! We one big happy family!! No we are not racist!!Hillary is smarter than B…and Z….But not T…Trump….the blacks have heard Hillary say racist things …they are stupid FOR supporting her.Where is the video showing this. .. young voters don’t realize that she is a Grand Puba Princess  the KKK. . Her mentor was bird. They Democratic Party has been the one for over a hundred years keeping people enslaved and that’s what your welfare is.House keeper printing classified emails and Clinton has good judgement.! Go figure.Does this surprise anyone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well it is ghetto directed trash music.  Clinton knows how to fuk things up. LolHILLARY IS SO UGLY AND  SHE WOULD NOT BE THE PRESIDENT THAT WE NEED.thank you..I would love to be the Hangman for Her and Bill Clinton!LOL how stupid..she gets bustedas always, killary will get a free pass.
liberals are nothing if not unified. they hate each other behind closed doors, but they march in lockstep to vote.This is proof I’ll be voting Green Party!!
The LORD is in control!!I don’t care for Beyonce or her music but have enough class to never say something like that whether anyone could hear me or not!Hillary is a failure even at her own eventsShe is just as racist as Beyonce.Oh God, her private persona has been leaked again.  I hate when that happens.  She just messed with the Queen B.DON’T TURN YOUR BACK ON HILLARHOID, SHE’LL CUT YOUR THROAT, OR STOP PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN HER POCKET SHE’LL TAKE YOU DOWN SOME WAY.Gotta love it!She is a hypocrite right along with Michelle Obama. They are offended by the People’s Choice for President Donald Trump’s locker room word Pussy and yet Tom Jones sings it: What’s New Pussy Cat and then they use Beyonce foul mouth and F words and N words to get people to go and vote for her. She even has Obama committing criminal act telling illegals to vote and they won’t get in trouble…that is a felony also. And she uses the Democrats foundation of KKK against Donald when they are using black lives matter group to cause disturbances at our rallies and that black singer using the F and N for every other word during a concert for Hillary herself. She is a hypocrite.She is such a lovely grant mother type person, trash although I am not a fan of Beyoncé either, but I certainly not kiss her backside then trash her! But the kindly lady (NOT) who wants to be our president has no such qualms! She is trash a traitor, liar, thief and many things America does not know about yet!well..believe it or not, that was not racist….I don’t like that music either..torture to have to sit and listen to it…the ONLY thing I agree with hillary onIs that why JayZ thug hit someone as he was leaving?What is so surprising about this?  Just another one of her “hate tactics” to use and abuse for her so called gain.  Minorities wake up!!  Do you really trust a Jezabel like Hillary!Beyonce and Hillary are some of the most racist people I’ve ever seen.. they both deserve each other and I would rather clean a bathroom with a toothbrush than to support either one of them… we do not need her or any of her blackliesmatter clan….We’ve been trying to tell people for months that Hillary hates America!  ALL Americans!  Beyonce, that goes for you, too.  She is an elitist of the worse kind that goes miles beyond racist or bigot.  You should vote Trump.why is beyonce so shocked I thought all trash stuck together, beyonce is just as bad as Hillary so it like the pot calling the kettle black or in this case negro!Corrections: *to not say and do these things*I think this is funny as hell…oh well she gets a  taste the fruits of Hilary Clinton lap it up baby girl aren’t you proud to support such a wonderful women✌No surprise….except to Beyonce.  Maybe now she will understand who Hillary really is behind her lies.  Not a nice woman and she’s only looking for votes.I doubt this story is true. I do however feel that Killary has just been using everyone, especially Black people in this country to get what she wants most in life. I have never felt that her concern for the plight of Black Americans is real. She moved to Harlem to try to prove to them that she accepts them, but it was just a move to become a Senator from NY. I’ll give it to her for keeping to her strategy.  If her record alone isn’t enough to convince people that she and Bill are just two crooks using the system, there’s nothing anyone can say that will change their mind. Barack Obama said it during the race against her,”Hillary Clinton is a liar, a crook, and has never done anything that she’s promised.”  He further stated that she isn’t fit to be president. I truly feel bad for those who are so geared toward their party that they will let Lucifer in the door.When are people going to “get it”? HILLARY CLINTON IS TRASH!!!No one likes the bitch Beyonce so truth is, Hillary gained thousands of votes…This is a clip from the show.Lol Beyonce.. Who cares? She is ghetto trash… Lmfao what did you expect Beyonce? You side with a liar, you get played..Who knows if this is true or not. I’m just surprised that JZ, ( Who seems to be an intelligent man) what allow himself and his wife to be used at the Democratic Party.Hillary Has bleeding hemroids! Cut her some slack… Bleeding hemroids is no laughing matter! If I knew, of a quick remedy, I would put my finger right on it… that would prepare her to be Potis.PLEASE NO MORE CLINTON CARTEL!  THEY WILL DESTROY THE USA AND LEAVE WITH EVEN MORE MONEY. SHES A LYING MURDERING THIEF.As an American citizen I recognize that the 2nd amendment is important but there is one that is greater, the 1st amendment.  By posting this I am expressing my 1st amendment right.  I hope you will be willing to allow me to express my views freely.  Otherwise you are doing exactly what you claim the government is doing. I have removed anything personally offensive to other  readers therefore I don’t see why you wouldn’t allow it.  Thanks in advance.To all the people on the Trump bandwagon, I have this message for you….wake up and use your brain! All of you spewing hatred over a false story. This is ridiculous. Donald Trump has been playing each and every one of you from the very beginning. Feeding off of your fears in order to win your votes. You are the sheep and he the master manipulator. This man can say absolutely anything and still you believe him. As a matter of fact he HAS said just about any and everything and you have believed him. Just like this story he has been caught in several lies throughout this campaign. It’s like he says whatever he feels is going to sway the most people his way regardless of the truth behind it. He changes his stance and position on topics as the wind blows and you blow right along with it. He rants on social media like an immature toddler and has no self-control at 70 years old!! Yes, he has built a real estate empire but that doesn’t mean he can lead this country. Those are two very different things. He is a character, a TV personality whose ego is so big that he wants to be the most powerful man in the world. He doesn’t have what it takes to lead the country. How foolish are all of you for allowing yourselves to fall for this circus? How do you elect a president that is ignorant regarding foreign policy? How as a woman can you elect a president that has no respect for you or your gender and has proven it time and time again? How as a minority (for the few that plan on voting for him) do you back someone who has no regard for you or your race? It’s not about being PC or sensitive to harsh words and rhetoric.  Listen to what he says.  He has told you exactly who and what he is….so believe him.  As a presidential candidate the man has zero substance. His entire campaign is built on tearing others down, spreading fear, and sheer negativity. He doesn’t have real plans for this country. The campaign slogan he uses “Make America Great Again” was stolen from Ronald Reagan. He is taking your most revered Republican figure and using it to his advantage.  He speaks very vaguely, constantly promising that he is going to fix this or that but never saying how. You are fed up with government but yet are willing to elect someone who is doing the same thing you claim politicians do.  You know why he can’t see how he’ll fix it?…because he doesn’t know how and doesn’t plan to. He just wants to be the most powerful man on the planet…that’s his end game and you are so foolishly his puppets helping him complete his goal. Whether conscious or subconscious, many of you are so blinded by your hatred for OUR president (who happens to be black) that you are willing to vote for the most unqualified candidate probably ever.  Like a cunning fox, he strategically changed his viewpoints on several key issues to align himself with the Republican party because it was his best chance of being nominated…AND IT WORKED!!! He’s probably the first non-Republican to be nominated by the Republican party. My fellow Americans what you are doing is an absolute disgrace and it is extremely sad that you have let him get this far and may get him all the way to the White House. You have been manipulated. You have been lied to. You have been hoodwinked and you have been bamboozled. You cherish your 2nd amendment right to bear arms over everything else and have allowed a con artist to take complete advantage of that. Trump won’t “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”. He can’t. He knows there’s no greater America than the present version and is trying to take full advantage. Not convinced, well in what other time could a sleazy, racist, tax-evading, TV personality, with tons of money, no moral compass, and fake Christian values become President of the United States?  None.  Someone who has no government experience, little to no understanding of foreign policy, and no regard for the people of this country? There has never been another time.  No time like the present fellow citizens which is why if Trump is elected president America will never be great again but by the time you realize that it will be too late. Congratulations, by attempting to “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”, you may have permanently ruined it for our children and for future generations.  Thanks a bunch.Before you get your panties in a wad, I do not mean for this post to sound as though I dislike America. It is a beautiful place with wonderful people.I am trying to figure out how to get away from the amount of control the government has on my life. Sad part is…There isn’t one….hear me out. I have to have money to do all of the things I need to live because somehow we got tricked into believing these papers and coins are powerful. And even if I bought land and did the homestead thing, I still have to pay taxes, but why? And to whom? And what do they do with the money I am paying them? It seems to me, like I’m making a bunch of crazy people rich while I’m left here wondering where I went wrong in life. (I’ll tell you, nowhere . I’m pretty great okay, some not nice things in my past, but this isn’t about that and I was young.)It seems to me like they just keep saying things like, no you don’t need wells anymore drink city water, and a lot of people do. And then they put fluoride in our water! (I won’t even go into the crisis of the Flint, Michigan water, that is still needing repaired, right? Or the recent pipeline problem.) And instead of trying to use cheaper more efficient fuel they continue to build pipelines through our lands that will poison our natural water sources. Not to mention the other tremendous issues ecologically which will result from not finding new ways.While we let them do it to us!But why? If we buy something from somewhere is it not ours? Then who are they to tell us what we can do on the land that we bought from them?! And why do we pay taxes for them to tell us what to do on property we bought from them?!I had a lot more but I lost where I was going, I’m so infuriated and astonished at what is happening all around me. Not just in America, but the world. (and beyond 👻👽)I’m telling you all if we don’t start to unite they will kill us all. More of us can be born and bred until they figure out how to get robots to be their minions.…..they keep telling me that I am free…….but they tell me what I can put in my body……..they tell me that I  am free… but THEY put stuff in MY body I would not and somehow that is okay…they tell me that I am free…..and they force me to pay for something that was not affordable in the first place, but they can give me a number where if I meet poverty level I won’t be forced to pay the fine for not buying the insurance I already could not afford….they tell me that I am free and they will give me everything I need while making it impossible to access or find out any information on anything…they tell me I am free.#WecanbefreeI don’t get a sound bite on this site; however, it was reported (and disputed on several websites) that Killary said: “I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”Is there any hope for our nation with all the liberal cool-aid drinking people hooked on Hillary’s liesREMEMBER, when you vote today, Hillary, the DNC, the Washington & Hollywood Elites, the Media AND the Obama Administration are COUNTING ON your POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, your INDIFFERENCE, AND your IGNORANCE of their CRIMES, MANIPULATIONS AND LIES!!!   It’s TIME for WE THE PEOPLE to TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK!!!!“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”  I guess Hillary may have some normal traits.STOP all this hate and learn to love each other, if you don’t like what others say take them out of your life, don’t fill it with hate, if there more love in this world this will make it better for everyone, colour is skin deep, under that, we are all the same, our flesh is red with blood, if yours is different then you came from another planet. Give a strange a hug and be kind to each other.Do black people just believe any bs?

NASHVILLE, Tennessee – Country legend Loretta Lynch, best known for her his song The Coal Miner’s Daughter, says she is “sick to death” of getting hate mail, emails, and tweets aimed at former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.“I don’t know the woman, but Republicans apparently hate that bitch,” said Lynn, 84. “I get hundreds of emails and tweets each day, confusing me with her. I don’t know why. I sing music, she’s just some black attorney. I don’t see the connection.”Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who was appointed by Barack Obama, has never been liked by Republican voters, but has recently been in the news for Republican reports that she is tied to a Clinton scandal.This is not the first time that celebrities have been confused for one another. Rachel Roy was allegedly the woman referenced as having an affair with Beyonce’s husband, and many Beyonce fans attacked TV personality Rachel Ray via twitter. Adam Sandler often gets hate mail that should be directed at Gilbert Godfried, also. Although he reportedly also gets plenty of his own as well.

DECATUR, Alabama – Police were recently tipped off to a reported meth lab that was being run by Walmart employees in what they are calling one of the biggest busts in decades.Police Chief Robert Garner said that an anonymous tip was left on their drug hotline, expressing concern about a horrible burning smell that was coming from the back of the Decatur WalMart facility. When an officer was sent to investigate, the store was instantly shut down as he discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room.“The thing was massive, and contained enough materials to make hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds of crystal meth,” said Chief Garner. “Apparently, every employee in the store was a part of it, from working with and gathering materials, to cooking, to selling it outside of the store. It was a full, massive operation.”No one from Walmart’s corporate office was available for comment, but an unofficial spokesperson did say that they were “disappointed” that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down.

BEAUMONT, Texas –48-year old Henri Paul Johnson was killed last week after he was accidentally cremated during a long shift at the Coroner’s Office Morgue.According to police, Johnson took a nap on a stretcher after working over 16 hours, and was mistaken for another man who was killed in a car accident, and scheduled to be cremated.Jena Davis, who was not the co-worker who cremated Johnson, says they heard him scream for a moment, but didn’t know where the sound was coming from.“At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realized what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.”Davis says that Johnson was exposed to temperatures of well over 1500 degrees Fahrenheit, and there was nothing that could have been done. A new employee, who had forgotten to check the toe tag on the body before proceeding, was blamed for the accident, but no charges have yet been filed.

ST. LOUIS, Missouri – Chuck Berry, the man that many people say originated modern rock ‘n’ roll music, was reported as having passed away at the age of 90 by mainstream media, and the topic was trending on Facebook and other social media sites by mid-day Saturday. As it turns out, though, the reports were false.“Chuck is still alive and kicking, albeit with a lot less force than a few years ago,” said a friend of Berry’s, Marvin Richardson. “I was just hanging out with him last night. He played a few licks on the guitar for me, and he got a good laugh out of the fact that everyone thought he was dead. He said he was only taking a nap!”Berry, who has a career that spans over 60 years, is the latest in what some people would refer to as a “death hoax,” but in this case, it seems that Berry is in good spirits about it and doesn’t think it was a traditional hoax.“I don’t think anyone said I had died on purpose to fool people,” said Berry. “I think that my family, my friends, and even my doctors really thought I was dead. I do sleep really, really soundly, and sometimes I think my heart may actually be stopping. I guess this just confirms it.”Berry will perform his 300th concert at Blueberry Hill next month, assuming he hasn’t died for real by that point.

HOUSTON, Texas – A representative for the Atlanta Falcons says that the team has made an official complaint with the NFL, stating that the New England Patriots cheated during the second half of the Super Bowl, causing the Falcons to lose.In official documents signed by Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank and endorsed by head coach Dan Quinn, the team alleges that the New England Patriots cheated by having, “huge, over-inflated balls.”“During the first half of the game, the Patriots clearly were using their normal balls. Hell, they might have been using slightly under-inflated balls, honestly,” said coach Dan Quinn. “I don’t know exactly what happened after the 3rd quarter, but when they came back out on the field, that team was definitely playing with an entirely new set of balls – and their balls were huge, and way larger than before.”The NFL is not taking the accusation lightly, as the Patriots have known to play with their balls on previous occasions, with team quarterback and GOAT Tom Brady even being suspended for several games for knowingly playing with deflated balls.“We are looking at the Patriots balls very closely, as we cannot and will not take any accusation lightly of the Patriots playing with either small or large balls,” said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. “I have personally taken up the task of looking at Tom Brady’s balls, and will report my findings at a later conference.In the mean time, football fans across New England are overjoyed at their team bringing home their 5th Super Bowl win.“It’s a great time to be alive,” said Patriots Super Fan Mark Chilsom. “I don’t care a lick about balls, to be honest. That was the greatest game I’ve ever seen played, with a record-setting comeback. If it was because Tom Brady and the team came out to play with huge balls in the 4th, well the so be it.”

SAN FRANCISCO, California – NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has taken a lot of heat this week after he didn’t stand for the National Anthem, claiming he was making a point about African-American struggles in the country. Now, though, Kaepernick is taking it a step further, saying that he plans to never stand again.“It’s not going to be easy, and I fully know that,” said Kaepernick. “But the struggle is real for my black brothers, and so I’m going to do the world’s most intense sit-in. I’ll never stand up again if that’s what it takes for people to notice that African-Americans have it bad.”Many criticize Kaepernick because he doesn’t know anything about the struggle of black America – or white America, for that matter.“Yes, I am only half-black, and yes, I was adopted and raised by rich, white parents, but still, fuck whitey, and black power, or whatever,” he said. “Shit, all I know is that I’ll break my legs if it means I can sit down forever.”

MIAMI, Florida – College football team The Florida Gators has announced it will be changing its name following the death of a two-year-old boy who was grabbed and drowned by an alligator while vacationing with his family at the Disney World Resort in Florida.The alligator snatched the toddler as he played at the edge of the Seven Seas Lagoon, a manmade lake at the Walt Disney resort.The boy’s parents, who were relaxing on the white sand shore nearby, sprang into action in a failed attempt to pry their child from the predator’s grip. A lifeguard who was on duty was unable to reach the boy before the alligator swam away with him.Although the parents did not request the SEC Eastern Division champions change their name, the athletics department at the State University System of Florida says they have received a lot of public pressure. Coach Jim McElwain says he fears it may affect the team. “Personally, I think alligators get a bad rap. I’m worried a name change this close to start of the season is unrealistic and may affect team moral.”The team has not settled on a new name, but the Raging Retires and Orange Crushers has been proposed.

VALLEJO, California –World-famous competitive eater Joey “Jaws” Chestnut, a competitive eater who was currently ranked second in the world, has reportedly died from acute acid reflux, a disease he developed over a career of eating excessive amounts of food.“Joey was in incredible health for a person who consumed hundreds of thousands of calories as if it was his job,” said Dr. Emmett Brown. “Unfortunately, despite his good health and the calories not causing him to be massively overweight, the one thing he could not get past was his horrible case of acid reflux disease, which he contracted after a particularly difficult challenge of eating the World’s Hottest Hot Wings in 2011.”Joey Chestnut had competed, and won, the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Challenge multiple years, as well as many other challenges, including hot wings, meatballs, pizza, and an entire turkey dinner.“Joey was a God to me,” said up-and-coming competitive eater Kimball Rowell. “I competed against him once in a pizza eating contest, and I ate 4 slices in 2 minutes. He ate 3 full pizzas. The man is a legend, and his legacy will last a lifetime.”Chestnut was scheduled to compete this summer at the Nathan’s Hot Dog contest once again, where he hoped to regain his title as world champion.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Donald Trump has made plans to officially move the White House from Washington, D.C. to Las Vegas, where he owns property and says that the taxes are “much more manageable.”“Moving the White House to Las Vegas will save tax payers an estimated $20 million a year, as the land values are much lower in the desert,” said Trump. “I am working with the best planners, the best men out there, to move the White House safely and securely.”There is no word on whether Las Vegas will become our nation’s capital after the White House is relocated, but Trump did say that he wouldn’t personally have any problem with that.“There’s a lot of money in Las Vegas, and a lot of beautiful women. We’d be lucky to have Las Vegas be our nation’s capital. It’s a beautiful, fun, fast-paced city, and everyone who goes there loves it. I love it. I own plenty of property there. It’s great. Plus, what happens there stays there, so we could get away with a lot more there than we could here in D.C.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – After a slew of celebrity devices were hacked, a group of anonymous individuals have begun leaking nude images and sex tapes recorded by the celebrity victims. The latest seems to be President Donald Trump himself, as the group of hackers claims they have a sex tape that was taken “very recently,” but does not feature Trump’s wife Melania.“We have procured a very salacious, very non-sexy video,” posted an anonymous hacker on the forum Reddit. “I’ve seen the video myself. I wish I hadn’t, but I have. And the person in the video is definitely Trump, and the other person is decidedly NOT Melania.”According to the post, which included screenshots that we are not able to re-post here, the group would be releasing the full video if Trump did not step down from the Presidency. Although most would assume that he would never do that just to save face, the poster seems to think that the video is definitely something that will “get Trump thinking.”“President Trump will know exactly what video we have if we mention the words ‘donkey’ and ‘whips,'” said the post. “We do not think that Trump, nor the man in the video with him, would want this information going public. Whoops, guess I slipped up there…”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was hospitalized after he contracted what he said was “bird flu” from eating a bucket of KFC chicken that had spoiled.According to his doctor, Spicer merely had a case of the trots after ingesting day-old chicken, but the Press Secretary is “positive” that it is Bird Flu.“I ate bad chicken, which is a bird. Everyone knows that chickens are birds,” said Spicer from his hospital bed. “When you eat bad birds, you get bird flu. I don’t know why that is so hard for these doctors to understand.”Spicer says that he has contracted bird flu several times in his life, and that his mom was always the best at making him feel better when he was a boy.“Mom would make me a hot broth and I’d eat that with crackers, and then I’d lay down and I felt better,” said Spicer. “It has happened several times, but not in many years. Mom also helped me after I contracted mad cow disease after I ate spoiled hamburger one time. My mom is a phenomenal woman.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Trump announced this morning that he would be taking a 2-month vacation beginning April 1st, returning to Washington in June, after a “stressful” first quarter of 2017.“There are a lot of things that have come across my desk, and it’s been overwhelming,” said Trump. “I think that it will be a good time to take a break, and let things really setting in my head so I can continue Making America Great Again.”Trump owns a home in the Bahamas, but will be renting a massive villa instead of using the home he owns.“I want to see new parts of the area, and so I will be renting some property for the two months I’m gone. This will only put a minor burden on tax payers, as it will fall under Presidential Service.”President Trump will be bringing his wife and son Barron, as well as 13 members of the Secret Service.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald Trump has rung the death toll for the Cable News Network. According to recently filed documents, the once mega-giant news channel will be losing their FCC licenses, forcing them to stop broadcast on April 1. The blow comes after Trump declared the company ‘fake news,’ and blacklisted them from attending White House press conferences.“CNN is the worst network on television today, and nothing they say about me is true,” said President Trump. “The only network worth watching is Fox News. They are true. They say true things, and they say the best things. CNN is the worst, and everything they say is fake news.”After Trump declared the channel to be fake news, their ratings plummeted to the lowest in cable television history, with only around 100 to 150 people even tuning into the channel on a daily basis.“We are saddened that Trump has chosen our network to the be the scapegoat for his War on Truth,” said CNN head Carl Nelson. “Because of his lies about our network, we have lost our licenses, and lost our ability to broadcast. Effective April 1st, we will no longer be on the air.”Nelson says they are trying to convince the FCC that they should be allowed to continue broadcasting, but the FCC says that they are “not interested” in listening to any fake news, either.“President Trump has informed us that CNN should not be listened to, so we’re not going to,” said FCC chairman Joel Winters. “We’re a government agency. We do what we’re told. I’m not losing my job over this shit.”

DENVER, Colorado – The Girls Scouts of America have officially been given the ‘green light’ to begin selling marijuana edible cookies in states where the drug has been legalized. Starting in April of 2017, Girl Scout troupes in Maine, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Washington D.C., among others, will be able to sell edibles.“Our cookies have long been a favorite of stoners nationwide,” said Girl Scouts of America president Jane Marshall. “With the legalization of recreational marijuana in several states, we decided it was time to really open ourselves up to the marijuana community. That is why we created two new products to be sold in legalized states.”Marshall says that they will be creating Samosas and Thin Mints, their top-selling cookies, that are infused with the marijuana plant.“These cookies will be made available only to adults, aged 21 or older, and they will only be available for purchase through the parents of a Girl Scout troupe. The children themselves will not be able to sell or consume these cookies,” said Marshall. “We are very happy with how these cookies have come out, and we think they will be a huge boost to the fundraising these girls do every year.”Yearly sales of Girl Scout Cookies total approximately $700 million. This year, the plan is to surpass the $1 billion mark.

BENTONVILLE, Arkansas – Although many people consider Walmart to be the epitome of an “evil corporation,” no one can say that they’re not completely in touch with what people want. The company announced today that in several states, including Colorado, Maine, and Washington D.C., the company would begin selling marijuana seeds and seedling plants to consumers who are over 21.“Most of these states have the same or similar laws when it comes to owning marijuana plants,” said company spokesperson Rebecca Brent. “As an adult over 21, you can have several plants, and you can grow even more. We already sell alcohol, and our employees are trained to ask for ID for anyone under 40 for controlled substances. Heck, we even card for R-rated movies like some company out of the dark ages. So selling marijuana will not add any sort of hinderance on our employees, and will be a great way to tap into a new market of potential customers.”Surprisingly, there are very few protests about the company dipping into the weed trade, even from government officials.“If Walmart is adhering to the laws, gaining proper licensure, then there’s no reason I can see for any fuss to be made,” said Charlie Connors, a representative for the Governor’s office in Maine. “We are allowing small businesses to sell, and we are allowing adults to purchase. I do not see why there is any issue with Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, from selling either.”Brent says that if the seed and seedling sales go well, it’s possible that Walmart will branch into smaller locations that will only sell marijuana and paraphernalia.“We were thinking of calling those smaller stores Wal-Greens, but as it turns out, that’s pretty much taken,” said Brent. “We are really excited about moving forward with such a great product launch, though.”Brent says that they will add new aisles into Walmart locations that will be selling. The marijuana products will be located, naturally, next to the potato chip and soda aisle.

STAMFORD, CT – WWE Chairman Vince McMahon announced today that he has tapped President Donald Trump to appear at Wrestlemania 33 in Orlando, Florida on April 2nd.Trump, who had a long story arch in the WWE in the 90s and was entered into the WWE Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2013, says that he is “extremely excited” to get back in the ring.“It was one of the best times of my life, attacking Vince McMahon and appearing on their Pay-Per-View events,” said Trump. “Vince and I, we’ve been friends a long time. Rivals in the world of business, but friends all the same. When he asked me to return, I wasn’t sure it was the best thing to do, because I’ve got a lot going on right now, but this is a yuge opportunity and will be a lot of fun for me, and hopefully for the Wrestlemania crowd in Orlando. I have no problem taking a steel chair to the face, as long as that chair was made by the United Steel Workers Union here in the great country I call home – the United States of America.”“We are very excited that Donnie will be coming back in,” said McMahon in a press release posted to WWE.com. “He has always been a friend to this company, to the wrestling world, to the world of Sports Entertainment, and as an honored member of the Hall of Fame, we are very excited to have him appear at Wrestlemania 33.”Neither McMahon nor Trump have indicated in what capacity the latter would be appearing, but McMahon did drop a hint that he hoped Trump wouldn’t have any problem getting color.

LOS ANGELES, California – Doctor Carl Jung, a gastroenterologist working in Los Angeles, California, has said he has developed the world’s most perfect, and most expensive, colon cleanse for his patients who need to “get the pipes working again.”Dr. Jung has been treating certain patients using the “blood of the innocent,” which he harvests from a doctor friend that performs abortions at a local Planned Parenthood facility.“My procedure is one-of-a-kind that I developed myself while studying in Uganda in 1983,” said Dr. Jung. “It works better than any other anal douche you could get, and it’s all because of the massive white blood cell count found in aborted fetuses. This is not a magic pill you take to cleanse your body – this is a true, liquid cavity expulsion.”Dr. Jung says that he has been procuring dead babies for “over 30 years” from a friend, who says wishes to remain anonymous. Several celebrities, including Martha Stewart, Barack Obama, and Paul McCartney have all said to have visited Dr. Jung for the treatment, which costs a whopping $289,000 per session.“They love it, and they keep coming back,” said Dr. Jung. “As anyone would tell you, there’s no better way to cleanse that ass than with the blood of the innocent.”

UGANDA – A woman living in a village in Uganda has been confirmed to be over 200-years-old by genealogists, researchers, and archivists who have looked into the woman’s lineage.The woman, who does not remember her own name, is officially the oldest person to have ever lived. She was born in the same village in Uganda she currently lives, and says she has “never left.”“I have lived long, I am tired. I have never gone away, this is what I know,” she said. “I am happy to be here. I am not happy to be so old. Wish I was dead. All my family, they are dead. I have had 18 children, 47 grandchildren, and 163 great-grandchildren, and they are all gone now. I’m sad. Kill me, please.”Researchers say that they have “no idea” how it’s possible that she has lived so long, but have confirmed through genetic testing that she is, indeed, 204-years-old, having been born in 1806.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –The “Finger-Chop Challenge” has begun to spread across social media, with teens and college students reportedly cutting off their fingers in an effort to raise awareness about the “evils of Donald Trump” as President.“Trump is a disgusting, sick, orange bigot,” said Maria Lambert, 19, a college sophomore at Dartmouth. “I chopped off all of my  fingers on a livestream on Facebook. I left just the middle finger on one hand, because fuck Trump, that’s why.”Following in a dangerous trend of challenges like the cinnamon or milk gallon challenges, the new finger-chop challenge opens up an entire new world of issues for parents, as well as the teens stooping to such ignorant levels.“My son has done the challenge 4 times, and each time, he’s cut off a new finger. He’s down to just the pinky on his left hand,” said Carl Lunger of his son, Mario Lunger, 17. “Frankly, though, I’m proud of him. He’s taking a stand against Trump, and he’s also raised a lot of awareness about Trump. Last I knew, he had over 300 views on his YouTube video.”Health officials are warning parents, though, of the dangers of their children cutting off their own fingers for internet notoriety.

BOSTON, Massachusetts – Researchers at Boston Medical Center are planning to release a new study that proves that all cancers – even some of the most rare and previously un-treatable cancers such as brain or lymph node – can be easily cured with one ‘extremely common’ item.“We have been working on a cure for Cancer for as long as we’ve known about the disease, and we have finally found the answer,” said Dr. Phil Brooks. “Really the cure was right there under our noses, as it were, the entire time.”Dr. Brooks says that he and his team all developed a severe cocaine habit during the testing phase, as the long nights and early days were making it extremely hard to stay awake and concentrate.“It was then we realized, after a night of doing copious amounts of blow, that we had the bright idea to test the drug on our lab rats. Within a month, all of the animals that we had given cancer were cured,” said Dr. Brooks. “We moved on a few months later to trials in adult humans.”Of the 2,000 people that the doctors test the cocaine theory on, every single one of them had their cancer disappear within a few weeks, or sooner in cases of “common cancers” like skin or colon.“It’s miraculous, truly,” said Dr. Brooks.The team plan to publish their full study in the next Journal of Bizarre Medicine.

BOSTON, Massachusetts – A new study conducted by Harvard University shows that teens who “vape” are more likely to be made fun of than kids who do not. The study was performed over the last year, and monitored a group of 200 teens aged 15 to 19.“Of the group, 100 of the kids were vapers, or kids who smoke using vape pens, etc.,” said that study chairman, Mick Horn. “Those kids were asked to vape in front of the other 100 kids, who proceeded, of course, to call the vape kids a slew of names, including ‘faggot,’ ‘tool,’ ‘loser,’ and ‘asshole,’ among others. When the study was flipped, the vape kids really had nothing to say about the non-vapers.”According to his findings, Horn says that kids should decidedly not take up vaping, unless they like being made fun of.“There’s really no point to vaping, short of smoking while looking like an extra douche bag,” said Horn. “I think that my study conclusively proves that.”

UNITED STATES – After it was confirmed that Russia easily hacked computers in the United States to rig the 2016 elections, the FBI is warning that it’s “very likely” that Russian hackers and spies are probably in your computer right now, looking at your files.“There are many things that you can do to protect yourself from Russian hackers,” said FBI director J. Hoover Edgar. “For one, you want to make sure you put a piece of tape of your computer’s camera. That’s just something simple that every idiot knows to do by now. Another thing you can do is to get offline completely when not using the computer. Just unplug and turn off your machine, and you should probably unplug your router, too, just to be safe.”Edgar also recommends writing most of your documents in Aramaic, the dead language spoken by Jesus Christ and his disciples.“It’s very hard for Russians to read Aramaic, because most people don’t know it. If you learn it now, you will have a much better chance of your files not being read by Russian hackers,” said Edgar.According to the FBI, the one thing that can almost certainly defeat a hacker, though, is to make sure you change your passwords 10 to 15 times a day, for all of your website logins, especially banks and social media accounts.“If you leave your password as the same thing for more than a couple of minutes, you’re basically giving full access to your life,” said Edgar. “Change your passwords multiple times a day. It really keeps the ol’ Ruskies on their toes.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Researchers at the Washington, D.C. House of Agriculture and Animal Affairs say that they expect Pandas will become extinct within the next few months, probably by June of 2017.“We actually had no idea that pandas were really that rare, because we see pictures of them online all the time,” said HAAA chairman Joel Bornstein. “We thought they were doing pretty good out in the wild, but apparently not. There’s only a couple left.”The HAAA says they are trying “really hard” to get a couple of pandas to “do their thing” and make some more panda babies, but they’re having a really hard time.“We got two of the 17 pandas left in the world, and we have been doing everything to get them to have sexy time, but it’s just not working,” said Bornstein. “We’ve tried calming music, chocolates, wine…we even let them watch porn. Nothing has worked.”The HAAA says that they hope that they can save the population of pandas before it’s too late, but they don’t hold out much hope.

CONCORD, New Hampshire – Chester Miller, who has been studying the effects of global warming for nearly 20 years, says that he has finally found conclusive proof that the phenomenon is completely and totally bogus.“I have been looking into the effects of global warming, and can conclusively say that the world is not warmer at all,” said Miller. “I had been waiting and waiting for this discovery, and it came to me earlier this week. It was a true moment of glory for all of science.”Miller says that during the night between Thursday and Friday, his town of Concord, New Hampshire received a massive amount of snow – over a foot in just a few hours. This, he says, is proof that the world is not getting warmer.“If global warming were real, then how come we got 14″ of snow the other night?” asked Miller. “I assume you all understand that in order for it to snow, it has to be cold. And in order for it to snow THAT MUCH in that amount of time, well – it has to be very cold. I believe I can rest my case.”

BAZOS, Croatia – A team of explorers who have been searching for the lost city of Atlantis for the better part of 30 years have reportedly discovered the ruins of the Mecca, located approximately 30 miles beneath the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, directly off the coast of Croatia.According to the research team, there is more than $300 billion worth of lost treasures within the city, not to mention the city itself.“People have been searching for Atlantis for hundreds of years, with many thinking that it may never have existed at all,” said Mark Kempf, lead of the expedition. “Through hundreds of hours of research in books before setting out on our trip, we were able to locate the approximate area where we believed the city to be, and after repeated attempts to reach the area, we were finally successful last week.”Kempf says that it will become “increasingly difficult” to have many people visit the area, as he believes the more people that know the area, the fewer treasures there will be.“Oh, the place will definitely be overrun with pirates very quickly, which is why we are not releasing the city’s exact location at this time,” said Kempf. “This discovery will definitely put my children’s children’s children through college, though.”

MOBILE, Alabama —With gay marriage now legal in all 50 states and rainbow flags (the universal symbol for gay pride) flying all over the country, one man who makes it a point to destroy every rainbow flag and spray paint over rainbow bumper stickers he sees, now wants to destroy actual rainbows.“I used to like seeing a rainbow in nature, ” Buddy Jones told Confederate News. “Now all I see is a symbol for faggotry. Makes me sick to my tummy to see a rainbow in the sky. I want to destroy them because they’re making me crazy and I think destroying rainbows will really get on queer’s nerves, but I don’t know how to kill rainbows myself.”That’s where Jones wants scientists to step in and help.“I know a lot of scientists are fag sympathizers,” Jones said. “But there are some good Christian scientists out there who could use their scientific smarts to destroy rainbows. Scientists can build talking robots and send people into deep space, how hard could it be to destroy rainbows?”Jones is calling out scientists to take up his rainbow destroying cause.“Maybe scientists could build a laser gun that instantly blows up rainbows,” Jones said. ‘I don’t know. I just think this is an important cause. Queers took rainbows from us and made them their own, now we gotta show them there are consequences to what they did. And think about this: How long before some other sicko group takes something cool from nature? Like clouds or something. We gotta destroy rainbows now.”

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil – Analysts fear tensions with the Russians could lead to another war if the Russians are banned from participating in the Olympic games. The Russian sports minister says “up to 67 athletes” have applied to track and field’s world governing body to be exempted from the ban on the Russian team at the Rio de Janeiro OlympicsThe IAAF is unlikely to approve most of the 67 athletes, since it has previously indicated the exemption is aimed at a small minority of athletes based abroad.When a global governing body for sports barred Russia’s track and field team from the 2016 Summer Olympics on Friday over a wide-ranging doping scandal, it was greeted in Russia, as is with a deep sense of victimhood.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called the decision “unjust, of course.”Mr. Putin said, “Russia is strengthening antidoping controls and athletes should bear personal responsibility for using performance-enhancing drugs.” Punishing the whole team, he said, “doesn’t fit any norms of civilized behavior.”Outside Russia, sporting officials viewed the unanimous decision as a long overdue restoration of some fairness in competitions. After all, in some sporting events Russian athletes had been trouncing competitors for years before it turned out they were using performance-enhancing drugs.

BRUSSELS, Belgium – Social media has been abuzz the last few weeks with the hashtag #SaferThanATrumpRally, with many folks listing some absurd and dark places that are safer to be than at a Donald Trump rally.After the attack in Brussels, Belgium, most would assume that they’d rather be anywhere else, but according to social media, even the terrorist-attacked city would be a better place to be than with any view of Donald Trump.“I’d rather be in Brussels with a shirt with a target on it that says ‘fuck you, Muslim scum’ than ever set foot at a Trump rally,” said New York resident Joel Miller. “I was downtown during 9/11. Scariest time of my life. I’d rather live that all over again, too, than ever be at a Trump rally. The man, and his minions, are mindless, soulless villains.”As with all tragedies, everyone is standing with Brussels, and an onslaught of support has appeared from all corners of the globe, with many users on social media changing their pictures to a photo of the flag of Belgium in solidarity.“Donald Trump is a nightmare. I’ve seen people get punched in the face while simply standing still, peacefully, at one of his rallys,” said Maryanne Lewis of Detroit, Michigan. “I’d sooner throw beer and ham at a Muslim holding an AK-47 with TNT strapped to his ass than be at a Trump rally. These are terrifying times, both in the US and abroad.”

Dear Allison,
It was my 21st birthday a couple days ago. The ONLY thing I asked my Nana for was a pair of diamond earrings. I don’t know how I should feel because I found out they are cubic zirconium.  My stepmother pointed it out yesterday, and thinking about it, I cried on the way to work.  I don’t know if I should say something. I don’t want to sound like a spoiled brat, but it was the only thing I asked for. Should I mention it? I really want to say something.-Faked OutDear Faked,
Aww, poor you. Too late, you already sound like a spoiled brat. 21? Nana is wise enough to know you’ll lose an earring during one of your many drunk night – most likely while you’re going down on a stranger with an STD who picked you up while you were blacked out at the bar. What are you, a rich bitch?  It’s time to grow up and realize Nana’s bank account doesn’t revolve around you. Whatever your job is, it isn’t hard enough.  You should try mining your own diamond for a bowl of gruel a day.
But then again, I’m not really the person to ask since my own mother would’ve slapped me if I had the balls to ask for diamonds.  Maybe you should buy yourself a bunch of booze and get the courage to call your Nana. I’m sure if you whine enough she’ll get you a much better present next year.
Dear Allison,
I am torn between my 16 year-old daughter, “Uniquea” and my bae, “Tyrone”.  My fiancé got me a stuffed monkey for my birthday a couple weeks ago.  Wellllllll…afterwards we got in a fight, and he wanted it back. I told him no, cuz he gave that to me.  Anyway, he comes over to get it, and we got in another altercation over it.  After we had it out, he apologized and started kissin’ up on me. My daughter screamed, she sick of him hustlin’ me and after kissin’ on me like it was a’ight. Then she took his Ray-Bans and ran in the other room. I screamed at her to give ‘em back, but she twisted them ‘till they was broke beyond repair. Tyrone insists Uniquea needa pay for them out of her hair/nail allowance, but I say Tyrone shouldn’t of been over here provokin’ in the first place. Should I side with my man or my daughter?-Hassled at HomeDear Hassled,
Your fiancé sounds like quite the catch.  I bet the moment you don’t put out, he demands you give him all those cheesy “I Luv You” Valentine’s teddy bears that line your headboard. Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter what you do. You’re screwed.  You’re daughter’s screwed.  It doesn’t matter if Tyrone is in your life because you’re all cursed to live an ignorant, drama-filled existence, regardless.  Continue modeling that kind of behavior and just pray Uniquea’s first baby isn’t doesn’t end up with as God-awful a name as she did and that her baby-daddy actually pays child support. You can email your questions for a future column to AskAllisonAnything@gmail.com. Go Ask Allison‘s weekly column is published weekly exclusively by Empire News.

DEAR ALLISON,How do I know if the man I married is really “the one?” My husband and I have been married for 2 years. He does everything for me. He works three jobs so I can stay home and build my small business. He cooks, and cleans. He’s fantastic in bed. We are doing really well…but there is something that’s just missing. What if I made a mistake?– CONCERNED in CALIFORNIADear Concerned,The man sounds like a saint. To be honest, I don’t think he probably is the one for you. If anything, he sounds like the one for me. After the string of losers I’ve been with, I could use a man who knows how to cook, how to clean, and how to do me right. Tell you what, Concerned – you let him go. If he comes back, then he’s “the one.” If you find him in my bed, then it looks like he was the one, but you’re too stupid to have known it. You’re living every woman’s dream, and you’re thinking it might have been a mistake? You must be a lesbian.
DEAR ALLISON,For my 18th birthday my boyfriend got me a tattoo, but I didn’t tell my parents. I still live at home, and my Dad will FREAK OUT if he knows that I got “Chris Forever” tattooed on my thigh. How do I tell my parents that I got inked?– TATTED in TALLAHASSEDear Tatted,First off, the fact that you’re barely 18 and you got your boyfriend’s name tattooed on you already screams how dumb you are. There are people who have been married decades who don’t do stupid things like that. My suggestion would be to tell your parents as soon as possible, and hope they forgive you enough to help pay to have it lasered off. The only name you should put on your body is your child’s. Hell, you shouldn’t even put that. Get a damn flower or a heart like every other teenage idiot out there, and call it a day. Since I got this letter 2 weeks ago, I’d assume that Chris has already left you for some other bimbo. Now you get to spend the rest of your life dating only men named Chris, or else they’re going to go limp as soon as you take your pants off.
DEAR ALLISON,My mother is a die-hard Christian, and on more than one occasion has made it quite known to me, my family, and everyone else who will listen that she hates gay people, and thinks they are an abomination. I’m 23 now, and I’m afraid to come out of the closet for fear I will lose my mother’s love. What do I do?-IN THE CLOSET in INDIANAPOLISDear Closet,Man up, my gay friend. If your mother is such a bigot that she would disown her child because of their sexual orientation, than you don’t need her! Find a new mom. Find a mate, and have their mom be your new mom! There are plenty of people out there who will accept you for who you are. It will probably be hard at first to tell your mother, but if she can’t handle it, then how is she going to handle when you find a mate? Get married? Adopt children? In my opinion, your mother needs to grow the hell up and deal. It’s 2014 for crying out loud. How much longer are we going to have to deal with these conservative bigots? Listen, you tell your mom that she’s going to have to accept you, or you smack that bitch in the face. No two ways about it. Good luck! You can email your questions for a future column to AskAllisonAnything@gmail.com. Go Ask Allison‘s weekly column is published every Monday exclusively by Empire News.

DEAR ALLISON,Sometimes I think my step-mother really holds me back from having any fun. If I ask her if it’s okay to go to movies with friends, she won’t let me unless I do something for her, like the dishes or mow the lawn or any number of other household chores. I am the only one that she makes do this – my two step-brothers and my step-sister get to go out and do whatever they want. Why does she make me do things but they never have to?-CRYING in COLORADODear Crying,You don’t have to be such a crybaby, you know. Just do the damn dishes, and then you can go hang out with friends or go to the movies. Your step-mother is letting her kids do things without “paying her” for them because they are the fruit of her loins. Since you were ejected from some other woman’s lovehole, she’s more than likely making you pay for it. No step-mother has ever liked her step-children. Haven’t you ever seen Cinderella? Your best bet is to hurry up and turn 18, so you can tell her exactly where to go, and exactly how to get there.DEAR ALLISON,I hate it when people spoil the endings of my favorite TV shows or movies I haven’t seen on social media. Simple question, but how do I get people to stop talking about things before I see them?!-UGH in UTAHDear Ugh,First, let me congratulate you on coming up with the worst damn pseudonym that I’ve ever seen. “Ugh?” Oh God, you must be 12. Anyway, this might come as a surprise to you, but you could, you know, get the hell off the internet once in a while. You could also stop worrying about TV and movies getting spoiled for you, because they’re just entertainment, and if knowing who died on last night’s episode of Game of Thrones before you’ve had a chance to watch it is ruining your life, I think you’re going to have much, much bigger problems in life the older you get. Good luck in life, Ugh. You’re definitely going to need it.DEAR ALLISON,I got married last week, and my mother-in-law got completely hammered drunk at the wedding. Long story short, she ended up hitting on my still-very-married father. It made my mother extremely upset, and now my husband’s family and my family will have nothing to do with each other. What can I do to reconcile this whole ordeal?
-TOASTED in TULSADear Toasted,Who cares if your families can’t get along? Do they really have to have anything to do with each other? My husband hasn’t spoken to my side of the family since the wedding four years ago, and he’s never been happier. In case you didn’t know this, in-laws have never gotten along with their son or daughter’s significant other. Or you could play it the complete opposite way and try and get your parents divorced so you can hook up your father and mother-in-law. It could be one big, happy family. It’s really your call. Either way, people do stupid things when drunk. If your mother doesn’t know that, she must be a complete and total stick in the ass…or mud. Whatever floats your boat. You can email your questions for a future column to AskAllisonAnything@gmail.com. Go Ask Allison‘s weekly column is published every Monday exclusively by Empire News.

DEAR ALLISON,
My boyfriend of 4 years and I have been seeing each other less and less lately, as I recently started a new job. When I come home to him at night, he seems withdrawn and doesn’t enjoy having…well, we’re not as intimate as we used to be. He’s not working and I pay all the bills, so I don’t think he’s stressed out or anything. I don’t want to be that bitchy girlfriend who goes through his Facebook or his phone to see if he’s been talking to other girls, but I think he might be cheating. Should I confront him, or go about finding out another way?– SUSPICIOUS in SACRAMENTODear Suspicious,Of course he’s cheating on you. The only thing a man wants more than a good steak is a good ol’ fashioned. If you are coming home from a long day at work, and he’s been lounging around all day and it’s him that doesn’t want you, there really is no other explanation. I’d suggest that you “be that bitchy girlfriend” and go through his phone or Facebook. You don’t want to confront him, because what’s the point? Is he just going to say “oh, you’re right, dear, I’m cheating.”? No, he’s going to deny it. Your best course of action is to wait until he’s asleep and smell his penis. It sounds crude, but everyone knows men rarely wash themselves period, and the odds of him showering after having his mistress over is zero. Definitely sniff that shaft, and you’ll have all the evidence you need. DEAR ALLISON,My girlfriend of two years is lazy and doesn’t wanna do anything for me. In my circle, the other girlfriends will make food for the game, and then go off and do their own thing, but they always come out to see if we need more beer or snacks, you know? My girlfriend doesn’t do those things, and it’s embarassing. My bros, they give me crap about how lazy she is.  When we watch the game at my house, she doesn’t wanna cook, and then she sits around, trying to talk through the game. Like we’re interested in listening to her long, boring stories about shoes? The other day I was checking out my buddy’s girlfriend’s ass as she bent over to pick up our beer cans, and I thought – “that’s what I deserve.”  I’m wondering if I should break up with her because this isn’t working, and it’s not like I don’t have other options. – FED-UP in FREEPORTDear FED-UP,Start packing her bags right now – I can’t believe you’ve dealt with her for two years! By this point she should definitely know her place. If she isn’t going to make you a sandwich and sit quietly during the game, or let you go out with your bros without nagging, then she isn’t the one. Look at your buddies; sounds like they’ve got their women trained perfectly! There are plenty of girls out there who have learned their lessons, so just choose one of the dumb sluts you’re probably already flirting with, and plug her hard. After you’ve gotten your ex out of the way, make sure you tell the new girl how much you love the cheese dip your buddy’s girlfriend always brings over, and set the expectation that that’s what you expect out of your woman. Out of desperation to please you, she’ll learn to jump right up at the sound of a crushed beer can, or you can tell her where to go, too. DEAR ALLISON,I hate my mother. She has the mentality of an extremely spoiled teenager in the body of an overweight, pushy fifty year-old troll. She is in complete denial about all the abuse she put me through when I was growing up. She says that everything bad in her life is my fault, and she’s posted nasty stuff to my Facebook wall, like telling me that she wishes I was never born. It’s got so bad that I had to block her. She still continues to spread rumors to my friends and family, saying that I pawned her jewelry for drugs or that I’ve prostituted myself for spare change. These lies hurt, because my family and friends are now ostracizing me. I’ve never even had sex, and she knows it! Every time we talk, it’s a blow out. Should I try to reconcile with her, or should I just move on with my life?-MISERABLE in MALIBUDEAR MISERABLE,Judging by your letter, I’d say you and your mother have more in common than you think! You must be extremely spoiled yourself. Here you are calling your mother nasty things in a massive public setting, just like you say she’s done to you! Way more people will see your letter here, calling your mother a fat troll, than the minimal amount of friends and family members who she no doubt has on her Facebook page. How do you think she’s going to feel when she sees your letter here? Yeah, probably the same way you felt when she called you a little whore. Your family probably doesn’t want to talk to you anymore because you’re the worst kind of bitch – the kind who blames everyone else around her for her own shortcomings. Plus, they probably know you’ll steal their valuables for drug money next! Go to counseling with your mother. You both sound like a couple of nut jobs. You can email your questions for a future column to AskAllisonAnything@gmail.com.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Vice President Mike Pence reportedly electrocuted himself accidentally after touching a light switch after getting out of the shower, while still wet. Ironically, the VP now claims that he is homosexual, and has planned a massive “coming out” party at the White House.Pence, who has long been known for his completely stupid views on homosexuality and believing that it can be cured via electro-shock therapy, is now referring to himself as “a big, flaming fag,” and says he’s never been happier.“Oh my God you guys, being gay is so wonderful and amazing. I mean, I wanna say I told you so, ’cause if I’m gay just from getting shocked, there’s no WAY that shocking couldn’t cause the opposite effect, ya know?” said Pence in a fun, sing-song voice. “But, you know, I’m just too damn giddy to even consider being negative like that. I’m the first gay man in power since Elton John’s Tiny Dancer was #1 on the charts. Ohh, baby!”The gay community, which is normally very happy when a major celebrity comes out, has withdrawn from Pence’s announcement, and calls it “truly stupid.”

Eight years ago, this writer walked into rehearsal for one of the most prestigious symphony choruses in the country.  At the time, I was a second soprano in that group (I actually have a higher voice than most of the firsts, but kept ending up at second) and one of maybe five members out of 130 or so who were not enamored of Barack Obama.  Not at all.  After eight years, memory fades as to which venue we were using that night, the main hall or the alternative site, but what doesn’t fade was the jubilation in the voice of one of the other sopranos when the director said, “I know we’re all concerned about the election,” and the female lawyer holding court in the back row said, “It’s going well,” over the heads of everyone else.Joy and exuberance were in the air.  It wasn’t until the break, about an hour an a half into the three hour rehearsal, that the stage cleared so that the liberals could get on their iPhones and check the returns, that the handful of conservatives sat by ourselves out there.  The only other woman, a fellow soprano quite a bit younger than me, shook her head, and we looked at each other.  “They have no idea what they’ve just done,” we practically said in unison.  (The same scenario repeated itself four years later with another person.)Eight years hence, the tables have turned.  And after eight years of keeping our mouths shut just to maintain friendships and professional relationships from which people in the arts – particularly those of us who are not union – gain gigs and connections, the conservatives among us still can’t fully come out of the closet.  The reason why was put on display Friday evening in New York.  (At this point, everyone out there knows what happened when Vice President-elect Mike Pence went to see Hamilton on Broadway. Not going to rehash it.)You see, we conservatives dare to be diverse in OPINION from the prevailing political paradigm in the arts: flat out liberalism as preached by the mainstream media.  And THAT is barely tolerated.  In fact, most of these people who are vehemently anti-church unless it’s for convenience or what we call a “church job” (section leader in a choir), feminist, pro-choice, open borders, and all that jazz, always assume the person they are talking to agrees with them.  It is an anathema to them that conservatives could possibly be in their midst.In the fourteen or so days since Donald Trump has been elected president, things like this have been appearing in my Facebook feed from my friend the lawyer from the back row of sopranos.She’s actually one of the more tolerant of the lot, but still…she’s caught in the NPR echo chamber.  In response, this writer posted this on Facebook.I’ll get to Antonio Vivaldi, a priest who had to give up being one for health reasons, teaching orphaned girls music so they could make a living later.  And the Belgian Jesuit who first posited the Big Bang Theory.  And Albertus Magnus who brought chemistry out of the age of alchemy.  We call him St. Albert the Great (he was a Dominican friar).This is honestly the thought paradigm of the truly privileged people in the arts, which is what makes Friday’s display of hubris from the Broadway cast of “Hamilton” so disgusting.  Larry O’Connor at HotAir puts it in perspective:My phone starting buzzing in the early hours Saturday morning as news of the “curtain-speech-heard-round-the-world” hit everyone’s Facebook page. Friends of mine who work on Broadway were sending me their personal opinions because they “could never say it out loud” and they were counting on me to speak on their behalf.I heard from an actor who pointed out that the performers on stage are in the most prominent position of privilege the industry could ever provide an actor. They appear in the hottest play in the country and have a steady Actor’s Equity contract with full benefits along with a job for the next decade, if they want it.The idea that these well-paid thespians represent “the diverse America” that is concerned with the direction of the country is absurd, this actor said. They represent the elite not just in this country, but in their own industry. It wasn’t lost on this actor friend of mine that these cast members live a far better lifestyle than the Americans they claim to represent.Another friend, an actor of color, regretted the message sent to any Republican or non-liberal who heard about this story over the weekend. The man came to the THEATRE with an obviously open mind and they chose to reject the gesture this friend said to me. “And you’re for tolerance and diversity?” the actor lamented.And that is where this writer’s experience with members of the chorus, a professional group for which most of us volunteered, is essentially the same.  The people on the stage that night eight years ago, the ones mourning the loss of their Utopia now, are almost entirely highly educated professionals in white collar jobs. For the most part, they live in lily-white suburbs or pockets of regentrified historic neighborhoods where few people aren’t just like them.  If they know people who are blue collar, or work on their feet, those people tend to be their lawn and pool guys.  Very few own their own businesses.  The teachers in question are largely public school union.And they are singing in one of the most exclusive groups in the country where a trip to Carnegie Hall every so many years is just part of the package.If that’s not privilege, what is?The irony of the entire situation lies in the reality that people at the top of the pyramid dare to lecture those actually trying to help the ones at the bottom.  The reality that Alexander Hamilton himself was all about what the cast of the musical that bears his name abhors is a bonus ironic twist.  And then there is this:Indeed I can tell you from first hand experience that in the theatre industry diversity is only skin-deep and genital-high. It’s the superficial and irrelevant differences of race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality that the members of the theatre community obsess over, not the more important and challenging intellectual diversity of opinions that they reject and ignore.In many ways, classical music bears the same markings.  The things this writer has heard from the podium….  I do have one friend, an organist, who is gay, and has a sad history that he still is trying to put behind him.  This guy is openly a raging conservative, but really he’s about the only one.  The others, if they are known as conservatives, are very quiet about it.  Our opinions and positions, no matter how well researched and defended, are simply not respected in the political arena among our arts peers.  It makes going out after rehearsals and gigs for bonding sessions a painful experience.The arts, actually, have forever been infested with what we call “liberals” today.  This is not a new phenomenon.  Chastising a member of the audience, on the other hand, has not been done directly from the cast before now.  (We won’t count the number of people affected by Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ.”)  It was done in very bad form.  And those of us who hail from the world of the arts and love it warts and all, are not happy at all that such an event happened regardless of the forgiving graciousness of the Vice President-elect.  The hospitality that the liberals among us claim to espouse was not on display.  There is no excuse for that.

One thing is assured any time the pope – any pope – talks about a “controversial” topic.  People will listen.  Even people who have eschewed the Catholic Church and all she stands for if for no other reason to ridicule and lecture Catholics.  Well, Pope Francis made a change, again, in the absolution procedures for the sin of procuring, assisting in or causing an abortion, and all hell has broken loose.  Unlike earlier in the year when a procedural convenience was made permanent, this change actually is a change.Allow me to explain.In the full list of sins for Catholics, abortion is one of a handful that are so heinous, they are in a category that automatically incurs what is called latae sententiae excommunication.  That means that “by the act” the human puts himself or herself OUTSIDE of the Christian Community.  This is not a formal bull of excommunication that is posted for heresy (teaching or espousing that which is against the Church in one way or another), but a very personal sort of separation.  However, in order to have the excommunication lifted – this is a spiritual remedy, not a punishment – which would allow for absolution (it is not granted if one is excommunicated), there is some administrative paperwork that needs to happen.Earlier in his pontificate, Pope Francis officially transferred the paperwork procedure to the parishes for abortion, rather than sending it through the bishops’ offices, a practice that had been in place in the United States and other western nations infested with modernism for decades.  It just made things smoother.  With Monday’s move, Canon Law actually will have to be changed as the formal procedure of lifting the excommunication has been dropped.“I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,” the pope wrote. “In the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God’s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.”Speaking to reporters during a Vatican news conference Nov. 21, Archbishop Rino Fisichella said procuring an abortion still results in automatic excommunication the very moment the procedure is carried out.Sacramental absolution, therefore, is not just forgiving the sin of abortion, but also means “the excommunication is removed,” he said.Now that all priests have been given the faculty to lift the excommunication and grant absolution, the Code of Canon Law will have to be updated, said the archbishop, who is president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization, the office that organized events for the Year of Mercy.Pope Francis, truly, has picked up the baton of a number of late 19th century and 20th century figures in Catholicism when it comes to his message on God’s mercy.  The main proponent of the message was Pope Saint John Paul II, along with a Polish nun known to him during his life who was canonized during his pontificate.  Her name is St. Faustina, the Divine Mercy image to the left is taken from an entry in her papers, and her diary speaks of Divine Mercy in terms many never considered before. (It’s a tough, but good read.)  By declaring the just completed Year of Mercy, Pope Francis reminds the flock that returning to God is always possible, yes, even for those who are involved with abortion.  The Church is a hospital for sinners, not an exclusive club.In Catholicism, though, there is a catch to receiving absolution no matter what your sins.  Confession must be made, and the Penance (the real name of the Sacrament) must be carried out with a contrite heart.  We are supposed to be sorry for our sins.  That’s something a lot of us need to work on.

Not many people in American media today speak as plainly as Fox News’ Judge Jeanine Pirro.  Very few can get away with the firey rhetoric, and blame laying, either.  So, when something in American life happens that sparks her ire, the crosshairs tighten over the target and BAM!On Saturday, November 19, the judge’s outright anger was aimed squarely at a cast of a popular Broadway musical, Hamilton, who saw fit to lecture Vice President-Elect Mike Pence at the Friday night performance in New York City. Pence was there with his family to take in the popular stage offering.  What the conservative Vice President-elect got after the curtain call was a lecture from an actor playing the part of one of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America who happened to disagree with everything the left advocates.  The Judge’s words to the cast during her opening statement were pointed, adult, and aimed at a class of entertainment workers who over estimate their importance.  Watch:“Out and out reverse racism and teed up hate.”  Not many Americans can get away with that statement in today’s politically correct culture.  Judge Jeanine, though, pretty much said the words that all the people who made #BoycottHamilton the most popular hashtag on the internet were thinking.  No matter what your personal preference, being rude to a man with no scandal attached to his name and who was just elected Vice President is unacceptable behavior.  Lecturing such a person is even more beyond the pale, especially when the subject matter is subjective and the premise of the statement wrong on its face to boot.Judge Jeanine, though, does hammer home a point about the entertainment industry that so many of the inmates of that particular asylum don’t get: art in the form of theater is generally not, at least not anymore, about delivering political messages.  In centuries past, yes, there were plays by notable playrights such as Pierre de Beaumarchais, and Shakespeare that were blatantly political.  Art is supposed to be inspirational and thought provoking, not hit one member of the audience over the head with a sermon just because you can.Such are the times in which we live, when public figures cannot even partake of life in America without being attacked by those they patronize as customers.  The whole episode is just mind-boggling.

Today, a young woman working for an anti-child trafficking organization was laid to rest.  Her name was Monica Petersen, and she turned up dead in Haiti on Sunday after posting “I Found A Smoking Gun” on social media.  Her friends and family are calling foul as her family cannot get believable information from Haitian authorities, and Ms. Petersen just happened to publicly post some reports that implicate the Clintons’ involvement in alleged human trafficking via a mine run by Hillary Clinton’s brother Tony Rodham.A compilation of the various threads from reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Imgur and more can be found on the Reddit The Donald page here.Go figure.  Just like any number of people either close to the Clintons or investigating them who could possibly end up a material witness during a trial, Ms. Petersen ends up dead.  This, for those following the “fake news” propaganda coming out of globalists, leftists, and the disgraced legacy media, is why there is a “Clinton Body Count.”  Monica Petersen’s name may well be added to it.According to several reports, Haiti has been a nexus for child trafficking for a number of years.  In fact, found in the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from John Podesta’s email account, information surfaced that Hillary Clinton assisted a Haitian woman, Laura Silsby, known to be involved in child trafficking in 2010 when she was caught trying to take 33 children – not orphans – out of Haiti.  The two women’s history is known to reach back at least fifteen years.  Also in the Podesta emails are several archaic conversations about pizza that have taken on the aura of internet lore (what some call conspiracy theories) known as #pizzagate, and reportedly is the tip of the iceberg in an international child trafficking ring.The rabbit hole gets very deep when one considers how many times Bill Clinton is known to have traveled Jeffrey Epstein’s private child molestation island.Did Monica Petersen get too close? A tenacious young woman investigating one of the most egregious crimes any human can commit, if she got too close to the criminal element and was known to them, it is a definite possibility.  A good friend of hers named Bella claims she found out what happened and is refusing to elaborate on public messaging boards.  Whatever the case is, the people around the Clintons and those investigating them sure do tend to end up dead.Additional information: this Twitter thread, and Steemit News.

Oh, to be young and stupid again.  Let’s face it, we all were at some point, and had no idea.  Eventually, though, we grew out of it, usually recognizing that there really is something to be learned from our elders.  (Usually.  Not always.)  The problem with the typical millennial is that they don’t realize that is a condition of every generation prior to their gaining three decades of experience of life on the planet. (By that time, if you don’t know that you don’t know jack, you’re probably a professor on a college campus.)Take the special snowflake who actually agreed to be interviewed by Tucker Carlson on his show Wednesday.  This millennial…well, doesn’t know what he doesn’t know.  Watch:Schools are now teaching that anyone from around the world has a right to come here to work, and always has?  Ellis Island doesn’t ring a bell, where newcomers were herded through the immigration lines, documented often with names misspelled, and then quarantined for months to be sure no disease was imported?  I hate to be the bearer of bad news to this little darling, but relatives of some ancestors got sent back to their countries of origin due to disease.  The people at the front of the line in those days were usually skilled labor.  In this writer’s family, even the skilled labor people had every intention of returning to the old country until there was a revolution.  They came here to find work, not draw a dole.LEGALLY.And that is the sticking point that Tucker tried to impress on this special snowflake.  If immigration law is ignored simply due to the low skill sets of the illegals coming into the country, why should ANY laws be obeyed?  The reality is that in the 19th century, this writer’s ancestors came to this side of the pond, some via Canada, to avoid starvation.  Others came due to the plentiful farmland.  Later, when zinc smelting needed workers, yet more emigrated.  All were hated in their time mostly due to being Catholic, and came in under quota systems.  But still, this was all legal.It is a sad truth that many illegals are here due to no fault of their own.  At the same time, it is not fair to those who have gone the legal route for someone to just come to this nation and expect all the same rights and privileges as a citizen.  That’s what Tucker tried to tell this young man, and what he stubbornly refused to see.

Now that the powers that be at Twitter and Facebook are flexing their proverbial muscles and are busy messing with search algorithms and deleting accounts of the “alt-right” for hate speech, a new social media platform is getting a lot of attention.Gab, a social media site where the first amendment is printed on the splash page, and the bug symbol is Pepe the frog (a Spanish name for the symbol of the French?  Okay), was started in August 2016 in response to Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos’ banishment from Twitter for harassment.  The idea of the platform is to allow unrestricted free speech, other than pornography, private information, threats and terrorism.  (That’s on the guidelines page.)  The look and feel of the site is described this way by The Guardian:Looking like a cleanly designed hybrid of Twitter and Reddit, it allows users to post updates without character limits, with memes, links and gifs.The Guardian goes on to say that the site supposedly has tens of thousands of people on a wait list.  This writer went to sign up, and this is what popped on the screen.Looks like a lot of conservatives got there before me.  According to the confirmation email, it may well take up to two weeks to become a gabber since demand is so high, and the system is still in beta.Those who have been able to get in – reportedly the service currently has tens of thousands of people on its waiting list – will see that many of the most read and upvoted content comes from alt-right accounts that have long since been bounced from Twitter. As a result, spending time on Gab feels like hanging out with exiled ghosts.It’s as if the political left did not think that the “alt-right” and other conservatives wouldn’t go looking for another way and place to congregate online.  (Do they really think we are that wishy washy and undetermined?)  The Guardian, and a number of other leftist, and left leaning publications claim that Gab is basically a gathering place for white supremacy racists, but the founder, Andrew Torba, says no.Gab founder and CEO of the service, Andrew Torba, insisted in a “gab” that “we welcome everyone and always will”. But so far, you need to look pretty hard to find accounts not posting a pro-Trump line.Torba also says that it is not “Twitter for racists”. But there is no shortage of racially charged material to be found there.The motto at Gab is #SpeakFreely, and that does have to include racists (that doesn’t mean that the other users can’t vote the material down, though).  So, who is speaking freely at Gab?  Ann Coulter, Paul Joseph Watson, Richard Spencer of the National Policy Institute, and other familiar names on the American political right bannished from other social media platforms for the crime of supporting Donald Trump for president.Torba, actually, was one of the few Silicon Valley visionaries who was pro-Trump.  The other people in the technological hotspot aren’t too happy with him, actually, and last week he was kicked out of Y Combinator, an incubation/venture capital/mentoring group that is considered to be one of the best tech company producers in the country.On Thursday, he doubled down on the triumphalism.The left wing has asserted full control of Twitter now, so the right wing will just have to make do with #Gab, #WeSearchr, Breitbart, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the White House. #MAGA”Meanwhile Torba is ecstatic. Like Dickinson, he’s a pro-Trump Silicon Valley identity whose views and behavior have put him offside with some big players.Before Gab, he founded a social media ad automator. But just last week, he was banned from startup incubator Y Combinator after the organization alleged that he spoke in “a threatening, harassing way” to other members on Facebook in a succession of discussions where he supported Trump.But on Gab this Tuesday, he was celebrating the service’s newfound success: “Today has been Gab’s biggest day yet. Time to upgrade our hosting. :)”It could well be that Gab becomes a hang out for the #AltRight if no one else joins the party.  In the meantime, since Twitter and Facebook are exercising their version of social engineering via censorship, conservatives may as well congregate where we can at least talk without fear of retribution.For more information about Andrew Torba being exiled from Y Combinator, visit Breitbart.

In the battle for the internet, the big question has to do with the United States maintaining control.  (So long as the companies in command aren’t bought out by foreign conglomerates, no worries.)  So far as the actual domain names are concerned, that is not an issue.  Physical storage of data, on the other hand, is becoming one.  Russia, for example, passed a law in 2014 that says social media data storage must be held on servers within Russia.  This week, social media networking site LinkedIn was found to be in violation of that law, and has been shut down in Vladimir Putin’s territory.The Kremlin says there’s nothing to worry about, but Russian social network users fear that blocking LinkedIn is only a first step.Many believe this ban is about censorship and control, not data protection. They’re concerned that more popular sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be next.One vivid cartoon shows the grim reaper, bearing the logo of Russia’s communications regulator, heading for a door with the Facebook logo. Behind him lies a trail of blood from attacks on other sites.Another user declares that the ban on LinkedIn marks “a new era in mass censorship,” while another fears that further restrictions will be creeping: “They’re like sadists, doing it bit by bit.”LinkedIn officials are interested in talking to Russian authorities to resolve the local data storage questions, as local service providers have already started shutting off access to the site.  At this time, the Russian government does not look to be ready to intervene should this issue turn into a bigger nightmare.However, the people of Russia are not happy with the appearance of censorship given the history of Soviet practices for several decades in the 20th century.Social media has played a critical role in organising opposition protests in Russia. Such sites have also become an increasingly important alternative source of information, as state control over traditional media has increased.If that is the case, LinkedIn is a curious first step given the nature of the platform.  But just like with anything else, starting up censorship has to begin somewhere.

Now that Donald Trump is President-elect, not just an American billionaire shooting his mouth off on the campaign trail, all of the various sectors of the world’s economy are starting to actually respond to what he had to say.  Take Saudi Arabia, for example.  When it looked like Hillary Clinton would win the White House, they didn’t say much as Donald Trump talked about the United States being energy independent.  Now that the preferred scenario for yhe Saudis did not pan out, they are facing the prospect that one of their two industries might well dry up.Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih warned this week that banning oil from his kingdom could backfire.“At his heart, President-elect Trump will see the benefits and I think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy,” Falih told the Financial Times.The powerful Saudi minister added that “energy is the lifeblood of the global economy” and the U.S. “benefits more than anybody else from global free trade.”Just to interpret for Americans who do not believe in nuance, that’s a threat and a dare all rolled into one.  Buy oil from us, or else.  After all, the sale of oil is bankrolling Saudi Arabia’s OTHER industry: exporting and setting up Islam in nations where Christianity no longer carries zeal.Don’t know if the Saudis have been paying attention, but the world’s largest oil reserve was discovered in western Texas.  The announcement was made this week.  With modern technology, shipping oil across oceans just might not be needed anymore.Given the events of the last week as President-elect Trump has begun putting together his transition team and interviewing for the Cabinet, his modus operandi has begun to take shape.  He chooses his advisers carefully.  Those who he considers to be part of the problem are not consulted.  That universe may well include the lobbyists for OPEC, the cartel that controls oil output from almost all producers.At this time, the United States does import oil from around the world. The largest supplier is actually Canada.  Saudi Arabia is second with over a million barrels imported daily.Yes, oil is the lifeblood of the world economy.  However, the United States, technically, not only has the largest market for oil, but the largest reserves.  In a right side up economic situation, this should greatly benefit us.  President-elect Trump understands this, and aims to make that concept a reality.

Don’t know about anyone else, but if pharmaceutical companies want to make some quick cash, they need to market whatever ObamaCare architect and guru Jonathan Gruber is smoking or drinking.  He is totally delusional.(Remember Dr. Gruber?  He was the one caught on video talking about the stupidity of the American voter and how great a political advantage obscurity was.)Gruber appeared on Fox Business with Maria Bartiromo, a very smart, very honest woman who knows her stuff.  She started asking him about the economic impact of ObamaCare, and he denied that there was any.  No, really.  Watch:So, just so we have this straight:And Maria didn’t even get to the number of people in the nation, like a member of this household, whose hours were cut from 39 to 29 per week in order to keep them under the “full-time” threshold, thus assuring that they need to work a second job. But, according to Dr. Gruber who is inhaling something not quite right in that ivory tower, this is not empirical evidence or data and should not be used to determine whether or not ObamaCare is depressing the economy.Seriously, anything that causes those delusions could be more popular than most of the happy drugs on the market today.H/T – sundance

It’s beginning to sound like war is going to break out at Fox News.  Well, at least among the Irish assets.  (Yes, it’s complicated. Trust someone who is more Irish than anything else.) The verbally pugilistic prime time talking heads come at their jobs from different perspectives.  Okay, that’s fine.  But go the disloyal route, and at least one of the outspoken Irish is going to call you out.So it seemed was the case with Bill O’Reilly who appeared on CBS This Morning with best selling author James Patterson to talk about his own children’s book on manners which was just published. O’Reilly was asked about Megyn Kelly and some of the allegations she makes in HER book about Fox News, and he took a stance that started to sound like picking a fight.And then Billy proceeded to talk about it on his own show.WHEW! He is talking about Megyn Kelly who has been yakking about the internal atmosphere at Fox News in her “memoirs.”  (Uh, Megyn, you’re too young to be writing memoirs.  Too unimportant, too, even if you don’t believe that.)  Really, O’Reilly does have a point.  If you have a problem in the workplace, complaining about it so publicly is not the way to address the issue.  In fact, that action really should be a fireable offense.  (Point of fact, people have been fired for such things.)  For those of us who have our issues with Megyn Kelly – mainly that she dresses like she should be standing on a street corner, and doesn’t know when to retrench her interests – this was really rather refreshing to see.Bill O’Reilly and his style are not for everyone, but his position is completely defensible.  Sexual harassment is only considered so if the attentions are unwanted.  Why it took multi-million dollar lawsuits settle out of court to expose such an atmosphere – if it really exists – is another question.  If O’Reilly was not involved, even if he knew, staying out of the fray is the best course of action until one is called to a witness stand.Now, time to make snacks before the next round.

Every new leader has his or her own style.  Some are open and gregarious.  Some are micromanagers.  Some are dictators.  Donald Trump appears to be private.  At least about some things.  And to the mainstream media posse that follows around the president-elect, and/or the president himself, that privacy is a barrier to them doing their jobs.  Supposedly.See, on Tuesday evening, the Trump media pool was told the day was done.  Nothing else would be happening at Trump Tower.  Then, later on in the evening, a reporter at Bloomberg posted this on Twitter:
Trump and the family went to the 21 Club in New York City for dinner – and they ditched the press.Most Americans would be chuckling under their breaths at giving the media the slip.  Really, does every detail of the man’s life HAVE to be broadcast to the world?  According to the people who follow the president around, yes.  However, Donald Trump has other ideas and the press is not amused by them.  On the campaign trail, they were not permitted on his plane, and routinely Trump has decried the way in which facts and events were reported.  This is setting up a contentious relationship that will undoubtedly continue when the man moves into the White House.With his Tuesday night actions, the Trump Administration is shaping up to be the least accessible to the public and the press in modern history.At this point, the mainstream media is smarting due to inattention, actually, which could be adding to the rancor.  Trump has not held a press conference since summer, and there has not been one mention of when he might hold a presser in the future.  Previous president-elects have at least held press conferences.  The Trump camp does not seem inclined to do so any time in the future.Many of us out here on the fruited plain are anxious to actually see a Trump press conference once he’s in office.  The media’s big word on administrations fawning over them is “transparency.”  The complaints are already starting that Trump is setting up the least transparent administration in modern memory (they seem to forget Helen Thomas taking apart of Obama’s press secretaries on that score), and all the man wanted to do was take his family to dinner.

One of the keystone issues of President-Elect Donald Trump’s campaign was the promise to deport illegal aliens who commit crimes in the United States.  This should be a no brainer, but due to the concept of “sanctuary cities,” such people essentially can find asylum within the nation in any one of these locales – all run by Democrats, by the way.On Tuesday, after President-Elect Trump once again reiterated the reality that criminal illegal aliens needed to be deported, the police chiefs in Denver and Los Angeles vowed not to cooperate with federal officials in turning over such people to be removed from the country.Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Monday that the force would not change its stance on immigration enforcement, the Los Angeles Times reported. The move is an apparent act of defiance against the president-elect’s promise to deport or imprison up to 3 million undocumented immigrants after his inauguration.Since 1979, the LAPD has barred officers from contacting people solely to investigate whether they are in the country legally, the LA Times noted. During Beck’s tenure, the department also stopped bringing suspects in minor crimes to federal authorities.“I don’t intend on doing anything different,” Beck told the newspaper. “We are not going to engage in law enforcement activities solely based on somebody’s immigration status. We are not going to work in conjunction with Homeland Security on deportation efforts. That is not our job, nor will I make it our job.”Also defiant in the face of growing popular sentiment that violent criminals be deported, is the Denver Police Department:“Immigration enforcement is handled at the federal level, not by local law enforcement,” Denver Police spokesman Doug Schepman said in a statement. “The Denver Police Department has not participated in those enforcement efforts in the past and will not be involved in the future.”In order to find the illegal alien suspects of crime, federal law enforcement needs the cooperation of local officials.  Local LEOs are the ones on the ground.  Refusing to help the federal forces, the U.S. Marshalls Service and the FBI, may not go over very well.  Trump also has threatened to revoke sanctuary city funding for the municipalities that refuse to cooperate.Any way it’s sliced, this may not be all that smart a move on their parts.

Just to change things up, since People Magazine FINALLY recognized the sexy virility of professional soccer players in naming England’s David Beckham to the title, in 2016, the popular supermarket offering gives us a former wrestler and actor as the “Sexiest Man Alive.”Not to discount Dwayne Johnson, because he’s really not bad looking, but what about this?Okay, the sheer number of tats Argentina’s Lio Messi sports can be offputting, but International Football also gives us Cristiano Ronaldo, even if he is from Portugal (in big league soccer this is a problem):But, no, sexiest man alive goes to Dwayne Johnson.  And what does he have to say about it?Johnson is expecting to get some grief from his friends over the title.“It’s coming now. I can just imagine how it’s going to be,” the former wrestling champion says with a big laugh. “But see, here’s the thing: They give me grief, but they all wish. They all wish.”What makes Johnson sexy? “This is the kind of question that gets me into trouble,” he jokes. In all seriousness, he says “a sense of humor” is probably the sexiest thing about himself. “And I think probably just not trying to be sexy and just being cool and confident in your movies,” the Jumanji actor adds. “I think with a lot of my fans, I’ve gotten to a very, very cool place where there’s a direct line between the man they know off-screen and the man they see on-screen.”Dwayne, honey, please, check your man card at the door.So, guys, the real secret to being sexy is to take care of yourself and dress like you care…well, and wearing a kilt.  And, while you’re at it, please, put the seat down.

Former President George W. Bush has a soul after all.  Every now and then word would leak out that he and Vice President Dick Cheney regularly met with the families of those killed in the War on Terror.  It was seen then, as now, as a classy gesture to at least acknowledge that war is hell and families losing their sons and daughters to it was no joke to the pair.After his time in the White House, the former Chief Executive took up oil painting.  As the creative arts go, those who paint, oil and otherwise, after a traumatic experience find the activity cathartic in a way, kind of like the peace of fishing.  After eight years, President Bush 43 now reveals that he has taken to painting portraits of warriors from the Middle East campaign.From President Bush’s Facebook account:Over the past several months, I’ve painted the portraits of 98 wounded warriors I’ve gotten to know – remarkable men and women who were injured carrying out my orders. I think about them on #VeteransDay and every day. Their paintings and stories will be featured in PORTRAITS OF COURAGE – a book and special exhibit – next spring, and I am donating all my proceeds to the George W. Bush Presidential Center and our Military Service Initiative’s work to honor and support them.The Portraits of Courage exhibit will be open for public at the George W. Bush Presidential Center March 2-October 1, 2017.  A book, most likely a portrait-sized coffee table edition, will accompany the exhibit.  From the Portraits of Courage webpage:Our men and women in uniform have faced down enemies, liberated millions, and in doing so showed the true compassion of our nation. Often, they return home with injuries—both visible and invisible—that intensify the challenges of transitioning into civilian life. In addition to these burdens, research shows a civilian-military divide. Seventy-one percent of Americans say they have little understanding of the issues facing veterans, and veterans agree: eighty-four percent say that the public has “little awareness” of the issues facing them and their families.

Watch the fascinating analysis of Rice’s body language here:The latest news from The Daily Caller proves that Susan Rice was lying in her PBS interview:Former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice ordered U.S. spy agencies to produce “detailed spreadsheets” of legal phone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides when he was running for president, according to former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova.“What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday.“The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls.”Two weeks after the PBS interview shown by the body language expert, watch Susan Rice admit to unmasking “U.S. persons” included in intelligence reports to MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell:

WATCH: Susan Rice insists “I leaked nothing to nobody” https://t.co/kAsbu4VJDN— MSNBC (@MSNBC) April 4, 2017“I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today.”What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this? We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi. Why wouldn’t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now. She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it. Yes, red flags are everywhere on this! The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him:Andrew McCarthy said it best:“The national-security adviser is not an investigator. She is a White House staffer. The president’s staff is a consumer of intelligence, not a generator or collector of it. If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests.”The bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked…Someone’s in BIG trouble!








CHRIS CUOMO and other main stream anchors wasted no time in weighing in on the Susan Rice unmasking scandal. Even Susan Rice went out to debunk any claims of spying by the Obama administration. The problem is that the truth is out there AND IT’S NOT FAKE!
Could it be that the Obama administration will finally be called out on their corruption? While Obama claimed there were no scandals during his 8 years, we all know there were many:
Fast & Furious, Benghazi and many other covered up scandals.
It honestly doesn’t matter if the liberal media ignores this current scandal. It only matters that these people are held accountable. In the meantime, Susan Rice appeared on Andrea Mitchell. She claimed to not leak “nothing to nobody”…Did you catch that double negative? There might be more to that because she’s using words in the two sentences very carefully. What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this? We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi. Why wouldn’t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now. She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it. Yes, red flags are everywhere on this!

Remember the emotional testimony of Wetumpka Tea Party leader Becky Garritson:The documents were produced after a revelation by the IRS that it had located “an additional 6,924 documents of potentially responsive records” relating to a 2015 Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit about the Obama IRS targeting scandal. The FOIA lawsuit seeks records about the IRS’ selection of individuals and organizations for audits based upon applications requesting nonprofit tax status filed by Tea Party and other 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organizations (Judicial Watch v. Internal Revenue Service (No. 1:15-cv-00220)).Of the 695 pages of documents released by the IRS, 422 (61%) were withheld in their entirety. These newly identified records are not records that were contained in the “Congressional Database,” which the IRS created in 2013 to house records responsive to congressional inquiries into the IRS scandal.Included among the newly released  material is a June 20, 2013, memo from Karen Schiller, then-Acting Director, EO Rulings and Agreement, suspending use of the controversial Be on the Lookout (BOLO) and Touch and Go (TAG) lists:EO Rulings and Agreements is undertaking a comprehensive review of screening and identification of critical issues. We intend to develop proper procedures and uses for these types of documents. Until a more formal process for identification, approval and distribution of this type of data is established, Rulings and Agreements will not use this technique to elevate issues.In an August 9, 2013, memo, Schiller admitted the IRS used political labels in targeting the groups for special scrutiny and possible audit and that, going forward, the agency would screen organizations based only on their activities, “not words” or “labels of any kind:”As Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel has said, the IRS has taken decisive action to eliminate the use of inappropriate political labels in the screening of 501(c)(4) applications. IRS policy is now clear that screening is based on activity, not words in a name. The new steps and current policies were outlined in the June 24 report, which noted: “In the absence of BOLO lists, the Determinations Unit will continue to screen for information affecting the determination of applications for tax exempt status, including activity tied to political campaign intervention, but it [will] be done without regard to specific labels of any kind.” The 30-day report also reflects the June 20, 2013 memorandum, which was issued to officially suspend the use of the BOLO list in the screening process.The documents also include a “Dear Applicant” letter which offers an “expedited process” for 501(c)(4)s in exchange for restriction on their activities:This optional expedited process is currently available only to applicants for 501(c)(4) status with applications pending for more than 120 days as of May 28, 2013, that indicate the organization may be involved in political campaign intervention.In this optional process, an organization will represent that it satisfies, and will continue to satisfy, set percentages with respect to the level of its social welfare activities and political campaign intervention activities (as defined in the specific instructions on pages 5-7). These percentage representations are not an interpretation of law but are a safe harbor for those organizations that choose to participate in the optional process.On September 30, 2013, Acting Director, Exempt Organizations, Kenneth C. Corbin, sent a memo to IRS staff providing detailed guidance on classifying applications when “‘merit approval’ is not an option,” emphasizing that the determination is to be based on “facts and circumstances,” not “words and labels:”Classifier reviews the application and determines if it should be routed to a specialty group. This determination is based upon facts and circumstances of the stated activities within Part II of the application rather than names or labels. This is consistent with Karen Schiller’s August 9, 2013 memorandum …The Schiller and Corbin memos came on the heels of the May 14, 2013, Inspector General report revealing that the IRS had singled out groups using conservative-sounding terms such as “patriot” and “Tea Party” when applying for tax-exempt status. The IG probe determined that “Early in Calendar Year 2010, the IRS began using inappropriate criteria to identify organizations applying for tax-exempt status (e.g., lists of past and future donors)” and “delayed processing of targeted groups’ applications” in advance of the 2012 presidential election.Of the 422 withheld pages, 98% (all but nine) cited the FOIA “deliberative process” provision under FOIA Exemption 5.“No wonder the Obama IRS has been hiding these records. The new smoking-gun documents contain admissions by the Obama IRS that it inappropriately targeted conservative groups,” said Judicial Watch President, Tom Fitton. “But the records also show that the abuse continued – as the Obama IRS tried to force conservative applicants to give up their First Amendment rights in order to finally get their applications granted.”Previously, Judicial Watch released IRS documents containing email correspondence dated April 2, 2013, from former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations, Lois Lerner, to internal IRS investigators revealing the inappropriate BOLO criteria used to select conservative organizations for screening and scrutiny:The screening [Cincinnati field office] group manager asked his employees how they were applying the BOLO’s short-hand reference to “tea party.” His employees responded that they were including organizations meeting any of the following criteria as falling within the BOLO’s reference to “tea party” organizations: “1. ‘Tea Party’, ‘Patriots’ or ‘9/12 Project’ is referenced in the case file. 2. Issues include government spending, government debt and taxes. 3. Educate the public through advocacy/legislative activities to make America a better place to live. 4. Statements in the case file that are critical of the how the country is being run …”Via: Judicial Watch








With Senate Republicans poised to use the “nuclear option” to confirm Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, will the liberal media hypocritically accuse them of a power grab? In 2013, when then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did basically the same thing, he was cheered on in the studios of MSNBC and CNN.Back then MSNBC’s Chris Hayes hailed it as “an affirmative win for democracy,” while his colleague Rachel Maddow blurted “This is a huge freaking deal. This is like 3-inch headlines. This is like people who don’t even care about politics really ought to care about this.”Over on CNN, political analyst Paul Begala hailed the nakedly partisan maneuver by Reid as necessary, whining that Republicans had “so abused” the filibuster that Democrats “can’t take it anymore.” And Begala’s colleague Ron Brownstein approved of Reid’s decision as a forward-thinking move: “The idea of requiring a super majority for the president to appoint his nominees just is anachronistic.”But the cable network news hosts and analysts weren’t the only ones championing the nuclear option. On the pages of the Los Angeles Times, Reid’s move was celebrated in a November 22 editorial “Democrats bust the filibuster, and good for them.”The Times editorial board crowed: “We welcome this action not because it represents a comeuppance for arrogant Republicans but because filibustering presidential nominees is undemocratic and violates the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution, which says that the president shall appoint judges and other officials ‘by and with the advice and consent of the Senate’ — not by and with a supermajority of the Senate.” The Times went on to call it “a victory not just for the Democrats but for good government.”– Newsbusters








DNC Chair Tom Perez was on MSNBC (video below) to answer to critics who didn’t like his nasty speech last week.He appeared at an event held by New Jersey Working Families Alliance, a re-branded ACORN agency and gave a hateful and divisive speech. He claimed that,”Republicans don’t give a sh*t about people”. Why the Democrats picked this far left radical is puzzling unless the Democrats plan on going full commie…Perez is connected to the radical open borders group La Raza. Something tells us that Obama made this pick for the Democrats.
Check out a defiant Perez doubling down on is nastiness:OUR PREVIOUS REPORT AND VIDEO BELOW:Perez has a long radical history connected to La Raza and other open borders organizations. His track record  is full on radical. e’s in cahoots with Obama to continue the “fundamental transformation” of America. Anyone who’s a Democrat should be shocked that he’s taking the party in such a far left direction. Do your research and you’ll know why he was the choice for Dem Chair.He just fired all Democrat Party staffers and is bringing in all new people.

The most laughable “news” network in America just proved how unreliable they are when it comes to honestly covering the news. CNN’s leftist propagandist host Don Lemon actually told viewers they would not be covering the most important story in the news because fake news publication “The Washington Post” says, “there is no evidence that the Trump team was spied on illegally.” He also claimed the story is nothing more than a “diversion”. In other words, we don’t want you to believe that this scandal is real so we’re not going to report about it…Watch:








During her Tuesday interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice for the first time admitted to unmasking “U.S. persons” included in intelligence reports.“There’s no equivalence between unmasking and leaking. The effort to ask for the identify of an American citizen is necessary to understand the intelligence report in some circumstances.” –Daily CallerBut only less than 2 weeks ago, on March 22nd, Susan Rice told PBS host Judy Woodroof that she knew nothing about the unmasking of people being investigated. Watch the video below, as she pretty much lies through her teeth.

While Obama hangs out in Tahiti, his NSA director Susan Rice and her deputy director Ben Rhodes, brother of David Rhodes CBS News president, appear to be two of the key figures behind the surveillance of Donald Trump’s campaign. What was Hillary’s role in this massive scandal? Why is the media not questioning her? Does anyone really believe she had nothing to do with this? Meanwhile, not surprisingly at CBS News you can find the latest headline:The CBS News headline is followed up by two paragraphs citing the Washington Post (one of the “news” publications who sat on the Susan Rice spying story). The story is clearly a distraction from the real news, which is that Susan Rice and the CBS News president’s bother were behind the surveillance of Trump’s campaign. Apparently, CBS News thinks that an alleged “secret meeting” between a DONOR of President Trump and a “Russian close to Putin” with an “agenda that remains unclear” is somehow supposed to be relevant or important to the American people in the midst of a spying case that makes President Nixon look like an amateur:WASHINGTON – The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between an American businessman supporting then President-elect Trump and a Russian close to President Vladimir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and the incoming president, The Washington Post reports.Citing U.S., European and Arab officials, the Post said the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions. The full agenda remains unclear, the newspaper said.Daily Caller – Former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice ordered U.S. spy agencies to produce “detailed spreadsheets” of legal phone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides when he was running for president, according to former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova.“What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday.“The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls.”Also on Monday, Fox News and Bloomberg News, citing multiple sources reported that Rice had requested the intelligence information that was produced in a highly organized operation. Fox said the unmasked names of Trump aides were given to officials at the National Security Council (NSC), the Department of Defense, James Clapper, President Obama’s Director of National Intelligence, and John Brennan, Obama’s CIA Director.Joining Rice in the alleged White House operations was her deputy Ben Rhodes, according to Fox.Critics of the atmosphere prevailing throughout the Obama administration’s last year in office point to former Obama Deputy Defense Secretary Evelyn Farkas who admitted in a March 2 television interview on MSNBC that she “was urging my former colleagues,” to “get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration.”Farkas sought to walk back her comments in the weeks following: “I didn’t give anybody anything except advice.”Col. (Ret.) James Waurishuk, an NSC veteran and former deputy director for intelligence at the U.S. Central Command, told TheDCNF that many hands had to be involved throughout the Obama administration to launch such a political spying program.“The lawyers and counsel at the NSA surely would be talking to the lawyers and members of counsel at CIA, or at the National Security Council or at the Director of National Intelligence or at the FBI,” he said. “It’s unbelievable of the level and degree of the administration to look for information on Donald Trump and his associates, his campaign team and his transition team. This is really, really serious stuff.”Michael Doran, former NSC senior director, told TheDCNF Monday that “somebody blew a hole in the wall between national security secrets and partisan politics.” This “was a stream of information that was supposed to be hermetically sealed from politics and the Obama administration found a way to blow a hole in that wall.”“That’s a felony,” he told TheDCNF. “And you can get 10 years for that. It is a tremendous abuse of the system. We’re not supposed to be monitoring American citizens. Bigger than the crime, is the breach of public trust.”“We’re looking at a potential constitutional crisis from the standpoint that we used an extremely strong capability that’s supposed to be used to safeguard and protect the country,” he said. “And we used it for political purposes by a sitting President. That takes on a new precedent.”For entire story: Daily Caller








Judge Napolitano explains what’s going on as only he can do – He does a great job!“The Senate has a rule they can force the senate to raise the majority to 60…that’s called a filibuster.”
Napolitano goes on the explain that the Dems are furious because Obama’s pick for the court wasn’t given his day. They also obviously feel Gorsuch is too conservative. The hypocrisy of the Democrats and Chuck Schumer is exposed when a video of past approval for Gorsuch is shown. Schumer, Blumenthal and Nelson are voting no. Democrats who are up for reelection are voting yes.Orrin Hatch on Democrats: “They’re politicizing this whole process. This is a guy who is a mainstream conservative, which they hate. They don’t like that. And of course, they are still upset about my other friend, Merrick Garland. But the Republicans had every right to delay that within a presidential election year.”“I can’t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a Supreme Court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed. And both sides didn’t agree.”








A Salt Lake City town hall held by Republican Rep. Chris Stewart was hijacked by left wing activists who went ballistic when Stewart said he supports building the border wall. Notice how he totally caved on all pro-illegal issues except the wall. The crowd was there to persuade this weak congressman to cave on building the wall too.A hispanic man in the crowd asked Stewart if he supports Trump’s budget which includes funding for the wall. He claimed Trump would be “tearing families apart” if he builds the wall. This is a tired claim that open borders advocates use. It’s supposed to tug at your heart strings. Did those families think about being split up when they came here illegally? Parents sent their children to make the dangerous trip. Were these parents thinking of their children then?
Obama’s policy of catch and release only fueled the illegals desire to make the dangerous trip through the desert to America. He’s responsible for much of the mess we’re in now. Why should these illegals get anything but a trip back home?
Americans should realize that there are people like Obama who believe in open borders and that America should be “fundamentally transformed”. The new DNC Chair is for open borders!
By flooding our towns with illegals and refugees, we will be “fundamentally transformed” – We need to resist this effort to drown out the silent majority by making it the minority.“I do support securing our border,” Stewart said to raucous boos from a crowd that, apparently, believes America should have no borders.He said that, while he does support a secure border, he also supports a plan to give legal status, short of citizenship, to illegal immigrants who have committed no other crime other than entering the nation illegally.And though the crowd cheered momentarily, they weren’t satisfied with that answer.They demanded to know if Stewart supported the building of a border wall with Mexico.“Are you asking if I support the wall? Yeah, of course I do,” he said.NOTICE THE SIGNS ARE ALL THE SAME – PAID SOROS PROTESTERS?








Ambassador John Bolton was on Lou Dobbs tonight to comment on the Susan Rice news. It’s being reported that she called for the unmasking of names for likely political reasons. if that’s the case then she can be charged with fraud…She should lawyer up ASAP. Reports are showing that the unmasking and spying increased as it came closer to Trump’s inauguration. That could be the clue that this was stricly political.
Who can forget her lies on 5 different morning shows after Benghazi. She’s clearly someone who has zero credibility and who should be investigated for using intelligence for political purposes. Throw her in the slammer or give her immunity and make her talk?John Bolton –  “This is stunning news. And you can’t, even somebody as senior as the National Security Advisor, can’t just decide they’d like to unmask names to find out whose name is involved in a particular intercept… If she said that even somebody as senior as her but her real motivation was political she was committing a kind of fraud on the intelligence gathering system and if she participated in that kind of fraud to help the political misuse of that intelligence she’s got serious legal problems here.”.@AmbJohnBolton says Susan Rice defrauded the intelligence system: “She’s got real legal problems here.” #MAGA #Dobbs @POTUS pic.twitter.com/IIqdBN5AS0— Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) April 3, 2017OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SUSAN RICE FROM ADAM HOUSLEY:FOX NEWS ALERT: New details on @adamhousley's report; sources telling him the official who 'unmasked' Trump associates is 'very high up' pic.twitter.com/nowhUIIDSb— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 3, 2017








According to court records, Geek Squad technician John “Trey” Westphal, an FBI informant, reported he accidentally located on a customer’s computer an image of “a fully nude, white prepubescent female on her hands and knees on a bed, with a brown choker-type collar around her neck.” Westphal notified his boss, Justin Meade, also an FBI informant, who alerted colleague Randall Ratliff, another FBI informant at Best Buy, as well as the FBI. Claiming the image met the definition of child pornography and was tied to a series of illicit pictures known as the “Jenny” shots, agent Tracey Riley seized the hard drive.Not necessarily a problem, considering companies performing computer/electronic device repair are legally required to report discovered child porn to law enforcement. The difference here is the paycheck. This Geek Squad member had been paid $500 for digging around in customers’ computers and reporting his findings to the FBI. That changes the motivation from legal obligation to a chance to earn extra cash by digging around in files not essential to the repair work at hand.The allegations are made by lawyers for a California doctor charged with possessing child pornography, after the doctor took his computer to a Best Buy store for repair. Computers which require data recovery are typically sent from Best Buy stores around the country to a central Geek Squad City facility in Brooks, Ky., and customers consent to having their computers searched — and turned over to authorities if child porn is found.While there is no question that Geek Squad technicians have notified authorities after finding child porn, the new court documents assert that there is a deeper relationship than has previously been revealed between the company and federal authorities. The court is now considering the extent of that relationship and whether it is grounds to throw out a pending child porn case, though it could also have ramifications for the dozens of cases which originate from the Kentucky facility annually.Defense lawyers for the doctor argue that Geek Squad City’s technicians acted as government agents by receiving payments from the FBI, regularly speaking with and referring cases to the FBI, and creating a program to search for child porn. If a government agent wants to search a computer, they need a warrant, and the case has raised issues of privacy invasion and violation of constitutional search and seizure rights.Both Best Buy and the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles deny any violations in the search of surgeon Mark Rettenmaier’s hard drive, for which the FBI obtained a warrant after being contacted by a Geek Squad supervisor. That in turn led to a warrant and search of Rettenmaier’s home, which led to the discovery of “thousands of images of child pornography,” according to a reply brief by assistant U.S. attorneys Anthony Brown and Gregory Scally.Underneath it all is the perplexing and disturbing aversion to adhering to the Fourth Amendment we’ve seen time and time again from law enforcement agencies, both at local and federal levels. Anything that can be done to avoid seeking a warrant, and anything that creates an obfuscatory paper trail, is deployed to make sure the accused faces an even more uphill battle once they arrive in court.Read more: WaPo








Intelligence sources said the logs discovered by National Security Council staff suggested Rice’s interest in the NSA materials, some of which included unmasked Americans’ identities, appeared to begin last July around the time Trump secured the GOP nomination and accelerated after Trump’s election in November launched a transition that continued through January.The intelligence reports included some intercepts of Americans talking to foreigners and many more involving foreign leaders talking about the future president, his campaign associates or his transition, the sources said. Most if not all had nothing to do with the Russian election interference scandal, the sources said, speaking only on condition of anonymity given the sensitive nature of the materials.SUSAN RICE CLAIMS TO NOT HAVE A CLUE OF THE SPYING: “I know nothing about this” – The question from Judy Woodruff is at the beginning of the video.

A pair of high school students who take classes at SUNY Oswego via a specialized program are upset at an assignment their “Principles of Literary Representation” class received: Defend Hitler’s Final Solution.CiTi/BOCES New Vision program teacher Michael DeNobile handed out a “Top Secret memorandum” to the class “addressed to senior Nazi party members.” It asked students “to put themselves in the shoes of Adolf Hitler’s top aides,” according to a report at Syracuse.com.Students Archer Shurtliff and Jordan April, who ended up on opposite sides of the, er, “debate” wondered: Does DeNobile really want students to argue in favor of “the Nazis’ justification for genocide?”Although the lesson does tell students it is “not for you to be sympathetic to the Nazi point of view,” and is just “an exercise on expanding your point of view,” Shurtliff and April allege it created a rather intolerant atmosphere.One student did a Nazi salute in class, they say, and another said he wished he’d been assigned the pro-Holocaust side “because Heil Hitler, duh.”From the story:The students brought their concerns over the assignment to DeNobile, administrators in the New Vision program and educators at their home schools.The classroom assignment took them on a mission: To make sure no other student would be asked to argue in favor of killing Jews again.They carefully documented each meeting and conversation with their teachers. They researched other cases, including one in which a teacher was disciplined.They came up with dozens of alternate assignments and materials that didn’t force kids to argue on behalf of mass killings. They contacted the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates for Jews.Within a few days, an alternative assignment was offered. Jordan wrote about America’s AIDS crisis and response. Archer wrote about the internment of Japanese-Americans and compensation paid to survivors.The students said they weren’t satisfied with the administration’s response.They are calling for an apology, for the program to retract the assignment completely, and agree to never give it again.Despite the alternative assignment offered, many chose to stick with the original.Archer and Jordan say DeNobile and administrators defended the assignment, claiming they were told “the essay was a lesson in having to do things you don’t like, and in seeing the other side of an argument.”But Shurtliff shoots down this rationalization rather easily: “It’s settled opinion. You can’t say that Jews deserve to die. It should be a settled thing.”In a letter to New Vision officials, Anti-Defamation League Education Director Beth Martinez wroteThere is no assignment that could ever be given to students that even hints at their [sic] being “two sides” to the “Final Solution”/Holocaust that would be pedagogically or morally sound, and we are very disturbed that students are reportedly being asked to be a part of this.Indeed, the assignment says the objective is for students to go “outside [their] comfort zone” and to train their brains “to logistically find the evidence necessary to prove a point.”High schoolers — vouching for the annihilation of an entire people is … merely going “outside their comfort zone”?

From the White House website:First Lady of the United States Melania Trump is the wife of President Donald J. Trump, and was born on April 26, 1970 in Slovenia.The official White House portrait of the graceful and elegant First Lady Melania Trump:Melania Knavs began her modeling career at the age of sixteen. She would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris before moving to New York in 1996. As a model, Melania has appeared in high profile ad campaigns and worked with some of the top photographers in the fashion industry, including Patrick Demarchelier, Helmut Newton, Arthur Elgort, Ellen Von Unwerth, Peter Arnell, Antoine Verglas and Mario Testino. She has graced the covers of Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, British GQ, Ocean Drive, Avenue, In Style, and New York Magazine. Her major layouts include the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, Allure, Vogue, Self, Glamour, Vanity Fair, and Elle. In addition, Melania has appeared in numerous television commercials and television programs, including co-hosting The View with Barbara Walters.With a penchant and passion for the arts, architecture, design, fashion and beauty, Melania has thrived on the cultural diversification of New York City. This passion can only be surpassed by her dedication to helping others, and her generosity has been noted. She was Honorary Chairwoman for Martha Graham Dance Company in April 2005, is an active member of the Police Athletic League which honored her with Woman of The Year 2006, has been an Honorary Chairwoman for The Boy’s Club of New York for five consecutive years, and in 2005 The American Red Cross awarded her with Goodwill Ambassador which she has proudly served for four years. In April of 2008, she was asked by Love Our Children USA and NASDAQ to participate in the Fifth Annual National Love Our Children Day and the beginning of National Child Abuse Prevention month by ringing the closing bell at NASDAQ. In 2010, Melania was the Chairwoman for The American Heart Association which raised $1.7 Million for research. Melania’s philanthropic interests represent her humanitarian side, and she remains an indefatigable and dedicated New Yorker.Melania married Donald Trump in January 2005. In March of 2006 they welcomed their first child, Barron William Trump.Melania is also a successful entrepreneur. In April 2010, Melania Trump launched her own jewelry collection.In 2006, Melania Trump proudly became a citizen of the United States of America. She is only the second First Lady born outside of the United States. The first was Louisa Adams, wife to John Quincy Adams, the nation’s sixth president.Mrs. Trump cares deeply about issues impacting women and children, and she has focused her platform as First Lady on the problem of cyber bullying among our youth.We don’t recall seeing Michelle Obama’s official portrait, but we’re guessing it looked something like this:The scowl on her face pretty much symbolized Michelle Obama’s 8 torturous years, as the most angry First Lady to ever occupy our White House.








Ailes had been accused by former FOX host Gretchen Carlson and now is being accused by liberal pundit Julie Roginsky of sexually harassing her.O’Reilly tried to make moves on a coworker and is being called out on it…This isn’t his first rodeo Details Below:On Monday, Roginsky filed suit in New York Supreme Court against the cable network owned by 21st Century Fox, its ex-president Ailes and current president Bill Shine. She’s represented in part by the same legal team who handled Gretchen Carlson’s much-discussed lawsuit, which prompted other women to come forward to claim being victim to a hostile workplace at Fox News. The Justice Department is currently investigating Fox in connection to payments to various Ailes accusers.According to Roginsky’s complaint, her promotion to a regular spot co-hosting the mid-afternoon show, The Five, was “contingent upon having a sexual relationship with Ailes,” and when she refused, she didn’t get the position.Roginsky says she’s appeared on Fox News since 2005 and became a regular in 2011. Her contract was renewed three times, according to the complaint. She began appearing on The Five after the departure of Bob Beckel.“Ailes repeatedly called Roginsky into his office for one-on-one meetings, telling her that he really liked her on The Five,” states the complaint. “During these meetings, Ailes would frequently steer the conversation to Roginsky’s personal life by asking, among other things, if she was dating anyone, why she was not married, what she was looking for in a man, and remarking that he did not understand why she was still single since she was so attractive.”The complaint continues, “During these meetings, Ailes additionally (and without irony) volunteered the advice that Roginsky should engage in sexual relationships with ‘older, married, conservative men’ because ‘they may stray but they always come back because they’re loyal.’ Ailes also remarked that he was loyal but that loyalty was a two-way street. These comments and their delivery made it clear that Ailes wanted a sexual relationship with Roginsky.”Ailes would “consistently position himself in such a way as to look down Roginsky’s dress,” adds the complaint.Roginsky complains how the slot on The Five eventually went to Geraldo Rivera — “even though that seat on the show had typically been reserved for a liberal like Roginsky” — and although she remained on rotation on Outnumbered, “she was rarely allowed to lead her own segments, unlike the other panelists on the show.”She says through her complaint that she couldn’t get another meeting with Ailes after rebuffing him.During the summer months last year, others at the network put “increasing pressure” on Fox News employees to defend Ailes and attack Carlson, the lawsuit alleges, so much so that she says she left the Republican National Convention more than a day early. At the Democratic National Convention, Shine allegedly told her that “everything they are saying about Roger is true.”Roginsky also claims that although her allegations against Ailes were known by the network’s top lawyer, Dianne Brandi, no one advised her to contact those at the Paul Weiss law firm who were investigating Ailes’ conduct. The investigators didn’t contact her either. She says top brass “took no action to investigate” and “kept Ailes’ conduct secret and enabled it.”The lawsuit asserts damage to her career path as well as mental and physical pain. Represented by attorneys at Smith Mullin and Golenbock Eiseman, Roginsky is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.BILL O’REILLY ON THE HOT SEAT FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENTWalsh and her attorney are calling for an independent investigation of the culture of sexual harrassment at Fox News.
Radio host Dr. Wendy Walsh is used to speaking about interpersonal relationships, but on Monday morning the psychologist and former The O’Reilly Factor commentator told her own story of how she feels her romantic snubbing of Bill O’Reilly cost her a paid job at Fox News.Attorney Lisa Bloom on Sunday announced the press conference, framing it as a follow-up to the recent New York Times article which reported that five women have received $13 million in payments from O’Reilly in exchange for not pursuing litigation or speaking about sexual harassment accusations against him.In Bloom’s Woodland Hills office on Monday, Walsh told the story of how a misunderstanding after dinner led to her ouster at the network.Walsh says she had been a recurring guest on the show, and O’Reilly asked her to have dinner at the Bel-Air Hotel. During dinner they discussed her future at the network, and he indicated they were going to bring her on as a paid correspondent. He even told her his best friend Roger Ailes was on board with the move. But, after dinner, O’Reilly said “let’s get out of here” and invited her up to his hotel room. The mood change after she politely declined, explaining that as a single mom she wanted to set a good example for her daughter.Prior to the presser, Walsh spoke with KFI’s Bill Handel in an exclusive interview. She acknowledged that the awkward interaction itself was fairly innocuous and described O’Reilly’s move as “Mad Men-style dating tactics.” Walsh told her radio colleague that after the incident at the hotel she tried to “play nice with the big dog” and it never occurred to her to report the incident because she didn’t know job applicants could file sexual harassment complaints.Read more: Hollywood Reporter








White House lawyers last month learned that the former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.The pattern of Rice’s requests was discovered in a National Security Council review of the government’s policy on “unmasking” the identities of individuals in the U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping, but whose communications are collected incidentally. Normally those names are redacted from summaries of monitored conversations and appear in reports as something like “U.S. Person One.”Most of us remember Susan Rice for going on a media lying blitz on behalf of Hillary and President Barack Obama, where she told millions of viewers on several networks that the Benghazi attack was a spontaneous event caused by a video. We all know now this was a lie and that a “video” did not cause the attack on our American consulate in Benghazi. Here is a compilation of Susan Rice lying to the media about the reason for the Benghazi attack:The National Security Council’s senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, was conducting the review, according to two U.S. officials who spoke with Bloomberg View on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. In February Cohen-Watnick discovered Rice’s multiple requests to unmask U.S. persons in intelligence reports that related to Trump transition activities. He brought this to the attention of the White House General Counsel’s office, who reviewed more of Rice’s requests and instructed him to end his own research into the unmasking policy.The intelligence reports were summaries of monitored conversations — primarily between foreign officials discussing the Trump transition, but also in some cases direct contact between members of the Trump team and monitored foreign officials. One U.S. official familiar with the reports said they contained valuable political information on the Trump transition such as whom the Trump team was meeting, the views of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration.Rice did not respond to an email seeking comment on Monday morning. Her role in requesting the identities of Trump transition officials adds an important element to the dueling investigations surrounding the Trump White House since the president’s inauguration.Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are probing any ties between Trump associates and a Russian influence operation against Hillary Clinton during the election. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Representative Devin Nunes, is also investigating how the Obama White House kept tabs on the Trump transition after the election through unmasking the names of Trump associates incidentally collected in government eavesdropping of foreign officials.Rice herself has not spoken directly on the issue of unmasking. Last month when she was asked on the “PBS NewsHour” about reports that Trump transition officials, including Trump himself, were swept up in incidental intelligence collection, Rice said: “I know nothing about this,” adding, “I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that account today.” –BloombergWatch Rice in PBS NewsHour interview here:It appears the political left are having trouble embedding a false narrative or else they wouldn’t need to expend so much energy attempting to deceive their audience.Represenative Adam Schiff is the vice-chair of the House Intelligence Committee and as a consequence of his position he is a member of the Intelligence Oversight Gang of Eight.♦ Adam Schiff can go and look at any information Chairman Devin Nunes has already reviewed. ♦ Adam Schiff does not want to see the intelligence because he would be unable to keep lying about it. ♦ Devin Nunes cannot share the Go8 level intelligence with the full committee because the committee is not authorized to see it; only Adam Schiff can.In order for Schiff to maintain his public protestations, entirely based on politics, he must mislead about the rules and laws surrounding the intelligence product. Schiff must also keep the committee from seeing the full executive intelligence report that is concerning to Devin Nunes. -Conservative TreehouseWatch Schiff caught lying in side-by-side interviews that took place only 3 days apart from each other:Side-by-side clips showing Adam Schiff is lying. Watch. -VJ#SusanRice pic.twitter.com/Qz4rR0TvH9— RealVinnieJames (@RealVinnieJames) April 3, 2017Schiff has had no problem in himself acting as a surrogate for Team Obama or Team Hillary. That deafening silence you hear is the outrage he has expressed over the leaking of classified information to the press designed to fatally wound the Trump transition. Schiff had no problem repeating claims without evidence that Team Trump was colluding with the Russians. Now he is troubled by Nunes citing reports proving President Trump was right about his team being monitored.Schiff and his brethren insist that this still doesn’t prove Trump’s claim that Obama ordered the surveillance. This is a distinction without a difference. It was Obama who ordered a review of alleged Russian hacking of our elections, demanding that he receive it before he left office. It was President Obama who expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share monitored communications with the 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections. Obama made the leaking of communications he arguably knew were being monitored easier and more likely. President Obama wanted to damage the incoming Trump administration.Schiff should be shouting from the rooftops demanding the intelligence leakers be found and incarcerated and that the names of those who approved he “unmasking” of the names of American citizens caught up in the “incidental” collection of the conversations with foreign nationals be revealed. Names of such Americans are supposed to be masked by default, unless unmasking is approved for some reason. As the Weekly Standard reported:Nunes told reporters Wednesday that Trump transition members’ communications were repeatedly intercepted during legal surveillance on a foreign target, otherwise known as incidental collection. These communications were then disseminated in intelligence reports, despite having “little or no apparent foreign intelligence value.” A number of Trump transition members’ names were also revealed through a process known as “unmasking,” he said….April Doss, a former NSA lawyer who spent over a decade at the agency, told THE WEEKLY STANDARD earlier in March that intelligence officials are required to follow strict procedures governing foreign intelligence collection. These procedures protect the identity of U.S. persons.“If the communication appears likely to be worth reporting on — there’s a reason why other people in government need to see an intelligence report that says, “here’s what our foreign target was doing”– they’ll write the report in a way that focuses only on the foreign target and that doesn’t name the U.S. person, that literally inserts something like ‘U.S. person number one,'” Doss said.Schiff was the individual who called the heroes who fought off terrorists from the roof of the CIA annex in Benghazi liars for their account of the Obama/Clinton administration’s denying security improvements, ignoring warnings of the attack, and the issuance of a stand-down order for any rescue, an order they ignored. As Investor’s Business Daily recounted in 2014:The California Democrat who suggested that his party boycott the Benghazi Select Committee as a waste of time now accuses those who fought on the CIA annex roof of lying “to promote a new book.”Schiff, who was not in Benghazi that night, says Paronto, Geist and Tiegen are making up a tale to sell their book, as if their story is less plausible than the proven lie that the Benghazi attack was caused by an inflammatory YouTube video, a myth promoted both by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama.After seeing clips of Schiff saying the contractors were trying to sell their book and Smith claiming a stand-down order “was never given,” Geist said he “would like to invite Mr. Schiff to a debate… we can talk about it.” He wondered if Schiff wished to “say that to my face.”Schiff thought the Benghazi heroes were making it up and now he thinks Nunes and Team Trump are making up the fact that they were caught up in Obama administration monitoring of conversations in which they were involved or mentioned. Schif was not being honest then or now. It is he who is not telling the truth. – American ThinkerMegyn Kelly also DESTROYED Adam Schiff and his LIES about Benghazi. Watch here:

A former Marine and his wife woke up one morning to find the burned remains of an American flag that once flew outside their Arizona home.Brian Ellison was pulling out of the driveway to go to work Wednesday morning when he noticed the charred shreds of red, white and blue.“When I looked down, it was the American flag that we fly on the front of our house,” Ellison told KTVK-TV. “It had been burned. It had caught fire. And then I looked at the flagpole and all of the flag had burned off of the pole.”The family has no idea who would have done such a thing.“This was not right,” said Ellison’s wife, Lisa. “It’s personal.”“Somebody may think it’s their right to burn the flag, but it doesn’t make it right,” said Ellison.Police are investigating the crime.Meantime, the Ellisons promptly hung their spare flag.“I want everyone in Ahwatukee to get their own flag and all of us stand proud and say this is not going to happen anymore,” said Lisa Ellison.

CNN’s Chris Cuomo cautioned “New Day” viewers Tuesday to beware what he called the “fake scandal being peddled by right-wing media” that is the report that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice was behind the unmasking of identities of members of the Trump transition team.According to Cuomo, there is “no evidence of any wrongdoing.”“So President Trump wants you to believe that he is the victim of a ‘crooked scheme.’ Those are his words. And here are our words: There is no evidence of any wrongdoing,” Cuomo said.He continued, “And, in fact, if anything the [national security adviser] asking for identities was a reflection of exactly how much traffic there was involving Trump people and foreign players. The White House blasting the press for not reporting on another fake scandal being peddled by right-wing media.”Follow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideoBreitbart TV, Chris Cuomo, CNN, Donald Trump, New Day, Susan Rice

The reports Rice requested to see are kept under tightly-controlled conditions. Each person must log her name before being granted access to them.Upon learning of Rice’s actions, H. R. McMaster dispatched his close aide Derek Harvey to Capitol Hill to brief Chairman Nunes.“Unmasking” is the process of identifying individuals whose communications were caught in the dragnet of intelligence gathering. While conducting investigations into terrorism and other related crimes, intelligence analysts incidentally capture conversations about parties not subject to the search warrant. The identities of individuals who are not under investigation are kept confidential, for legal and moral reasons.

White House lawyers last month learned that the former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.The pattern of Rice's requests was discovered in a National Security Council review of the government's policy on "unmasking" the identities of individuals in the U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping, but whose communications are collected incidentally.

There remains no evidence to support that claim. But Rice's multiple requests to learn the identities of Trump officials discussed in intelligence reports during the transition period does highlight a longstanding concern for civil liberties advocates about U.S. surveillance programs. The standard for senior officials to learn the names of U.S. persons incidentally collected is that it must have some foreign intelligence value, a standard that can apply to almost anything. This suggests Rice's unmasking requests were likely within the law.The news about Rice also sheds light on the strange behavior of Nunes in the last two weeks. It emerged last week that he traveled to the White House last month, the night before he made an explosive allegation about Trump transition officials caught up in incidental surveillance. At the time he said he needed to go to the White House because the reports were only on a database for the executive branch. It now appears that he needed to view computer systems within the National Security Council that would include the logs of Rice's requests to unmask U.S. persons.The ranking Democrat on the committee Nunes chairs, Representative Adam Schiff, viewed these reports on Friday. In comments to the press over the weekend he declined to discuss the contents of these reports, but also said it was highly unusual for the reports to be shown only to Nunes and not himself and other members of the committee.Indeed, much about this is highly unusual: if not how the surveillance was collected, then certainly how and why it was disseminated.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:                Eli Lake     at elake1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:                Philip Gray     at philipgray@bloomberg.net

							The U.S. intelligence official who “unmasked,” or exposed, the names of multiple private citizens affiliated with the Trump team is someone “very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world,” a source told Fox News on Friday. Intelligence and House sources with direct knowledge of the disclosure of classified names told Fox News that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., now knows who is responsible -- and that person is not in the FBI.For a private citizen to be “unmasked,” or named, in an intelligence report is extremely rare. Typically, the American is a suspect in a crime, is in danger or has to be named to explain the context of the report.“The main issue in this case, is not only the unmasking of these names of private citizens, but the spreading of these names for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security or an investigation into Russia’s interference in the U.S. election,” a congressional source close to the investigation told Fox News. The unmasking of Americans whose communications apparently were caught up in surveillance under the Obama administration is a key part of an investigation being led by Nunes, who has come under fire from Democrats for focusing on that aspect. Nunes has known about the unmasking controversy since January, when two sources in the intelligence community approached him. The sources told Nunes who was responsible and at least one of the Trump team names that was unmasked. They also gave him serial numbers of reports that documented the activity.This was long before Trump sent out his now-infamous March 4 tweets claiming then-President Barack Obama “wiretapped” Trump Tower during the 2016 election.Nunes had asked intelligence agencies to see the reports in question, but was stonewalled.He eventually was able to view them, but there was only one safe place to see the documents without compromising the sources’ identities -- the old executive office building on White House grounds, which has a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) required to view classified or top secret reports. The White House did not tell Nunes about the existence of the intelligence reports, but did help him gain access to the documents at his request, the source said.The White House, meanwhile, is urging Nunes and his colleagues to keep pursuing what improper surveillance and leaks may have occurred before Trump took office. They’ve been emboldened in the wake of March 2 comments from former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas, who on MSNBC suggested her former colleagues tried to gather material on Trump team contacts with Russia.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Friday her comments and other reports raise “serious” concerns about whether there was an “organized and widespread effort by the Obama administration to use and leak highly sensitive intelligence information for political purposes.”“Dr. Farkas’ admissions alone are devastating,” he said.Farkas parted ways with the White House in 2015 and defended herself on Twitter, saying she didn’t personally “give anybody anything except advice” on Russia information and wanted Congress to ask for facts. The communications collected from Trump team associates apparently were picked up during surveillance of foreign targets. But an intelligence source familiar with those targets said they were spied on long before Trump became the GOP presidential nominee in mid-July.In addition, citizens affiliated with Trump’s team who were unmasked were not associated with any intelligence about Russia or other foreign intelligence, sources confirmed. The initial unmasking led to other surveillance, which led to other private citizens being wrongly unmasked, sources said."Unmasking is not unprecedented, but unmasking for political purposes ... specifically of Trump transition team members ... is highly suspect and questionable,” an intelligence source told Fox News. “Opposition by some in the intelligence agencies who were very connected to the Obama and Clinton teams was strong. After Trump was elected, they decided they were going to ruin his presidency by picking them off one by one."Nunes first revealed on March 22 in a press conference that the U.S. intelligence community “incidentally collected” information on Trump’s transition team, putting the information and names into various intelligence reports. His committee had been investigating whether Russia interfered in the U.S. election as well as how names of private citizens from these reports were leaked. House Intelligence Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., criticized Nunes for his handling of the investigation, claiming he should never have briefed Trump. Nunes apologized the following day, but said he briefed the president because the information he found was not related to Russia.The minority members on the House Intelligence Committee were expected to visit a National Security Agency facility on Friday to view the same reports Nunes has seen, an intelligence source told Fox News.Malia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

Recently released GDP figures for the second quarter of 2016 invite the question of how the gross domestic product has fared under each of the dozen post-World War II presidents, a period spanning 70 years.  According to figures from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), average annual real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth in the United States since 1946 (through 2015, the last full year for which figures have been released) has been 2.9 percent.  While that has been the postwar norm, however, average annual real GDP growth has varied greatly by president, ranging from a high of 5.3 percent under President Lyndon Johnson to a low of 1.5 percent under President Barack Obama, as the following chart conveys (full size JPG here):Here is the complete list of average annual real GDP growth by postwar president (in descending order):Johnson (1964-68), 5.3%
Kennedy (1961-63), 4.3%
Clinton (1993-2000), 3.9%
Reagan (1981-88), 3.5%
Carter (1977-80), 3.3%
Eisenhower (1953-60), 3.0%
(Post-WWII average: 2.9%)
Nixon (1969-74), 2.8%
Ford (1975-76), 2.6%
G. H. W. Bush (1989-92), 2.3%
G. W. Bush (2001-08), 2.1%
Truman (1946-52), 1.7%
Obama (2009-15), 1.5%(According to the BEA, real GDP growth in 2016 has been 0.8 percent in the first quarter and 1.2 percent in the second quarter.  Those figures, being from an incomplete year, are not included in President Obama’s tally.  If economic growth does not improve over the rest of 2016, however, his overall tally would drop slightly.)Another way to examine economic success under various presidents is to look at whether the economy ever really grew significantly on their watch.  President Harry Truman’s average, for example, is held down dramatically by his having been in office in the immediate aftermath of WWII.  In 1946, the economy severely retracted, with a decline in real GDP that was more than four times as large (-11.6 percent) as in any year since.  Indeed, one could argue that, from an economic perspective, 1946 should be regarded as part of the WWII era—it clearly was influenced by the war—rather than as part of the post-WWII era.  From 1947-onward, average annual real GDP growth in the postwar era (again, through 2015) has been 3.2 percent.But the economy also truly flourished during portions of Truman’s tenure.  In fact, Truman’s best year of economic growth (8.7 percent, in 1950) was better than any other postwar president’s best year.  At the other end of the spectrum, President Obama’s best year of economic growth (2.6 percent, in 2015) has been weaker than any other postwar president’s.  The following chart shows the best year of real GDP growth under each postwar president (full size JPG here):Here is the complete list of the best year of real GDP growth under each postwar president (in descending order):Truman (1950), 8.7%
Reagan (1984), 7.3%
Eisenhower (1955), 7.1%
Johnson (1966), 6.6%
Kennedy (1962), 6.1%
Nixon (1973), 5.6%
Carter ((1978), 5.6%
(Average best year for post-WWII presidents: 5.6%)
Ford (1976), 5.4%
Clinton (1999), 4.7%
G. W. Bush (2004), 3.8%
G. H. W. Bush (1989), 3.7%
(Average for all postwar years: 2.9%)
Obama (2015), 2.6%








It’s official.With Thursday’s final revision of fourth-quarter GDP growth to 2.1 percent from its previous 1.9 percent level, President Obama is the only president since Herbert Hoover to not have guided the US economy to 3 percent growth in any year he was in office.The US economy grew 1.6 percent in 2016 from the previous years, according to the Commerce Department, which tracks GDP.Obama’s best year, as far as growing the economy, was 2015 when it grew 2.6 percent from 2014 — after growing 2.4 percent that year from 2013.The recovering economy — and steady job growth — gave Obama lots of momentum, but the economy sputtered again last year, Commerce reported Thursday.The government attributed the upward revision in fourth quarter GDP to higher than expected consumer spending in the October-December period.But even with the upward revision, the US economy was in no danger of achieving 3 percent or better growth last year.








On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported that 2015 U.S. real GDP (RGDP) growth was 2.38%.  No matter what revisions are subsequently made, 2015 will have been the tenth year in a row that RGDP growth came in at under 3.0%.  The longest previous such run in U.S. economic history was only four years, and the last time that this happened was during the Great Depression (1930 - 1933).Even worse, and this should be the defining issue of the 2016 elections, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is now forecasting that America will never see 3.0% economic growth again.  This should be drawing howls of protest, at least from Republicans, but there has been little reaction thus far.From 1790 to 2000, U.S. RGDP growth averaged 3.79%.  America needs at least 3.0% economic growth-the nation cannot defend itself and pay its bills without it.  However, America's elites have largely given up on growth, and are now distracting themselves with academic musings about "secular stagnation."Hillary Clinton is trying to position herself as the logical heir to President Obama's "legacy."  Hillary is asking the voters to give her the job of protecting and continue Obama's "achievements."  In a way, what Hillary is trying to do is odd, but in another way, it isn't.  Here's why. The rate of real economic growth is the single greatest determinate of both America's strength as a nation and the wellbeing of the American people.  And, Obama's record in this area has been truly dismal. Right now, the nation is probably already in a recession.  The BEA's first estimate of 4Q2015 RGDP growth was only 0.69%, and there is mounting evidence that this will later be revised downward.  However, making the wildly optimistic assumption that 2016 RGDP growth will come in at the CBO's current forecast (2.67%), Obama will be the only U.S. president in history that did not deliver a single year of 3.0%+ economic growth.Again, assuming 2.67% RGDP growth for 2016, Obama will leave office having produced an average of 1.55% growth.  This would place his presidency fourth from the bottom of the list of 39*, above only those of Herbert Hoover (-5.65%), Andrew Johnson (-0.70%) and Theodore Roosevelt (1.41%)No matter what happens in 2016, Obama's record on economic growth will be considerably worse than that of the much-maligned George W. Bush.  Bush 43 delivered RGDP growth averaging 2.10%, with two years (2004 and 2005) above 3.0%.By the way, the economic growth superstar among all U.S. presidents was none other than Rutherford B. Hayes (1877 - 1880).  Hayes delivered an average of 7.71% RGDP growth, and none of his four years in office was below 3.0%.So, it seems a bit surprising that Hillary Clinton would be running for president by promising the nation the equivalent of a third Obama term.  However, in another way, it isn't.Hillary is a progressive.  Progressives believe in "progressively" expanding the size, power, and reach of government.  And, Obama has done more to further the progressive cause of anyone since FDR.  So, yes, in that sense, it is completely authentic for Hillary to be promising "more Obama" if she wins.With respect to the economy, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are offering what amounts to "hospice care."  Their "tax the rich" redistributionist proposals are not intended to restore strong growth.  They are designed to make the middle class more comfortable in the face of economic stagnation.  "Hey, you may be unemployed after you graduate, but at least college was free!"The only way that the voters will elect a Democrat as president in the fall is if the Republicans nominate someone that seems crazy and dangerous, or if they run on budget-cutting "austerity."  If confronted with a choice between hospice care and "surgery without anesthesia," the electorate will opt for the hospice care, and try to survive until the next election.As the implications of the CBO's latest projections sink in, Republican candidates will hear the political Sirens singing songs about the need to "cut entitlements."  If Republicans offer a credible program to restore rapid economic growth, they will win.  If they offer austerity, they will lose-and, they will deserve to lose.*There have been 44 presidents, but only 39 presidencies.  Some terms were shared by two people, as a result of death or resignation. Louis Woodhill (louis@woodhill.com), an engineer and software entrepreneur, and a RealClearMarkets contributor.








On Thursday we closed the book on the Obama economic “miracle” — and it’s a miracle we are not in a recession.Last week the Commerce Department released its third revision for fourth-quarter 2016 gross domestic product. The number came in at a paltry 2.1 percent, meaning that growth during President Obama’s final year in office — the end of an “Error of Hope” — landed with a big thud at just 1.6 percent.That low-water mark puts the Obama presidency in last place among all the post-World War II presidents when it comes to economic growth.There have been 13 post-WWII presidents, beginning with Harry Truman, who had the disadvantage of beginning in the aftermath of war in 1946, during which the economy contracted 11.6 percent — four times the contraction any other negative year since — and even he bested Obama’s economic record!Truman, a moderate Democrat, also posted the two best years of growth on record: 1950 at 8.7 percent and 1951 at 8 percent, and there was no zero percent interest rate to gin up the economy back then.Thirteenth of 13 presidents is no mild distinction. Obama had eight full years to enact a growth policy, while many of his predecessors never had two complete terms. George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter had just four years each, Gerald Ford had less than three years and Richard Nixon had five.I’m not the least bit surprised the Obama economy was a failure. I’ve chronicled it for more than seven years in this column.Here are the average growth rates for each president:








“The Obama administration and some economists argue that the recovery since the Great Recession ended in 2009 has been unusually weak because of the recession’s severity and the fact that it was accompanied by a major financial crisis. Yet in a recent study of economic downturns in the U.S. and elsewhere since 1870, economist Tao Jin and I found that historically the opposite has been true,” writes Harvard economist Robert Barro. He adds that “the growth rate of U.S. per capita GDP from 2009 to 2011 should have been around 3%...

Trugman at the New York Post reported this week that the final numbers for the Obama Administration are in and they are abysmal:On Thursday we closed the book on the Obama economic “miracle” — and it’s a miracle we are not in a recession.Last week the Commerce Department released its third revision for fourth-quarter 2016 gross domestic product.

A devastated mother joined family and friends at a North Las Vegas vigil Sunday night to mourn the baby boy killed by a bullet before he was a month old.Marcus Thomas Jr.; his mother, LaSharell Pope; his father, Marcus Thomas; and two children, ages 2 and 4; were inside a sedan parked outside a North Las Vegas apartment complex, when a gunman sprayed the car with bullets Saturday night.“He didn’t even get to see Easter,” said the boy’s grandmother, LaShanda Williams.… At about 9:15 p.m. Saturday, a person targeted a parked car with gunfire in front of The Preserve apartment complex, 2655 E. Deer Springs Way, North Las Vegas police said.One bullet hit the baby and one struck 22-year-old Thomas in the gray Chrysler four-door sedan, police said. Pope and two children, ages 2 and 4, were not hurt.Pope tried to drive the two injured passengers to the hospital, but she crashed the Chrysler into a Nissan sedan near Craig Road and North Fifth Street, police said. The three previously uninjured occupants again escaped injury.Gideon Villena, a 21-year-old gas station employee, was taking out the trash at the Shell gas station near the intersection when he heard the woman’s screams.“She kept saying, ‘My baby dead, my baby dead, my baby dead,’” Villena said Sunday.About eight minutes ticked by before authorities responded, he said.Medical personnel took the critically injured infant and his father to University Medical Center’s trauma unit. The baby died, North Las Vegas police said; the elder Thomas is stable.








A devastated mother joined family and friends at a North Las Vegas vigil Sunday night to mourn the baby boy killed by a bullet before he was a month old.Marcus Thomas Jr.; his mother, LaSharell Pope; his father, Marcus Thomas; and two children, ages 2 and 4; were inside a sedan parked outside a North Las Vegas apartment complex, when a gunman sprayed the car with bullets Saturday night.“He didn’t even get to see Easter,” said the boy’s grandmother, LaShanda Williams.Pope briefly took part in the vigil, which drew about 30 people at the intersection of Craig Road and North Fifth Street, for Marcus, who was born March 6. She declined to speak about her son publicly and left the vigil 25 minutes later.Before she left, Pope sat in front of dozens of candles arranged to spell out, “We love you Jr.” Her family and friends held Pope as she wept.Stuffed animals, balloons and a cut-out banner that read, “It’s a boy” decorated the area. Everyone who spoke about Marcus just called him “Junior.”“He was a happy baby for the short time he was here,” said Ava Loftis, a relative of the family. “He didn’t get to do too much because he was only a month old.”At the vigil’s end, everyone sang “Amazing Grace.”Earlier, Williams said she drove in from Los Angeles on Sunday morning to be with her daughter.“I was just down here two weeks ago and spent the weekend with my grandbaby,” Williams said.She said Junior was a joyful baby who always smiled and loved watching television with her. “I just want him laid to rest right,” Williams said.At about 9:15 p.m. Saturday, a person targeted a parked car with gunfire in front of The Preserve apartment complex, 2655 E.

The baby died, North Las Vegas police said; the elder Thomas is stable.Police tape was still wrapped around the traffic light late Sunday afternoon. Burnt police flares remained in the street, and a portion of a headlight cover rested next to fragments of the car’s body on the gravel near the impact site. A small woven basket filled with flowers and a candle was attached to a different pole.Angel Villegas, 19, was in his second-floor apartment at the entrance of The Preserve when he heard several rounds fired. Minutes later, the car crashed.“I was throwing on a sweater when all I heard was a whole clip unload in front of my apartment,” he said.Villegas’ balcony overlooks the area where the shooting occurred. After hesitating, he checked outside to see what was going on. He said a white truck parked nearby had been struck by a round.Police were at the complex until at least 2 a.m., he said.Villegas said the incident wasn’t the first time he’s heard gunshots near his apartment complex.“People usually unload clips at the desert,” he said.Open desert is just across the street from where he lives.The incident does not appear to be a random act of violence, police said.The shooter might have known the vehicle’s occupants, police added.North Las Vegas police have made no arrests in the shooting and need to determine whether the assailant was on foot or driving another car.Anyone with information regarding this case may call the North Las Vegas Police Department at 702-633-9111 or Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.Contact Blake Apgar at bapgar@reviewjournal.com.

LGBTQ activists will come together this weekend to send a message to the Trump administration with one of the most classically queer forms of resistance: dancing.Organized by queer activist collective WERK for Peace in Washington, D.C., along with 350 DC, Queer Resistance, and the Trans Women of Color Collective, the dance protest is a response to President Donald Trump’s recent executive order rolling back Obama-era climate policies and protections.The dance protest will begin in Dupont Circle and continue to Ivanka Trump’s residence.According to organizers of the event, Ivanka Trump ― who recently took an official job at the White House ― claims to be an ally to the LGBTQ community while working against the interests of queer people.“We can’t let Ivanka trick our communities into supporting and legitimizing her. We will show up to her home because the bad decisions of the Trump administration hit us in our daily lives, in our homes, and the nature we surround ourselves with,” co-organizer Carla Aronsohn told The Huffington Post.Aronsohn also called her out for “green and pink washing our climate and queer family” and asserted, “If Ivanka Trump isn’t gaslighting us, then she should come into the streets and werk it!”WERK for Peace and a number of these other organizations have taken part in similar forms of dance protest in the past several months since the election of Donald Trump.The first act of resistance took place outside of Vice President Mike Pence’s home, followed by another a few weeks later outside of Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C.Keep on werkin, y’all. Share this slide:

Susan Rice somehow manages to make Benghazi cover-up seem minorCNN really is ‘very fake news’Letting freedom fadeVermont Sen. Bernard Sanders told CNN Thursday that President Trump’s plan to prioritize job creation over climate change regulations is “stupid and dangerous.”The commander in chief signed an “Energy Independence” executive order Tuesday as a means of rolling back former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Mr. Trump said his policies will cause “wealth to pour into our communities,” although Mr. Sanders frames it as a recipe for environmental disaster.“[This plan is a] nonsensical, and stupid, and dangerous approach,” Mr. Sanders told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Thursday. “It’s almost indescribable. Look, the scientific community is virtually unanimous. While Trump and his friends think climate change is a hoax, what the scientists are telling us it is real, it is caused by human activity. It is already causing devastating problems.”The Trump administration argues on the White House website that its actions will prevent $39 billion in electricity hikes, allow 242 million tons of coal to benefit the American economy, and disbands the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases.“I am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday while surrounded by coal industry executives.Kentucky Coal Association President Tyler White cheered the move soon afterward.“I cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create, but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration’s commitment to the coal industry,” Mr. White told Reuters.Presidents change and lawmakers come and go, but The Washington Times is always here, and FREE online.

Mar 30, 2017RUSH: I sat on this story for two days. You know, I’m slapping myself here. What’s her name — Evelyn Farkas, is that her name? Evelyn Farkas. She went on MSNBC. She was in the Obama administration. What this woman did was unwittingly out the entire Obama administration’s surveillance of the Trump transition team, Trump campaign. She went on TV and basically admitted it and explained how she was behind it, how she was involved in it.You might, “Say how did this happen?” It’s not hard to figure this out. Where did she do it? MSNBC. Who’s at MSNBC? Like-minded fellow leftist travelers. She feels at home. She doesn’t have the presence of mind to realize that she’s blowing a whistle on something. She’s just confirming things among friends. Who can blame her for thinking MSNBC has an audience?So she goes out there, and she basically admits everything. She admits that the Obama administration was in fact surveilling. I mean, it is blockbuster. We’ll get on that. I sat on this for two days and I’m slapping myself for it. I have my reasons. I didn’t trust it at first. That’s essentially what it was. You know, this is a powder keg of a story, and I’m sure the long ears and knives are out for anybody who might get anything wrong, so I held off and held off until I could get confirmation of it from somewhere else. Even though I saw her on MSNBC saying it, I still thought it better to wait, and so it’s percolated and it’s broken out there, it’s now everywhere. So we’ll get into it in great detail here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: One other thing here. We’ll get to Evelyn Farkas, I gotta be really careful pronouncing that name. I have to be very deliberate pronouncing that name. I gotta make sure I don’t get verbal dyslexia or any way tongue-tied pronouncing her last name, Evelyn Farkas. As I say, I sat on that a couple days ’cause I didn’t quite trust the original source. My bad. But the same thing holds: Until I’ve weighed in on it, you don’t really know what it means.But there’s a story out there today, James Comey, the FBI director, wanted to go public with the Trump-Russia collusion investigation details last summer! Summer and late summer he wanted to go public with what they were learning and that there was an investigation between Trump or of Trump and the Russians. And you know who kiboshed it? Barack Hussein O. I think there’s a lot of people covering their rear end and — this is what I say, I’m reaching my limit patience-wise with some of this stuff.Now, this is kind of funny because Comey said he wanted to go public, he was raring and ready to go, and Obama told him no. Obama said, ’cause we don’t need it, James, we’re gonna win anyway. We don’t need it. Hillary’s gonna win, we don’t need this now. We don’t need to gum up the works here. We don’t, we don’t, no, no, no. ‘Cause they thought all summer long they were gonna win and they were gonna win big. They didn’t need all this kind of stuff. So now, Comey, trying to protect his image (paraphrasing), “Hey, I knew all this way back last summer. I was prepared to go public.”What did he go public with? The Hillary investigation. And the way he went public with that? Well, you remember that. The learned analysis of that was that Comey wanted to indict her but that he was frustrated because the Obama DOJ wouldn’t go anywhere near there, so what Comey did was go out and, in his press conference, essentially present the case he had using the public as a jury to affect the outcome of the election.So while Comey was doing great damage to Hillary, we now get a story saying he wanted to go out and do great damage to Trump by revealing what he had learned about Trump’s relationship with the Russians during the campaign, and Obama said no. Some of this doesn’t add up. It just doesn’t add up. Now, the Senate’s getting in on this. And this is one of the greatest media sleights of hand, one of the greatest media distraction stories I’ve ever seen ’cause there’s no “there” there, and yet they are continuing to pursue this.And even as they update the news, the New York Times — this is an interesting point — the New York, remember that January 20th story, where they talked, they had wiretaps and intercepts. This is where Evelyn Farkas comes into the picture. They never refer back to that story. In any update they do, they never refer to that story, and that story used “wiretaps,” the words in the headline, used “intercepts,” it made it clear that they had all kinds of intelligence people leaking to them that there was really something going on here.And yet in every story updated since, they don’t refer back to that story as evidentiary to add to what they’ve all — Why are they ignoring that story? Why don’t they go back and — I mean, you’d be proud of it, right? If that story’s right, that story contains all the goods or enough goods to really cast serious doubt, why wouldn’t you continually refer back to it? But they aren’t.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let’s move on here to Evelyn Farkas, a former Obama administration official. She has let the cat out of the bag. And if anybody needs to be called to testify, it’s Evelyn Farkas. In case you haven’t heard by now, Ms. Evelyn Farkas — you gotta be real careful on radio pronouncing that name, and I’m just exercising extreme caution here. Evelyn Farkas is an Obama Pentagon Russian expert who told Mika Brzezinski on PMSNBC a couple of days ago that the Regime, the Obama Regime was indeed collecting intelligence on the Trump campaign!And, she said, that they were unmasking the Trump people and leaking that info to the media. And that her only concern was that the administration and the Hill, Capitol Hill, would not be able to protect the sources and methods from the Trump people if the Trump people found out. She admitted all of this! She may have outed herself as the source for all of this that ran on CNN and in the New York Times, and it’s clear why she did it.She is a tunnel visioned ideologue. And she went on MSNBC where she’s surrounded in her mind by like-minded people who have done the same thing had they been her and who are willing and waiting to applaud her for doing it. She forgot that MSNBC has an audience, and who could blame her for that? It’s widely known that MSNBC does not have an audience, so she, for all intents and purposes, thought she was at a bar with some of her friends at, like, 6:30, seven o’clock in the morning and that nobody was listening, and she was talking to a bunch of like-minded fellow travelers.She also said that’s why it was so important for the intelligence to be widely distributed, as it was. She left the Obama administration, left the Pentagon, in September 2015. So let me tell you what that means. Contrary to it meaning that she was out of the loop, it means that this intel collection against the Trump campaign had to be going on from the very earliest days. Remember, Trump’s trip down the escalator was in June of 2015 — or was it July? June 15th, yeah. That trip down the escalator, June of 2015.And Evelyn Farkas said that the intelligence collection, the surveillance against the Trump campaign, since she left in September of 2015, and she knew about it and it had to be going on in the summer of 2015, which in and of itself is quite amazing, it’s earth-shattering, it’s blockbuster, given that scarcely anyone gave Trump a chance of getting the nomination.Remember, this is the period of time, you know, Trump’s June the 16th announcement, that’s where everybody was laughing themselves silly thinking he couldn’t possibly be serious. He’s just come out here and basically called every Mexican a rapist and said he doesn’t respect McCain ’cause he doesn’t like military people that get captured, doesn’t respect, all that. This is back in the day when people thought Trump was gonna implode and crater with every public appearance. And that went on for the two months. They were not taking Trump seriously. That’s what’s amazing about this. They were still surviving the guy and his campaign, according to Evelyn Farkas.Now, Comey told us the Russians only wanted to see Hillary get defeated. That’s another thing. How’s that intel? But last week at that vaunted Capitol Hill hearing for the House Intelligence Committee, Comey admitted, oh, yeah, uh, yeah, the Russians wanted Hillary defeated. So why weren’t the Russians colluding with Jeb? I mean, everybody back then thought Jeb was gonna be the nominee. Is that not true?Why would anybody be colluding with Trump? Nobody thought Trump was gonna win. Probably Trump didn’t think he was gonna win. Although he says he did. But June, July, August 2015, folks, we’re coming up on a year and a half ago now. And at that time everybody thought it was gonna be Jeb. Jeb! With the exclamation point. Everybody thought it was gonna be Jeb. Am I right about that? And there was some attention being paid to Ted Cruz. But not Trump.So why weren’t the Russians trying to engineer some deal with Jeb? Why wasn’t there any intel on that? Why weren’t the Russians trying to strike a deal with Cruz? Why isn’t there any intel on that? Why haven’t there been any leaks about that? ‘Cause nobody in 2015 thought that it was gonna be the Trumpster.Let’s listen to Evelyn Farkas. We have the audio sound bites here from March — yeah, but I don’t know that that’s right. I thought this was much more recent than that. Look, we’ll just say “recently” and then — she was on Squawk Box today. So here’s the first bite. It says March 2nd. It was on MSNBC Morning Joe, and they were discussing allegations that the Obama administration was conducting surveillance of the Trump transition team. This is, again, Evelyn Farkas.FARKAS: I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill. It was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people: “Get as much information as you can. Get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration.” Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left.So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about the Trump staff dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those the sources and methods. Meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence.So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill. That’s why you have the leaking.RUSH: She admits it! It was right there! She admitted that they were collecting it, preserving it, and then urging people to get it out. In her words, get it to the Hill, meaning Democrats on the Hill, before the Obama administration left. And we’ve had stories right there in, I guess it was the New York Times, Obama ordered people to preserve all the intelligence being gathered, which has led many people, including moi, to ask, “What do you mean preserve the intelligence being gathered? I thought there wasn’t any intelligence being gathered? I thought Trump was not being surveilled?”But of course he was. We’ve known this from the first story saying whatever it said with the sources being intelligence operatives deep inside the intelligence community. The New York Times with all those stories talking about intercepts and the one on January 20th talking about wiretaps, where were they getting all of this? Somebody had to be leaking it to them and somebody had to be collecting it. And this woman, Evelyn Farkas, just copped to it.You have to ask, “Does she realize what she’s doing?” And clearly, folks, she thought she was with fellow travelers that would be entirely understanding and sympathetic and supportive. She hadn’t the slightest compunction about this.“I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill. It was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people: ‘Get as much information as you can. Get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration.’ Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left.“So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about the Trump staff dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those the sources and methods. Meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence.“So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill. That’s why you have the leaking.”This woman needs to be brought up and testify right now. This woman outed herself and who knows whoever else, admitting that they were surveilling, admitting that they were preserving it, admitting they were afraid that if it wasn’t used, that the Trump people would bury it when they were sworn in. So they had to get it out, because the intelligence was very good. She was worried because not enough was coming out.She talked to some of her former colleagues and after that knew that they were also trying to get information on the Hill. That’s why you have the leaking. Do you know that this story, Evelyn Farkas appearance on MSNBC, has yet to be reported on CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post. It remains an unknown to Americans who only get their news from the Drive-By Media.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I think we can prove my contention that nobody watches MSNBC because I double-checked here, and Evelyn Farkas did appear on MSNBC on March 2nd or March 3rd. It is March 28th this started going public. So three weeks, nobody, obviously nobody watches MSNBC. If it took three weeks for this statement of hers to go public? I mean, if anybody of any substance watches MSNBC, they would have spotted that the moment they heard it! Heck, the MSNBC people didn’t even realize what they had heard.








Mar 29, 2017RUSH: The blockbuster news today that everybody is ignoring, understandably so, is contained in a headline at a website called Circa. John Solomon, who used to be an AP reporter, who was not your typical AP reporter — I’m going back 10 or 12 years. Then he went to the Washington Times. He’s now formed a website or taken over a website that used to be named Circa. It’s his now, and he writes with a woman named Sara Carter.The headline of this blockbuster story: “Obama’s Rule Changes Opened Door For NSA Intercepts Of Americans To Reach Political Hands.” What this story is about is how Obama changed the rules on incidental wiretapping. In other words, if NSA, CIA are targeting foreign actors, and that surveillance picks up Americans, such as Mike Flynn, Obama changed the rules to share the transcripts of that intel with his political people.Susan Rice, Valerie Jarrett, John Brennan, opening, or I should say expanding the universe of possible leakers to the media about what was going on. So an Obama late rules change, two now, sharing intel with 16 different intel agencies, including foreign governments, and now opening the door for NSA intercepted intelligence of Americans to reach the political operatives in his administration.

WISHTV.com The religion of peace, but you have to convert to it to get the peace.But they even kill each other.Eternal peace.Even then many Muslims kill each other for “not being Muslim enough.”+Soleil Or being the wrong kind of Muslim. Sunnis and Shi’ites kill each other every day over tiny tiny scriptural differences. That’s the sad part there will never be any peace even if they had their global caliphate because Islam teaches that the only way to solve problems is with violence.A peace at any price is a piece f the graveReligion of pieces (head and body).Look out here comes the Truck of Peace. The only way to stop this is to ban all High Capacity Assault Trucks. It’s not the drivers fault it’s the trucks fault! Islam has nothing to do with Islam.Then they just give you pieces of the rocks.He grabbed her by the throat, he should be facing attempted murder.most times, throat grabbing isn’t done with the intention of murder. It’s more often done to silence people.I worked as an engineer in a production facility. One of the engineers in my group was a muslim, and he refused to speak to me. Ever. Even when I had to get information from him about line stoppages. One day he saw me coming towards him and knowing I was going to speak to him, he looked around, grinned at me across the floor, and hurried into the nearby men’s room. So, I followed him.The HR complaint came to my boss the next day. He called us in and asked the guy why he wouldn’t speak to me. The guy said I had no business being there, didn’t belong in a factory and I had no sense of propriety. My boss asked him, “…but, doesn’t your wife work”? The response? “Not in a factory with men. My wife is a good woman!”This was 25 years ago and most men didn’t behave that way. But I’d bet money that guy still does.Grandma, I find myself upvoting excellent posts, discovering it, again and again. I wish you were my grandma! hugsYou are a sweetie! You made my day, thanks!If I knew a guy like that I would be glad that he didn’t talk to me. This goes to show that we need to put a stop to them coming into America it hasn’t been too long that Women in America have come a long way to being treated with respect and dignity. Which I find really interesting that the Democrats and the so called Feminist which they are nothing but a bunch of Phony’s. That they would allow these people to come into our Country with the way they treat their Women, Children and Homosexuals. Even the LGBTQ would want People like that here with the way they treat the Gays and Lesbians. Deport now before it’s too late.Kill it…..Chances he will be convicted of anything: NIL.I’m not so sure about that. this isn’t europeBut he’ll have a good lawyer who pleads both insanity AND religious persecution; and the trial will feature a judge named – oh, I don’t know – Mohammed?hahaha. sheeeit…Muncie has not seen the end of this terrorist.Right? We all know how the final chapter of this story ends I don’t know why we let it keep happening.0 tolerance please, just kill him if he attack the police, dont worry about the libtards crying in twitterIf only the MSM would report incidents like this for ALL to know and see. Maybe their audience wouldn’t be so misinformed or clueless and remain Islam apologists.Coworker used to wash his feet in the sink on lunch break – when i told him to mind his manners he shouted that Allah will punish me and I will burn in hell. Later he kept singing a chant everytime he saw me, laughed at me and shook his head. I complained to my boss but I was told to let him be. Guy was fired few weeks later for something else.A Goodwill Store. What, is charity un-Islamic too? —Ddid the guy break the cops hand by repeatedly hitting him in the hand with his face?I HOPE so! LOL!All throughout the ordeal he still managed to break one officer’s hand and not a single one of them thought to ventilate him?Just kill himGet these oeople out of my country!SHOOT THE MOTHERFUCKER BETWEEN THE FUCKING EYESand miss all the vital spots? what a waste of a bullet+Dion G If I remember correctly from my history channel documentaries I used to watch (back before it was the pawn stars channel) you want to hit them in the fatal T of the brain stem so maybe a bit below the eyes? If you were looking right at them hit them under the nose I’m thinking? In WW2 the Commisars used to execute people with a bullet to the back of the neck right at the base of the skull. I think that’s about halfway down or towards the bottom of this fatal T.Islam promotes an imperial peace. Tyranny will keep us inline.Could followers of this bogus religion be possessed by malignant spirits? There is no other explanation why they are so violent and hate-filled.There doesn’t always have to be a supernatural reason for evil. Human beings are capable of disgusting things under the right circumstances. When you have a religion that tells you that you’re superior to everyone and have the right to do whatever you like to whoever you want, that gives you free reign to be an absolutely uncontrollable monster.+Matt True but this spirit possession type zombie cult behavior the left is exhibiting has been talked about by cultures for millennia all across the globe. Even if it is all in their heads, there is some kind of mass psychosis or something going on.i hope the cop broke his hand on this animals face.DEPORTIslam…Nuke it from orbit, it’s the only way to make sure. A goodwill store has at least 5 employees. What were they doing during this just watching him beat and choke her? And wtf he broke the cops hand?? I sure wish it was back in the day where if you made the police mad you didn’t go to the station, they took you 86. 80 miles out of town and 6 feet under ground.TMB Typical Muslim Behavior, Total savagesHe should have been shot for assaulting the cops. He even managed to break the officer’s hand! Man, why are police so afraid to shoot these savages and deal with them the way they fucking deserve?








Want a free cup of coffee? Starbucks has got you covered.All you have to do is drink it while talking to someone you disagree with. That’s the premise behind the coffee behemoth’s collaboration with Harvard Business School startup ‘Hi from the Other Side,’ which matches up liberals and conservatives to create healthy conversation about American politics. The startup announced the partnership last week.Here’s how it works: Users can sign up for the app via Facebook and are then paired with someone nearby who identifies with the opposing political party. Each user then receives half of the information necessary to unlock a Starbucks gift card. Then, once both participants meet up, they can work together to unlock the gift cards and receive a complimentary cup of java.The startup has been featured by national news outlets, including Mashable and The Washington Post, and it has received high praise from its users. It was founded by Harvard Business School student Henry Tsai.Starbucks has been no stranger to political discourse lately. The company’s CEO, Howard Schultz, sent a memo to employees on the day after the election, admitting he was “stunned” by the election outcome and encouraging Starbucks workers to “take care of each other and the people in our lives.” He also vowed to hire 10,000 refugees in response to President Trump’s executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
