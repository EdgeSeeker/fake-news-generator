by American News  1 day ago0Taking things to a new extreme, liberals are demanding that Bill O’Reilly be fired after he made fun of Maxine Waters’ hair. Apparently, that makes him a racist. Of course, these are the same people who have spent the last two years making fun of President Donald Trump’s hair. During an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Monday, O’Reilly joked that he couldn’t take Water’s seriously during one of her anti-Trump speeches because of her “James Brown wig.” “I didn’t hear a word she said,” he commented. “I was looking at the James Brown wig.” The comment was made after O’Reilly joked that he “loves” Waters and hopes to see more of her—in her own sitcom. “People get angry at Maxine Waters,” O’Reilly laughed. “I want more of it.”“She’s a sincere individual, whatever she says she believes,” he continued, in a more serious tone. “I love you Maxine. I want to see you on The Factor, and when hell freezes  over, I’m sure that will happen.” After receiving immense backlash, O’Reilly addressed his controversial comments, saying: “As I have said many times, I respect Congresswoman Maxine Waters for being sincere in her beliefs. I said that again today on Fox & Friends calling her ‘old school.’ Unfortunately, I also made a jest about her hair which was dumb. I apologize.” They need to fire  #RacistBillOReilly for his James Brown hair comment about Maxine Waters just like they fired… https://t.co/doSaJxyjna— BRUCE GEORGE (@BRUCEGEORGE1) March 28, 2017NEWS / by American News -  1 day agoGiven the hostility being thrown their way almost every day since Clinton lost the election, Trump supporters have banded together.

by American News  1 day ago0Given the hostility being thrown their way almost every day since Clinton lost the election, Trump supporters have banded together. You’d better believe they are going to take a stand against violence—especially if you hurt an innocent woman. This past weekend at a “Make America Great Again” rally in Huntington Beach, a masked Never-Trumper pepper-sprayed and punched event organizer Jennifer Sterling. Trump supporters quickly took action, beating down a group of protesters who came to violently disrupt their event. Unfortunately, a massive brawl erupted, forcing many arrests. Travis Guenther—whose wife was also pepper-sprayed at the rally—chased down the masked man who assaulted his wife. When he caught up to him, he hit him with a flag that read: “Trump, Make America Great Again.” “We’re not xenophobic. We’re not racist. We’re just proud Americans,” Guenther told the Los Angeles Times of the incident.Steele Vaz, 17, was shocked when he saw a masked man pepper-spray and punch Jennifer Sterling, who organized the event. “They sprayed her. They were punching her,” Vaz told local reporters. “I was here to support [Trump] but I didn’t know it was going to be violent.” The Huntington Beach rally was just one of 40 pro-Trump events that were scheduled throughout the country on Saturday. Though not all of them ended in violence, many were disrupted by masked protesters who assaulted Trump supporters.  Fans of our president are not scared away, however. “That is even more reason to go,” one woman commented.

by American News  1 day ago0This week, a billboard for a North Carolina jewelry store came under fire for supposedly encouraging violence against women. When Spicer Greene Jewelers created their ad, they thought it was just a “play on words.” But in today’s politically-charged climate, it caused quite the storm. “Sometimes, it’s ok to throw rocks at girls…” the sign, which features photos of gemstones, reads. No but it's ok to throw rocks at whoever approved this billboard. pic.twitter.com/9pd3Rj9mu8— OhNoSheTwitnt (@OhNoSheTwitnt) March 23, 2017The billboard was placed in a high-traffic area near Interstate 240 in Asheville. It caught the attention of many who were outraged at the message.  Ellen Perry, a teacher at UNCA and AB Tech, told WLOS that she was planning a protest outside of the store and would continue protests until the sign was removed. Spicer Greene Jewelers quickly responded to the outrage with a public apology on Facebook. Four years ago, Eva-Michelle Spicer, 28, and her husband Elliot, 27, recently took over the store, which has been in operations since 1926. “The billboard was intent to be a nostalgic thought of a childhood teaching,” Eva-Michelle Spicer said. “That it’s not ok to throw rocks at girls, it’s not ok to throw rocks at anyone…It saddens me that it was taken that way, because it certainly wasn’t intended.” It’s clear that Spicer was not intending to demean women.  In fact, she is a member of Women for Women, an organization designed to “improve the lives of women and girls through women’s collective giving.” She has also fundraised for an Asheville-based crisis intervention and prevention agency that helps victims of sexual abuse.  In response to the criticism, she announced that the store will donate 10% of sales through Sunday to Helpmate because “domestic violence and rape culture is not something to be taken lightly at all.” Here is the statement made by the company: To whom we have offended with our recent billboard, please accept our #apologies.

by American News  1 day ago0Recently, Judge Andrew Napolitano was criticized by the mainstream media for the strong stand he took in defense of President Donald Trump, supplying more evidence about how President Obama asked British spies to run surveillance on Trump Tower. The pressure was so immense, Fox News ended up kicking the legal expert off of their network. Now, Napoiltano has stepped back into the spotlight—and he has some devastating news to deliver.He appeared as a guest on the program America’s Newsroom, after hearing a statement by Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters. The statement said, “Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct ‘wiretapping’ against the then-President Elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.” “You still stand by that?” host Bill Hemmer asked. “Yes, I do, and the sources stand by it and the American public needs to know more about this rather than less because a lot of government surveillance authorities will expire in the fall,” Napolitano responded. “There will be a great debate about how much authority we want the government to have to surveil us and the more the American public knows about this, the more informed their and Congress’ decision will be,” he added. “I think a lot more is going to come.”What do you think of Napolitano doubling down on his original statement?

by American News  1 day ago0Massachusetts state Rep. Michelle DuBois took to Facebook this week to warn her followers about upcoming Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that are set to take place in her area.  Obviously, her comment was not received well by the American public. “ICE raid in Brockton (MA) on 3/28,” DuBois wrote on Tuesday. “I got the following information from my friend in the Latin community: ‘I have a message for the immigration community of Brockton. Please be careful on Wednesday 29. ICE will be in Brockton on that day.’”“If you are undocumented, don’t go out on the street,” DuBois, who represents the 10th district, warned. “If there is a knock on the door of your house and you don’t know who it is, don’t open the door. I ask you to be careful.”She even went as far as to include a phone number to call if someone you know is detained by the ICE and a chart that explains “what to do if ICE comes to your door.”  Within in a day, Bristol County (MA) Sheriff Thomas Hodgson spoke out to criticize DuBois for “completely [undermining] law enforcement.”  But he wasn’t the only one to speak out—DuBois was receiving so many negative responses to her post that she started deleting them.“I am deleting attacks [on the original posts],” she wrote in one response. “This post is to inform. Not to debate immigration policy. It’s my page and I can delete posts.” “This post is just to spread awareness of the seriousness of the new immigration policies instituted by Trump,” she continued. “It should motivate those who can gain documentation to do so and others who can’t, to start making a plan for the safety of their family.”What do you think? Is this completely unacceptable? Should DuBois be punished for her actions?

by American News  1 day ago0After finally leaving the White House, Barack and Michelle Obama moved two a mansion in the affluent Washington D.C. neighborhood of Kalorama—just two miles away. A few days later, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner moved in to a mansion two blocks away. The result is pure chaos for long-time residents. According to DC Curbed, neighbors have complained that there has been a dramatic decrease in parking spaces in the area over the past two months because of the presence of Secret Service agents. Contributing to the problem are large barricades that have been set up near the Obamas’ and Kushners’ homes. “Sometimes there are 10 cars out here,” Marti Robinson, a trial attorney who lives across the street from the Kushners, told local reporters. “They’ve completely taken over the whole street—as if they have the authority!”Meanwhile, access to Obama’s street has been completely blocked off to cars and pedestrians.  The Secret Service said that the agency “makes every effort to collaborate with businesses and residents to minimize disruptions, while simultaneously maintaining the highest level of security for the individuals we are mandated to protect.” NEWS / by American News -  1 day agoTaking things to a new extreme, liberals are demanding that Bill O’Reilly be fired after he made fun of Maxine Waters’ hair.

by American News  1 day ago0Throughout Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House, welfare abuse reached an all-time high. Apparently, the former president was content to allow millions of able-bodied Americans to obtain benefits and live off of the tax dollars of hardworking Americans. That’s why videos like this one are so infuriated. The now-viral footage shows a proud welfare recipient bragging about how large she is living thanks to the benefits she receives from the government.  She even encourages anyone who is working for a living to just sit back and enjoy tax benefits as well. Fortunately, this tip of abuse is almost certain to stop under President Donald Trump, who has named making Americans self-sufficient as a priority. Watch the clip below and tell us what you think.

by American News  1 day ago0This week, Hollywood is mourning the loss of Darlene Cates, who is best known for playing Leonardo DiCaprio’s mother in “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape.” Cates passed away on Sunday at the age of 69-years-old. In a post on Facebook, Cates’ daughter announced that her mother died unexpectedly in her sleep.“It is with a bitter-sweet heart that we share that our precious wife, mother, and Gaga, Darlene Guthrie Cates, was called Home, somewhat unexpectedly, peacefully in her sleep,” Sheri Cates Morgan wrote. “We take comfort in knowing that she is no longer in pain and is in the arms of our Heavenly Father, breaking away only to dance with our Savior, Jesus. (Dancing was something she talked about loving to do ‘back in the day’!).”Cates was cast as Bonnie Grape in “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape” after the film’s screenwriter, Peter Hedges, saw her on an episode of the Sally Jessy Raphael television show “Sally.” In the episode, Cates discussed obesity and the pelvic infection that caused her to gain 150 pounds.“I’ll always remember you as the best acting momma I’ve ever had,” DiCaprio wrote in a note to the actress. “You triumphed in your role.” Rest in peace, Darlene!NEWS / by American News -  1 day agoTaking things to a new extreme, liberals are demanding that Bill O’Reilly be fired after he made fun of Maxine Waters’ hair.

by American News  2 days ago0In 2002, now-Vice President Mike Pence told The Hill that he will never eat alone with any woman but his wife. He also claimed to avoid events that serve alcohol if his wife is not present, citing his Christian faith for his personal choice.Last week, the 15-year-old information was featured in a Washington Post profile of Karen Pence—and liberals just lost it.Journalist Xena Jardin compared Pence’s decision not to dine with other women to the “repressive interpretations of Islam.” That is not only absolutely absurd—it’s none of her business. Clara Jeffrey, the editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, also suggested that this implies that Pence “won’t hire women in key spots.” Apparently, liberals are even using personal marital decisions to bash Trump.

by American News  2 days ago0In an astounding turn of events, one of the “Women’s March on Washington” and “Day Without Women” organizers is being kicked out of the United States after it was revealed that she failed to disclose on her U.S. visa 20 years ago that she was a convicted criminal. Rasmea Yousef Odeh was reportedly convicted of murdering two Israeli students in a supermarket bomb attack and for an attempted bombing of the British Consulate in 1969. After a decade in prison, Odeh was freed in a prison swap. For the last 20 years, Odeh has lived in Chicago, but in 2014 she was tried and convicted for immigration fraud for lying on her U.S. visa application. This week, she found out that she lost her appeal. She was reportedly given two choices: get out of the country or go to jail.She has chosen to leave the United States, though she has one more court date in Detroit in April before she will depart.

by Kristina Wong31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Everyone who’s been briefed on this subject, from Republican to Democrat to CIA — former Obama administration’s [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper, [CIA Director John] Brennan, you name it — all of the people come back with the same conclusion…that there’s been no evidence,” he said at the White House press briefing.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSpicer said if anyone was trying to engage with Russia, it was Hillary Clinton.“It was Hillary Clinton, who was the architect of the last administration’s failed reset policy — she told Russian state TV that it was designed to strengthen Russia. That was their goal: to strengthen Russia,” he said.“She used her office to make concession after concession, selling off one-fifth of our country’s uranium, paid speeches, paid deals, getting personal calls from Vladimir Putin. I think if there’s — really want to talk about a Russian connection and the substance, that’s where we should be looking,” he added.Spicer was referring to how in 2010, then-Secretary of State Clinton was one of nine to sign off on Russia’s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada. Around the same time, a Russian investment bank paid Bill Clinton $500,000 to give a speech.“When you talk about connections to Russia, the only connection that anyone’s made with President Trump is multiple years ago he hosted a pageant there and he’s — some of the — you know, he owns condos around the world and some of them were sold to some Russians and I think he sold a house to one several years back. That’s his connection,” he said.“So when you compare the two sides in terms of who’s actually engaging with Russia, trying to strengthen them, trying to act with them, trying to interact with them, it is night and day between our actions and her actions,” he said. “And yet no one questioned what she was doing or how she was handling it.”Critics of President Trump have argued that his campaign aides colluded with Russia to help him get elected.While intelligence officials have assessed that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. elections in favor of Trump by hacking into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton aide John Podesta and leaking embarrassing emails, there has been no evidence that Russia affected the outcome of the election or that there was collusion with Trump campaign officials.The FBI is investigating the matter, and the House and Senate intelligence committees are also investigating it. But Clapper told NBC News on March 5 that no evidence existed that showed any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.“Not to my knowledge,” he said, when asked if any evidence existed. Clapper said there could have been information found since he left the government on January 20, but as of then, “We had no evidence of such collusion.”Big Government, National Security, collusion, Hillary Clinton, Sean Spicer, Trump, Trump Campaign








by Kristina Wong31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer highlighted two during the White House press briefing.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROne was an interview on March 2, in which former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas described to MSNBC how she urged former colleagues in government to save and spread as much information on Russia as they could before Trump came into office.Farkas said, according to an exact transcript of the interview:I was urging my former colleagues and — and frankly speaking, people on the Hill — it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, ‘Get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,’ because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left, so it would be hidden away, in the bureaucracy, that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their — the staff, the Trump staff’s dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence, so I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill. That’s why you have the leaking. People are worried.Spicer said that interview “raised serious concerns on whether or not there was an organized and widespread effort by the Obama administration to use and leak highly sensitive intelligence information for political purposes.”Separately, Spicer pointed to an NBC News report on Friday that appeared to corroborate Farkas’s comments.It said Obama administration officials were so concerned about what would happen to key classified documents related to a probe into Russian interference in the elections once Trump took office that they created a list of document serial numbers to give to senior members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.A former Obama official told NBC News that the list was created in early January and that he “hand-carried it” to committee members. He said the purpose was to make it “harder to bury” the information, to “share it with those on the Hill who could lawfully see the documents,” and to make sure it could reside in an intelligence committee safe, “not just at Langley” — the CIA’s headquarters.“Dr. Farkas’s admissions alone are devastating,” Spicer said.Critics of the administration have pointed out on social media that Farkas left the administration in September 2015, but the concern is not whether she herself tried to save and spread intelligence, but that she was urging some of her former colleagues still in the administration to do so, and knew of some who “were trying to also help get information to the Hill.”Farkas has also been described as a Hillary Clinton campaign adviser, including in a March 2017 New Yorker report.During the briefing Spicer also suggested that administration officials may have more evidence to back up Farkas’s account—as well as Trump’s assertion that his campaign was being spied on by the Obama administration—that they intended to share with congressional leaders.Spicer said the White House had invited House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) and ranking member Adam Schiff (D-WA) to the White House on Friday. Schiff was later seen entering the White House.“There is a — there is a concern that people misused, mishandled, misdirected classified information, leaked it out, spread it out, violated civil liberties. And the potential that that should — that that happened should concern every single American,” Spicer said.“Day by day, more and more, we are seeing that the substance of what we’ve been talking about continues to move exactly in the direction the president spoke about in terms of surveillance that occurred. And that should be very troubling,” he said.Big Government, National Security, Evelyn Farkas, Farkas, Nunes, surveillance, Trump, White House, wiretap








by Neil W. McCabe31 Mar 2017Washington0SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Unmasking is not unprecedented, but unmasking for political purposes … specifically of Trump transition team members … is highly suspect and questionable,” an intelligence source told Fox News. “Opposition by some in the intelligence agencies who were very connected to the Obama and Clinton teams was strong. After Trump was elected, they decided they were going to ruin his presidency by picking them off one by one.”Housley said his sources inside the intelligence community reached out to him after mainstream media reports Thursday flagged two White House aides as the sources bringing information to Rep. Devin Nunes (R.-CA), the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThursday’s mainstream media narrative was that Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis called Nunes to the White House grounds March 21, where they passed classified information to Nunes that confirmed Obama administration surveillance of the Trump camp. Then, March 22, Nunes went to the White House to present classified information to the president.This narrative and the Nunes back-and-forth with the White House was ridiculed as an elaborate ruse or proof that Nunes was acting in a bizarre way.The Housley report is that Thursday’s narrative was not true–and that Cohen-Watnick and Ellis were not sources at all; rather the two men came to the aid of Nunes, who had other sources but needed to use a Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Facility (SCIF) that was not associated with the whistleblowers’ own agency.The sources told Fox News that surveillance of the Trump campaign began before Trump became the Republican presidential nominee July 19, and the surveillance had nothing to do with Russia, Housley said.Intelligence agencies are banned from collecting intelligence on Americans without permission from a judge, but in the course of authorized surveillance Americans are caught in the net. These names are supposed to be masked or disguised, so that their rights are preserved. What Fox News is reporting is that these names were either put in the clear or given flimsy masks, so that their identity was obvious.The sources also told Housley that Nunes learned about the surveillance and the unmasking in January, before Trump entered the White House, but members of the intelligence community have been uncooperative as the chairman searched for a SCIF, where he could conduct his own deep dive into their portent. Finally, he was able to secure use of the White House SCIF inside the Old Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds, but not in the “White House.”Fox News investigative reporter Malia Zimmerman also worked on this report.Big Government, Breitbart California, adam housley, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, FBI, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, intelligence community, Malia Zimmerman, Michael Ellis, President Donald Trump, Rep.

Marlow31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAccording to comments made Thursday by ESPN’s Jim Miller on SI Media Podcast with Richard Deitsch, dozens of employees will soon join the unemployment lines.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“The way that I’ve heard it—and I’ve kind of run the numbers on it, I think we’re looking at between 40 and 50 people,” Miller said. “And look, there’s a lot of uncertainty about who it’s gonna be and why. Remember, this is not quantum physics, so it’s not an exact equation.”The plight of ESPN is no trivial matter for entertainment giant Disney, the parent company for the “Worldwide leader in sports entertainment.” In February, The Wrap reported, “Cable networks, particularly ESPN, have been an albatross on Disney’s stock price even as the company’s two other major prongs, movies, and theme parks, continue to perform well. “As cheaper TV alternatives began to proliferate, ESPN hemorrhaged subscribers during the course of 2016 and is now at less than 88 million, compared with a peak of 100.1 million in 2011. At an estimated $7 per subscriber, that dip has been a substantial hit to Disney, especially considering media networks made up 49 percent of Disney’s profits during fiscal 2016.”Miller presented a potential revised line up for the beleaguered network:
6 a.m. — Re-air of Neil Everett and Stan Verrett’s SportsCenter from the night before7-10 a.m. — Mike Greenberg’s newly announced show, which, as Miller points out, will feature only one on-air personality10 a.m.-noon — First Take, presumably still featuring Stephen A. Smith, Max Kellerman and Molly QerimNoon-1 p.m. — A widely rumored but yet-to-be-unveiled show featuring Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre1-6 p.m. —”The normal kind of coverage of what they’re doing, and Around the Horn and PTI6 p.m. — SC6 with Jemele Hill and Michael SmithEvening — Live sports11 p.m. — SportsCenterMidnight — Scott Van Pelt’s SportsCenter show1 a.m. — Everett and Verrett’s SportsCenter showMiller went on to say, “If you’re ESPN talent and you’re looking at a schedule that’s something like that, based on the commitments they’ve made, if you’re not on that, then you’re starting to feel a little shaky.” But, he caveated,  “That’s not to say everyone else is gone, but I think those are the people that should take a deep breath, and those are the people that should feel immune.”Deitsch responded, according to his sources at ESPN, “If you are part of the SportsCenter unit right now but not one of the special talents where management has tapped on the shoulder and given the golden ticket, if I were one of those people I would be talking to my agent and my representation of how management thinks of me.”Both Deitsch and Miller agreed that the most popular sportscasters will keep their jobs, however, they might be subject to substantial pay cuts.Breitbart Sports, ESPN

As analysts routinely point out, North Korea would be extremely difficult to invade, and its conventional arsenal could wreak enormous loss of life and economic damage on South Korea, even if it cannot yet field nuclear-tipped ICBMs.The Hill notes that the Trump administration has been considering further sanctions against Pyongyang, “placing diplomatic and economic pressure specifically focused on Chinese banks conducting business with North Korea.”National Security, James Mattis, missile tests, North Korea, nuclear weapons, Rex Tillerson, Sanctions








by John Carney31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe process of naming a new general counsel is complicated by widespread expectations that current Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will not be reappointed by President Donald Trump after her term expires in 2018, according to people familiar with the situation.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“No one wants to take the job of being ‘Janet Yellen’s lawyer’ only to be shown the door when Trump appoints a Trump-y chair,” said a Federal Reserve official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Alvarez’s retirement will bring an end to his 36-year career at the central bank. He has been general counsel for the last 12 years, guiding the Fed through the financial crisis and the implementation of the regulations stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.Although Alvarez’s tenure as general counsel spanned three different Fed chairs, it is widely expected inside the central bank that the next Fed chair could seek to reshuffle the senior staff as part of an effort to shift policy away from the post-crisis regulatory stance of Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke.“If you look at the administration’s executive orders on financial regulation, it’s clear that they intend to go in a new direction–and that will likely mean a lot of changes in places like the legal division,” according to a person familiar with the matter. As a result, the person said, the next general counsel may wind up serving a very short term.“A lot of people want the job–just not yet. The top people are gunning to be the replacement for Alvarev’s replacement,” another person at the central bank said.Big changes are afoot at the Fed. In addition to the coming retirement of Alvarez, Fed governor Dan Tarullo has announced he will retire as soon as next month. Tarullo has served as the de facto head of financial regulation at the Fed despite never being formally appointed as the Vice Chair for Supervision, a new position created by the Dodd Frank Act but never filled by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has not yet named a Vice Chair for Supervision or a successor for Tarullo.Big Government, Economics, Dan Tarullo, Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen








by Ian Mason31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe new program was unveiled at a Chicago City Council meeting on Wednesday, and it protects illegal aliens from federal oversight by not collecting any copies of identification documents presented when illegals apply for the identification card.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Applicants bring in the documents to prove someone’s identity. They hand them over to specially trained individual who can review the documents and then hand them back … It’s going to capture just the name and the date of birth. It’s not going to capture an address,” a source close to those officials told the Chicago Sun-Times.Emanuel, once President Barack Obama’s Chief of Staff, has been one of the loudest voices decrying Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s efforts to cut off federal funding for sanctuary cities like Chicago that refuse to cooperate in the enforcement of immigration laws.The “Municipal ID” plan is Emanuel’s latest bid to resist the effort of the Justice Department and remain what he has called a “welcoming city.” Emanuel’s new City Clerk Anna Valencia’s website describes the Municipal ID as “an optional, valid, government-issued ID that they can then use to access a range of services from both the private and public sectors. ”In addition to ensuring access for illegals to government programs, the Clerk’s Office also claims to be “working with cultural institutions, sports teams, pharmacies, local chambers of commerce and community organizations to explore potential discounts and partnerships.”The scheme is specifically designed not only to allow illegals to obtain the cards, but to avoid collecting data that could be used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to discover aliens in the country illegally. Chicago is apparently looking to a model pioneered in San Francisco to frustrate ICE efforts.“Applicants bring in the documents to prove someone’s identity. They hand them over to specially trained individual who can review the documents and then hand them back … It’s going to capture just the name and the date of birth. It’s not going to capture an address,” a source close to those officials told the Chicago Sun-Times.While city officials will make no effort to ascertain if recipients of the new ID are committing a crime by being in the United States, they will ensure that the gender with which they most strongly identify will be properly documented. “Applicants will also be able to self-designate their gender, which will be huge to the transgender and LGBTQ community. And it’s not just for undocumented individuals,” the same source said.The Sun-Times also reported that the Municipal ID program itself will cost Chicago taxpayers $1 million in its first year of implementation.Big Government, Immigration, Law Enforcement, Attorney General Jeff Session, Defund Sanctuary Cities, Mayor Rahm Emanuel








by AFP31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStockholm (AFP) – After months of controversy, Bob Dylan is in Stockholm to finally grab his Nobel literature prize in a meeting with the Swedish Academy, which awarded him for his poetry.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe first songwriter to receive the prestigious award, Dylan has joined the league of Nobel laureates including Thomas Mann, Albert Camus, Samuel Beckett, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Doris Lessing.At a secret time and place, the famously reclusive Dylan is to receive his Nobel diploma and medal in a closed meeting with the members of the Swedish Academy, which elects the winners of the literature prize.“The setting will be small and intimate, and no media will be present; only Bob Dylan and members of the Academy will attend, all according to Dylan’s wishes,” Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Academy said in a blog post.He is set to perform concerts on Saturday and Sunday in Stockholm, the first stop on a long-planned European tour.But the 75-year-old rock enigma will not give his traditional Nobel lecture during the meeting, the only requirement to receive the eight million kronor (836,000 euros, $895,000) that comes with the prize.“If you want something to go towards a certain direction, then he will go towards the opposite direction. This is what he’s done in his entire career,” Martin Nystrom, a music critic at the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter, told AFP.“He’s very unpredictable.”– New poetic expressions –The clock is ticking for Dylan who has until June 10 to deliver his lecture, which could be anything from a short speech to a performance, a video broadcast or even a song.Failing that he risks losing the prize money.“The Academy has reason to believe that a taped version will be sent at a later point,” Danius said, without specifying an exact date.The songwriter of “Blowin’ In The Wind”, “Hurricane” and  “Mr. Tambourine Man” was honoured “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition,” the Nobel committee said when the award was announced last October.“Not once have I ever had the time to ask myself, ‘Are my songs literature?’” Dylan said later in a thank-you speech read aloud by the US ambassador to Sweden during the December Nobel ceremony  in Stockholm, which he snubbed due to “pre-existing commitments”.The folk singer has been mentioned in Nobel speculation in past years, but was never seen as a serious contender.But Dylan cruised past prominent US novelists of his age range such as Don DeLillo and Philip Roth — to say nothing of late, quintessentially 1960s writers such as Jack Kerouac — to be the first American to win the award in more than two decades.– ‘I’m right here’-While Danius, a fervent Dylan fan, has defended her choice and that of her peers, Scottish writer Irvine Welsh, author of “Trainspotting”, mocked the prize “awarded by senile hippies”.Dylan kept silent for weeks after he was announced as the winner and when he was asked at the time why he did not respond to the Academy’s calls, he told the Daily Telegraph: “Well, I’m right here.”His mysterious reaction even provoked Academy member Per Wastberg to call him “impolite” and “arrogant”.Dylan later apologised for not being able to attend the ceremony and expressed surprise over being chosen as a laureate like authors Ernest Hemingway and Albert Camus.“If someone had ever told me that I had the slightest chance of winning the Nobel Prize, I would have to think that I’d have about the same odds as standing on the moon,” he added.Dylan’s anti-establishment rock star image may seem at odds with the Nobel’s prestige, at least in the eyes of hard-core fans, according to Mikael Timm, a culture reporter at the public Swedish Radio.“Old nerds think this is the case because they want him to be anti-establishment,” Timm told AFP.“It’s been a while since he was politically active,” he added.Armed with a harmonica and an acoustic guitar, Dylan confronted social injustice, war and racism, and recording an astonishing 300 songs in his first three years.








by Charles Hurt31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSince President Trump first leveled the incendiary charges in early March, there have been thousands of press articles and endless hours of speculation on cable television about the high-level accusations.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEREvery word, character, and symbol of punctuation from Mr. Trump has been parsed and sussed and diagrammed.This is no small thing we are talking about here. We are talking about a sitting president’s administration using the terrifying powers of espionage of the United States government to conduct an intelligence operation against a political opponent before, during and after that target was elected president of the United States.So much for “peaceful transfer of power.”This would be 10 times more serious than Watergate. We are talking a constitutional crisis the likes of which we have never seen in modern times.And all anybody around here seems to want to talk about is the exhaustively investigated — yet still unsubstantiated — conspiracy theories about Mr. Trump’s supposed ties to Russia.Well, what about Mr. Obama? Did he actually morph into Russian President Vladimir Putin himself? Did he turn the White House into the Kremlin?Those are much graver charges than whether somebody has “ties” to the Russians. And so many of the questions about Mr. Obama’s involvement in spying on his political enemy remain unanswered.Actually, they remain unasked at this point.And before you dismiss these questions as crazy tweets from a crazy dictator, remember that Mr. Trump’s national security adviser was fired after he was — indisputably — wiretapped and unmasked during the time he was serving on Mr. Trump’s transition team. This alone would be utterly unbelievable in a world before Oliver Stone’s movie “Snowden.”So, what say you, Mr. Obama?Crickets.The only statement from Mr. Obama was a carefully worded non-denial issued by a spokesman.“A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,” the statement began.This would seem to merely confirm that Mr. Trump was being investigated by the Obama Administration — but that Mr. Obama’s fingerprints would not be found anywhere on that investigation.And, yes, this is the same corrupt administration that featured the attorney general meeting in a private plane on a tarmac with the husband of the woman who was supposed to be Mr. Obama’s successor — while she was under investigation by the FBI.The Obama spokesman’s statement went on to say: “As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.”Here again, they are playing a silly game. Instead of answering the real question, they are hiding behind the loose and imprecise language of Mr. Trump’s tweet where he shorthands the whole accusation in less than 140 digits by saying “Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower.”Any logical human knows what Mr. Trump meant by this. I don’t think any serious person actually thought Mr. Obama himself in a hard hat and work gloves with wire snips was in the walls at Trump Tower twisting wires together.Obviously, Mr. Trump meant that he and his campaign and transition team had been spied upon by U.S. intelligence services at the behest of — or with knowledge of — the sitting U.S. president.Monumental charges. Yet no denial from the former president.On Mr. Obama’s Twitter feed, he has opined about Chuck Berry, International Women’s Day and even Valentine’s Day. But not a peep about the serious charges lodged against him.This, at a time when we are told that Mr. Obama plans to lead the political resistance against Mr. Trump. He should begin by “resisting” these charges.• Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.Big Government, barack obama, Donald Trump








by Breitbart News31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom Strassel’s Wall Street Journal column:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWe’ve known since early February that a call by former national security adviser Mike Flynn to the Russian ambassador was monitored by U.S. intelligence. There’s nothing improper in tapping foreign officials. But it was improper that Mr. Flynn’s name was revealed and leaked to the press, along with the substance of his conversation. The media nonetheless excused all this by claiming one piece of Mr. Flynn’s conversation (sanctions) was relevant to the continuing investigation into Trump-Russia ties.Around the same time, Mr. Nunes’s own intelligence sources informed him that documents showed further collection of information about, and unmasking of, Trump transition officials. These documents aren’t easily obtainable, since they aren’t the “finished” intelligence products that Congress gets to see. Nonetheless, for weeks Mr. Nunes has been demanding intelligence agencies turn over said documents—with no luck, so far.Mr. Nunes earlier this week got his own source to show him a treasure trove of documents at a secure facility. Here are the relevant details:First, there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials. Second, the information these documents contained was not related to Russia. Third, while many reports did “mask” identities (referring, for instance, to “U.S. Person 1 or 2”) they were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed. Fourth, in at least one instance, a Trump official other than Mr. Flynn was outright unmasked. Finally, these documents were circulated at the highest levels of government.To sum up, Team Obama was spying broadly on the incoming administration.Read the rest here.

by Michael Patrick Leahy30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDepartment of Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth, an Obama appointee, is treating the February 24 leak of a draft DHS document central to the separate decisions by two federal judges revoking President Trump’s travel ban on March 15 differently than he did the April 2, 2015 unauthorized leak of private information about Rep. Jason Chaffetz from the employment files of the Secret Service.One day after the Chaffetz leak, DHS announced an OIG investigation. More than one month after the leak of the draft DHS document, published in a February 24 Associated Press story written by Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell, DHS is silent as to whether an investigation has been or will be launched.On April 2, 2015, the Daily Beast reported that “House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who oversees the Secret Service, never disclosed that he had applied for and was rejected from the agency in the early 2000s,” in an article written by reporter Tim Mak.Mak did not disclose in the article how he first learned of Chaffetz’s application to the Secret Service, which has been a part of the Department of Homeland Security since 2003.One day later, on April 3, 2015 CNN reported, “Senior staff from the House committee that oversees the Secret Service have asked the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General to look into allegations that U.S. Secret Service employees circulated private personnel information about committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz.”“Chaffetz’s office confirmed that the House Oversight Committee chairman applied unsuccessfully to a job with the Secret Service in 2003,” CNN reported, adding:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Secret Service referred CNN to the investigation being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General as to whether any policies were violated.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson apologized to Chaffetz in a phone call Thursday night for the congressman “being put in the situation that he had to acknowledge a matter that should have been kept confidential,” according to DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron.Johnson also called for an investigation into the matter, Catron said.“We conducted this investigation from April 2, 2015 to August 21, 2015,” the final report, “Investigation into the Improper Access and Distribution of Information Contained Within a Secret Service Data System,” made public on September 25, 2015 by DHS Inspector General John Roth—an Obama appointee who has held over into the Trump administration—noted.DHS Inspector General Roth’s quick pursuit of an investigation into the unauthorized leak of Congressman Chaffetz’s employment application to the Secret Service stands in stark contrast to his silence, and the department’s silence, on its reaction to the unauthorized leak of a draft DHS document, published in a February 24 AP story written by Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell, that was cited as key evidence in the separate decisions by two federal judges on March 15 to revoke President Trump’s travel ban.“As a matter of policy, DHS neither confirms nor denies the potential existence of ongoing investigations,” DHS spokesperson Gillian Christensen tells Breitbart News.While that silence on “the potential existence of ongoing investigations” may be the current policy, it was apparently not the department’s policy on April 3, 2015 when a spokesperson for the Secret Service confirmed the existence of a DHS OIG investigation into the Secret Service leak about Rep. Chaffetz.Nor does that policy appear to apply to a recent highly publicized DHS OIG investigation related to the implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order 13769—the initial temporary travel bans for citizens of seven Middle Eastern countries–Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Iraq (the only one of the seven countries not included in the subsequent Executive Order 13780).On February 1, four days after President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, “The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG) announced that it will review DHS’ implementation of the recent Executive Order,“Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.” The review is being initiated in response to congressional request and whistleblower and hotline complaints:In addition to reviewing the implementation of the Executive Order, the OIG will review DHS’ adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct on the part of DHS personnel. If circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.The leaked draft DHS document published in the February 24 AP story was three pages in total, and had no letterhead nor any other markings to indicate it originated in the DHS, nor did it bear the name or signature of any current DHS employee. The authors of the story, however, asserted that it originated within the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, an assertion not disputed by a spokesperson for DHS, who did note, however, that it was an “incomplete” and “draft” document and not an authorized official position of DHS.The leaked document did however, cite another DHS document in an end note as the source of the data described within it, ” DHS I&A Terrorism-Related Activities Study: 16 FEB 17; DOI 01 Mar 11 – 31 Jan 17; DHS I&A Terrorism-Related Activities Study.”Breitbart News asked DHS to obtain a copy of this document, as well as a description of its classification status, but did not receive a response to that request.Information about the classification status of that cited document may play a key role in determining the potential level of criminality involved in the leaking of the draft document. If, for instance, it is a classified document, federal laws have clearly been broken. If it is “classified but sensitive,” federal laws have likely been broken. If it is completely unclassified, prosecutors would have a more difficult time proving violation of federal laws, but the leak would certainly be cause for termination at DHS.“Generally speaking, DHS employees are held to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct. Any allegations of misconduct are taken seriously and addressed appropriately,” Christensen adds.In the case of the unauthorized leak of Rep. Chaffetz’s employment application, those allegations were addressed more than a year later, on May 27, 2016, when Homeland Security Security Jeh Johnson announced, “The U.S. Secret Service has punished 41 employees in the improper access and leak of House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz’s personnel files during his committee’s investigation of the beleaguered agency,” as Law 360 reported.Johnson’s statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service, referenced a September DHS Office of Inspector General report that found records from the Utah Republican’s 2003 application with the agency were accessed around 60 times. From there the decision was one of accountability, Johnson said, with the conduct of 57 Secret Service staff reviewed, and 41 of those being punished.“This discipline includes a letter of reprimand to one individual, suspended discipline contingent on no further misconduct for a period of five years, and suspensions from duty without pay for periods of up to 45 days,” Johnson said. “The one individual found by the Inspector General to have disclosed the private information to an outside source, the Washington Post, has resigned from the Secret Service. I found no basis to take any action with respect to the Director or Deputy Director.”The apparent lack of curiosity displayed by the DHS Inspector General as to the origins of the leaked draft DHS document that played such a central role in the constitutionally significant decisions made separately by Judge Derrick Watson of the U.S. District Court of Hawaii and Judge Theodore Chuang of the U.S. District Court of Maryland on March 15, revoking President Trump’s Executive Order 13780, raises further questions about the conduct of the federal bureaucrats in the new Trump administration.“Democrats own the Deep State, that network of embedded bureaucrats, academics and media, judicial activists, and spooks that is operating to stymie, discredit, and ultimately remove from office a president that is a threat to their mutual agenda. They are agreed that government should control more of life’s essential functions, and that benign rule of the enlightened can reshape society to match their visions,” Thomas Lifson writes at American Thinker about this leak.“The draft report [leaked to the Associated Press and published on February 24] came from DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which was headed by David Grannis, an Obama holdover bureaucrat. Grannis is a partisan Democrat who previously worked as a staffer for Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Jane Harman. A DHS spokesman “would neither confirm nor deny that Grannis was the author of, or had reviewed, the leaked document….” ” John Hinderaker writes at Powerline Blog:How about the reporters? It pretty much goes without saying that AP reporters are Democrats. But Leahy also points out [in a March 27 article at Breitbart] that Vivian Salama formerly worked for Rolling Stone, where she wrote that Yemen–one of the countries covered by the travel order–“holds a special place in my heart.” She has bitterly denounced U.S. drone strikes in Yemen.So it appears that what happened here is that Democratic Party activists in the Department of Homeland Security either created a bogus document or dug up a poorly-researched draft document that had never been issued, and fed it to Democratic Party activists at the Associated Press. The Democratic Party activists at the AP published a story based on the anonymous document, which two Democratic Party activists on the bench used as a pretext for orders enjoining the president’s travel order.Those orders should be viewed as purely political acts that have no basis in any valid judicial reasoning or authority.“I suspect that we will see many more examples of the Deep State in action because we are getting more aware of them, as they are getting more desperate, careless, and self-contradictory. Naming it, defining it, and documenting it are important aspects of the fight against it. The Deep State does not like the light for good reasons,” American Thinker’s Lifson concludes.DHS Inspector General Roth’s conduct of the office’s earlier investigation into the Secret Service leak was questioned in a September 28, 2015 Washington Post article written by Jerry Markon.“John Roth is the top watchdog at the Department of Homeland Security, a position shielded by law from outside pressure so he can conduct independent inquiries of the government’s sensitive internal workings,” the Post reported.But during a nearly completed investigation of the Secret Service, Roth’s office has taken the unorthodox step of allowing officials from the service to work alongside his agents as they tried to determine how unflattering information about a congressman was disclosed from the agency’s files, according to half a dozen people familiar with the inquiry.Legal experts and former government investigators said the approach threatens the integrity of the investigation of who at the Secret Service uncovered and leaked material showing that Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) — chairman of a House committee overseeing the agency — had once been rejected for a job as an agent. Chaffetz has been an outspoken critic of the Secret Service, which has been rocked recently by high-profile security breaches.Secret Service staff members — inspectors from the agency’s internal affairs office who examine possible misconduct among employees — sat in on interviews with some of the more than 40 agents and officers questioned about the unauthorized disclosures, the people said. In some cases, the Secret Service inspectors contacted witnesses directly and questioned them along with investigators from the DHS Inspector General’s Office headed by Roth, who is responsible for examining alleged wrongdoing across the breadth of Homeland Security.“In one instance, Roth’s agents and Secret Service inspectors jointly questioned an agent about Carol D. Leonnig, a reporter for The Washington Post who has uncovered security missteps by the service, according to the agent’s attorney. Investigators asked about stories related to Chaffetz and other subjects and confronted the agent with his personal cellphone records, showing alleged calls and texts with Leonnig, the lawyer said,” the Post noted:The service’s involvement in investigating itself is problematic, experts say, because top officials at the agency had an incentive to embarrass Chaffetz. The participation of the service’s inspectors also could deter internal whistleblowers from coming forward with additional allegations of misconduct for fear of retribution by their bosses, the experts said.You just don’t do it. You don’t have the agency you’re investigating involved in the investigation,’’ said Eric Feldman, who held high-level posts in inspector general’s offices at four federal agencies in Democratic and Republican administrations and now advises companies on ethics. “That’s why you have an independent inspector general: to avoid the potential for conflict.’’The agent’s cellphone records were obtained through an administrative subpoena issued by the DHS inspector general, people familiar with the probe said. Such subpoenas are a device that lawyers and former government officials say federal agencies increasingly use to force people and companies to turn over personal records and other documents without the prior approval of a judge.Breitbart News asked Department of Justice if it intended to launch its own investigation into the leak of the draft DHS document, but has not received a response.“There are laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of classified materials and a process by which agencies can report unauthorized disclosures to the Department of Justice,” the FBI spokesperson tells Breitbart News.“You should direct your questions to DHS to determine whether such a disclosure has occurred. Typically, documents would contain portion markings indicating classification,” the spokesperson said.“Ethics or policy violations would also be reviewed by the appropriate office within DHS, not the FBI,” the spokesperson added.Big Government, American Thinker, Daily Beast, DHS I&A Terrorism-Related Activities Study: 16 FEB 17; DOI 01 Mar 11 - 31 Jan 17; DHS I&A Terrorism-Related Activities Study, DHS Inspector General John Roth, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, Executive Order 13769, Executive Order 13780, John Hinderaker, Judge Derrick Watson, Judge Theodore Chuang, Powerline Blog, Rep.

by Joel B. Pollak30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCertainly it has its day-to-day frustrations, especially for Sean Spicer, who has to face the press corps and its obsession with meaningless minutiae.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut the joke is on the journalists. They are spending so much time on the non-story that they are missing what President Donald Trump is actually doing. He complains on Twitter about the coverage, but the truth is that the distraction is very useful.The “scandal” is no longer about Russia. Now it is about how House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) found information backing up Trump’s claims that his team was under surveillance by the Obama administration.Was Nunes approached by whistleblowers who came to his congressional office? Or were the whistleblowers sent by the White House to Nunes? It makes no difference at all, but the media think they are onto something very important.CNN called it a “cover-up,” without specifying what, exactly, Nunes was supposed to be “covering up.” And the answer is: nothing.Even if — for argument’s sake — the White House had approached Nunes rather than the other way around, the worst that could be said about it is that Nunes behaved like a partisan Republican. If so, he is no more partisan than ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who is abusing his position to launch conspiracy theories against the GOP.The core of Schiff’s case, as presented at the House Intelligence Committee last Monday, is a lie — namely, the false claim that the Republican Party altered its platform at the behest of Trump aides in order to appease the Russians. As Byron York of the Washington Examiner has demonstrated, the Republican platform was “was actually strengthened, not weakened” against Russia.Schiff is still pretending that some other evidence will emerge on Trump-Russia ties. But the idea Russia colluded with the Trump campaign is ludicrous, for three reasons.The first is there is no evidence whatsoever to support that claim. Obama’s own James Clapper and Mike Morell even said so — though it took Trump’s tweets about “wiretapping” to flush them out of hiding.Second, the Russians could not have known that Trump would win, and would not have targeted Clinton alone when it seemed that she could exact punishment once she took office.The third reason is that Hillary Rodham Clinton was arguably the most pro-Russian official since Alger Hiss. From the Russian “reset,” to giving up missile defense, to the one-sided New START treaty, to the uranium giveaway, to the loss of the Middle East, and to the loss of the Crimea (which happened on her successor’s watch, while she remained silent), Clinton ran the State Department almost like a post-Soviet satellite.Indeed, if Donald Trump really wanted to appease Russian President Vladimir Putin, it would be hard to find anything left with which to appease him. The Russians saw Trump’s criticism of NATO as useful, and applauded him. But they likely preferred Clinton.Already, Trump has been much tougher on Russia than Obama ever was. From blasting Russia at the UN Security Council over the eastern Ukraine, to threatening to tear up the New START treaty, Trump has opposed Putin — and it shows. Trump foreign policy adviser Sebastian Gorka, formerly of Breitbart News, is also a vociferous critic of Russia.So the Russia “scandal” is much ado about nothing. But it keeps the media distracted from what Trump is really doing — such as taking a chainsaw to Obama’s regulations — and it keeps the Democrats from developing an actual message.The beauty of it all? Aside from Trump’s tweets, the media and the Democrats are creating this distraction themselves.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Trump’s opponents seized on the case to counter his claims to business success, as well as to paint him as untrustworthy, given allegations by former students that they had paid for real estate instruction that they never properly received.Then, in early 2016, then-candidate Trump suggested that Judge Curiel could be biased against him because of his Mexican heritage. Critics argued that his remark was bigoted — though some who defended his remark noted the left’s double standard in embracing the idea that a liberal judge might rule on the basis of ethnic identity. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor had previously said: “I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life.”During the campaign, Trump had suggested that he would not settle the case, arguing that it was without merit, but after winning the election he agreed to the terms of the settlement just before the trial phase of the litigation was to begin.Lawyers for the plaintiff appeared pleased at a press conference. They had worked pro bono — for free — in taking the case.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He was named one of the “most influential” people in news media in 2016.

by AFP29 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERShanghai (AFP) – Poodles in pink dresses, Pekinese wearing blouses, a Pomeranian in sneakers and a raincoat — Shanghai’s sidewalks can sometimes seem like fashion catwalks gone to the dogs.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERChinese adore their pet canines, often dressing them up in eye-catching outfits, and nowhere are such furry fashionistas more conspicuous than in China’s commercial hub.“Pet owners like to dress up their pets, the way they would their own children,” said a woman surnamed Huang as she walked her two fluffy brown poodles, one with a pink bowtie and the other wearing a blue one, through a central Shanghai neighbourhood.Or rather they walked her — riding in a baby stroller as Huang pushed.It’s big business too.At least 40 percent of pet merchants in China sell pet clothing, according to Yourpet Market Research Institute, which studies the country’s huge pet industry.The industry overall generates sales of around $17 billion per year and is expected to grow by 20 percent annually, it said in a report last year.“Millennials are becoming the main customers with their consumer power growing,” it said.Zhang Jiequn, a psychologist at Shanghai’s Huada Institute of Applied Psychology, said that for many Chinese, pet ownership “is a kind of escape from interpersonal relationships.”“The pet becomes a projection of the opposite sex for some people who do not find a partner,” she told AFP. Dog ownership rates have grown along with China’s fast-expanding middle class. A 2015 survey cited by the state-run China Daily said there were at least 100 million registered pets in China, with dogs making up the vast majority, and that pet ownership was growing by 10 percent annually. Shanghai — which has 24 million people — also has an estimated pet dog population of up to one million.The high rate of dog ownership prompted the city in 2011 to impose a “one-dog policy” — limiting owners to a single canine — to curb noisy barking, waste on sidewalks and dog attacks.








by AFP30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTokyo (AFP) – A Japanese whaling fleet returned to port Friday after an annual Antarctic hunt that killed more than 300 of the mammals as Tokyo pursues the programme in defiance of global criticism.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe fleet set sail for the Southern Ocean in November, with plans to slaughter 333 minke whales, flouting a worldwide moratorium and opposition led by Australia and New Zealand.The fleet consisted of five ships, three of which arrived in the morning at Shimonoseki port in western Japan, the country’s Fisheries Agency said.More than 200 people, including crew members and their families, gathered in the rain for a 30-minute ceremony in front of the Nisshin Maru, the fleet’s main ship, according to an official of the Shimonoseki City government.In a press release, the agency described the mission as “research for the purpose of studying the ecological system in the Antarctic Sea”.But environmentalists and the International Court of Justice (IJC) call that a fiction and say the real purpose is simply to hunt whales for their meat.Anticipating the fleet’s return, animal protection charity Humane Society International called for an end to Japanese whaling. “Each year that Japan persists with its discredited scientific whaling is another year where these wonderful animals are needlessly sacrificed,” said Kitty Block, the group’s executive vice president.“It is an obscene cruelty in the name of science that must end,” she said in a release.– Research claims –Japan also caught 333 minke whales in the previous season ending in 2016 after a one-year hiatus prompted by an IJC ruling, which said the hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as science and ordered Tokyo to end it.Under the International Whaling Commission (IWC), to which Japan is a signatory, there has been a moratorium on hunting whales since 1986.Tokyo exploits a loophole allowing whales to be killed for “scientific research” and claims it is trying to prove the population is large enough to sustain a return to commercial hunting.But it also makes no secret of the fact that whale meat ends up on dinner tables and is served up in school lunches.Japan has hunted whales for centuries, and their meat was a key source of protein in the immediate post-World War II years when the country was desperately poor.But consumption has dramatically declined in recent decades, with significant proportions of the population saying they “never” or “rarely” eat whale meat.In response to the ICJ ruling, Japan’s 2014-15 mission carried out only “non-lethal research” such as taking skin samples and doing headcounts.Past missions have been hampered by a confrontational campaign on the high seas by environmentalists Sea Shepherd, though Japan has won some relief from the group through the courts.A fisheries agency official said that the whalers this time faced “no obstructive behaviour threatening safety of the fleet and crew members” by the group.He attributed that partially to Japan having started dispatching fisheries agency patrol ships to protect the fleet. 








by Pam Key31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFriday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” NBC’s “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd said President Donald Trump must accept “the fact” that Russia interfered in this election or he will be “on the brink of becoming a temporary lame duck presidency.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTodd said, “You have a presidency right now that I think is, it’s beyond saying it’s in crisis mode, it’s, you know, it’s on the brink, the question is on the brink of what? Is it on the brink of collapse? Is it on the brink of becoming a temporary lame duck presidency? Maybe it feels lame-duckish temporarily right now. You’ve got a stalled agenda. Republicans who have no fear of this president right now. They don’t think there’s a political penalty to buck him. Obviously, the Russia cloud darkens all of the time, and all of these problems right now that they’re dealing with front and center are self-inflicted by one person, the president of the United States who could not help himself with a tweet on this wiretapping nonsense.”“That essentially helped unravel ten days of all things Russia in their part of this story,” he continued. “Then throw in the fact that he has decided to drive a wedge in his own party by going after the Freedom Caucus. Okay, but he also attacking Democrats at the same time. He has to go find a dance partner and he is alienating both of his potential dance partners on that front. On the normal political scale, he has problems. Throw in the fact that you have a president that cannot accept the fact that Russia interfered in this election. Until he accepts that fact, it will plague him.

by Neil Munro30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe “House Freedom Caucus members held the line, and the data show that is precisely what their constituents wanted,” he wrote in a report, titled “Analytics shows HFC saved GOP on Health Care.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert predicted any approval of Ryan’s healthcare overhaul would wreck the GOP’s House majority in 2018. “This bill is going to ultimately result in Republicans losing the majority … [and] If we pass a bill that doesn’t bring down premiums and give the American people hope, and not give more power to the government … then we will deserve to be voted out,” he said in a speech on the House floor, according to TheHill.  “While full repeal and replace of Obamacare has overwhelming support in these districts, even keeping Obamacare intact was more popular than the AHCA, often by more than a two-to-one margin,” said Wilson, who managed Sen. Ted Cruz’s voter analysis and tracking efforts in 2016. The same analysis was applied to 2018 Senate races and concluded that “the House Freedom Caucus did … Republicans’ hopes of expanding their Senate majority, a great service in stopping the [Ryancare] bill before it made it across the Capitol,” Wilson wrote.But Wilson’s analysis also shows strong public support for an alternative repeal-and-replace “plan that allows for the sale of insurance across state lines, expands Health Savings Accounts, incentivizes states to create high-risk pools, block grants Medicaid, and is portable so it can be taken from job to job.”Wilson’s analysis is based a huge national survey, which allows his group to understand the preference of each population subgroup. For example, voters are asked three questions about each issue, he said. Typically, one question is skewed from a left-wing perspective, one question is skewed from the right, and the third question is intended to be unbiased, he said.In turn, the team then used three voter-response models to predict preferences among each politicians’ particular subgroups of voters. In this survey, the models were used to gauge each district’s’ voters preference for three healthcare options — continuing Obamacare, establishing Ryan’s “Ryancare” replacement, and the third option, “Repeal and replace.”Subsequently, the analysts spend much time check and rechecking the accuracy of the voter-response models in each district, he said, adding “you’ve got to spend time double-checking,”Politicians are increasingly using this style of voter analysis to understand their constituents, amid constant pressure from lobbyists and donors, he said. In the healthcare analysis, Wilson said he didn’t try to gauge why the voters approved or rejected each of the three policy options. “I don’t have the ability to discern or divine the reason why the voters answered as they did… that’s the next stage” of development, he added.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017Limbaugh mentioned a Politico story describing the House Freedom Caucus leadership as “ringleaders” before saying there was a better way to handle the House Freedom Caucus than calling them out on Twitter.“Now, to this health care business. As I mentioned earlier today, the president has doubled down on the Freedom Caucus, the 30 or so members of the conservative members of the House of Representatives, The Politico and such others in their headline are referring to the three Freedom Caucus leaders as the ringleaders, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Raul Labrador. The ringleaders? What do you associate ringleaders with? Ringleaders — crime, gangs,” he said. “Exactly right. Bank robbers. The ringleaders of the group were hiding in the getaway car parked one block down the street.”“So now these guys are being characterized as ringleaders of some gang, some out-of-control gang in the House, and Trump has doubled down on it,” Limbaugh continued. “Look, folks, calling them out like this, I know it’s Trump’s technique; I know it’s Trump’s method. But there’s a better way of doing this. These guys are not the enemy. The Democrats are the enemy. The Freedom Caucus has actually made a pretty big move here.”Limbaugh went on to cite a Washington Examiner editorial calling the Freedom Caucus’ conditions reasonable and urging the White House, House Speaker Paul Ryan and congressional GOP centrists to accept those conditions.“That’s the problem with the first effort: It didn’t kill the law,” Limbaugh said. “It sustained much of it and then put in the hands of the secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, the responsibility of removing a bunch of things from it. And the Freedom Caucus said, ‘We’re not really getting rid of it, if we’re just letting the secretary remove it and nothing else happens, then the next time the Democrats win they can put those things back in. We need to take them out by statute.'”“But it’s clear that the objective here was to get a win,” he added. “The objective was to really knock it out of the park in the first two months, fulfill a campaign promise, say that Obamacare had been repealed and the replace effort was underway, first phase of three. But the ringleaders of the Conservative Caucus were suspicious that this was not gonna end Obamacare, and they had campaigned promising to do so.”Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBreitbart TV, Obamacare, freedom caucus, obamacare, Rush Limbaugh








by Lucas Nolan31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWikiLeaks released the “Marble Framework” leak today on their website, describing Marble as a tool used to “hamper forensic investigators and anti-virus companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Marble does this by hiding (‘obfuscating’) text fragments used in CIA malware from visual inspection,” WikiLeaks claims. “This is the digital equivalent of a specialized CIA tool to place covers over the english language text on U.S. produced weapons systems before giving them to insurgents secretly backed by the CIA.”Marble is reportedly an obfuscation tool that is not used as a cyber attack itself but to hide and cover up previous attacks. WikiLeaks claims it is part of the CIA’s anti-forensics approach and the CIA’s core library of cyber attacks and viruses, “Designed to allow for flexible and easy-to-use obfuscation” as “string obfuscation algorithms (especially those that are unique) are often used to link malware to a specific developer or development shop.”The source code also reportedly contains a deobfuscator used to reverse CIA text obfuscation. WikiLeaks believes that with the framework now made public, forensic investigators should be able to notice patterns and signatures which can be followed to attribute previous cyber attacks and viruses to the CIA.WikiLeaks also believes that Marble could be used to attribute cyber attacks to multiple countries due to evidence of Marble test examples in English, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic, and Farsi. WikiLeaks states, “This would permit a forensic attribution double game, for example by pretending that the spoken language of the malware creator was not American English, but Chinese, but then showing attempts to conceal the use of Chinese, drawing forensic investigators even more strongly to the wrong conclusion, — but there are other possibilities, such as hiding fake error messages.”Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

In addition, universities pay no tax on investments gains on their endowments.Spokespeople for the various Ivy League institutions defended the state funding.“Since 2000, over 50 startups based on Yale inventions and located in New Haven have attracted over $5 billion in investment to New Haven and surrounding towns,” Tom Conroy, a Yale spokesman, said. “Alexion, which employs 1,200 people in New Haven, is a prime example of Yale’s impact.”A statement from Princeton University attempted to justify the funding by explaining that it finances libraries, laboratories, classrooms, research and financial aid.Lawrence Reed, the President of the Foundation for Economic Education, shared the report on his Facebook page, asking “I wonder how that might have affected their ideological diversity?”Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

by Ian Mason31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Judge Gorsuch is incredibly qualified, he has a sterling record, he was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals,” the President said, making his case to the nation as a showdown over Senate cloture rules draws closer. “Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is about more than his incredible qualifications. It’s about preserving our republic,” he continued.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Senate fight over confirming Gorsuch has reached a fever-pitch over the last week, with the two parties running out of room for compromise. As the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans have signaled their willingness to confirm Gorsuch by any means necessary, increasing numbers of Democrats have insisted they will filibuster any attempt to allow an up-or-down vote on the nominee, making it ever more likely Republicans will move to change Senate rules to allow a simple majority to close debate on Supreme Court nominees.Democrats, who under current rules need only forty-one votes to block a vote on Gorsuch, themselves used the “constitutional option” to allow simple majority confirmations for non-Supreme Court nominees in 2013. Four more Senate Democrats, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV), and Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), confirmed Friday they will move to filibuster and force the constitutional option.Senate Democrats are finding themselves under immense pressure to close ranks for this unprecedented filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, first called for by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) last week. Friday, CREDO, a left-wing “super-PAC,” and a bevy of other progressive activist groups put their names to a letter to be delivered to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee demanding any Democratic Senator who fails to join the filibuster against Gorsuch be stripped of all funding from the national Democratic Party apparatus. “Democrats who refuse to defend the Supreme Court from Donald Trump’s racist, fascist agenda should not receive support for their re-election,” CREDO told supporters on its website.Only nine Democratic and independent Senators remain who have yet to announce their intentions on the Gorsuch Confirmation, by Breitbart New’s count. In order to confirm Gorsuch without changing traditional Senate rules, six of these would need to join the chamber’s fifty-two Republicans and Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Democrats who have expressed their support for Gorsuch.Republicans have responded with more open insistence that they will do whatever it takes to confirm Gorsuch. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), in a CNN op-ed urging his Democratic colleagues to reconsider their filibuster, was unequivocal. “Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice. The question is whether Democrats will give him the up-or-down vote he deserves,” he wrote.Even Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who had as recently as Thursday held out hope a compromise might be reached to preserve the Senate’s traditional cloture rules, walked back from reports of a “deal” Friday. “I’ve had conversations with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. That’s all. There’s no gang. There’s no negotiations. Just having some conversations. No deal. No negotiations,” he told the Daily Caller.Gorsuch’s confirmation vote is now set for April 7.Big Government, Brian Schatz, CREDO, Donald Trump, Judge Neil Gorsuch, Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, Sen.

The survey includes 13,000 manufacturing members of the association,SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe news marked a 20-year record high for the survey, prompting Trump to claim a “new surge of optimism” for more jobs in the United States, thanks to many of his policies.Jay Timmons, of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that the optimism centered on Trump’s focus on lowering taxes, cutting regulations, and investing in infrastructure. The survey also showed a jump from 26 percent of members saying that the country was on the right track before the inauguration to over 60 percent in the new survey.“We appreciate your committment to investment and job creation in manufacturing and we’re going to deliver,” Timmons said.Several leaders of American manufacturers joined Trump for the event, highlighting the jobs they had created in the United States.“We’re removing job-killing regulations and lifting the burdens on American industry, like I would say have never been lifted before,” Trump said.He noted that a lot of manufacturing jobs had been moved to places like Mexico and China. Trump previewed his upcoming meeting with the President of China at his estate in Mar-a-lago.“It’s going to be something, I think, very important, very special, I look very much forward to meeting him and the delegation and we’ll see what happens,” he said.Big Government








by Matthew Boyle31 Mar 2017Washington, D.C. 0SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWalsh was suspected of being a leaker, White House sources tell Breitbart News. They specifically say that a story first reported on Charles Johnson’s Got News weeks ago led to her ultimate demise. Walsh has been reassigned to an outside organization to support the Trump agenda, and White House senior officials presented the news on Thursday as a reassignment, not a termination.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut two sources with direct knowledge of these matters—one inside the White House and one outside—told Breitbart News on Thursday that it was Walsh’s suspected leaking that led to her removal.In fact, the Washington Post’s White House bureau chief Philip Rucker even reported that White House staff were calling Walsh a Priebus loyalist and “leaky vessel.”Inside White House, some officials saw Katie Walsh as "a leaky vessel," per source. Loyal to Priebus, but viewed suspiciously by others.— Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) March 30, 2017Now, there are four names—according to Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs—being discussed as a replacement to Walsh in the deputy chief of staff position. Rick Dearborn, the deputy chief for legislative affairs right now who previously served as chief of staff to now-Attorney General, then-U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, is the leading candidate for the position, White House sources say.But the other three names being considered, per Jacobs, bring serious levels of concern. One is another ex-Republican National Committee (RNC) Reince Priebus loyalist—Sean Cairncross—who a White House senior aide described to Breitbart News as absolutely being a leaker from inside the White House, just like Walsh. Cairncross, who served alongside Priebus in the senior-most levels of the RNC, has been systemically leaking information designed to help Priebus and hurt Priebus’s rivals inside the White House, a senior official tells Breitbart News. Senior administration officials have been aware of Cairncross’ leaking behavior, too, and have been watching him closely. An ex-RNC aide who served alongside Cairncross in Priebus’s old shop confirmed to Breitbart News, too, that Cairncross had a history of leaking information from the RNC, potentially at the direction of somebody higher than him. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has not responded to Breitbart News questions about Cairncross’s alleged leaking. NEW: 4 being considered to replace Katie Walsh as deputy chief of staff: Rick Dearborn, Marc Short, Sean Cairncross, Joe Hagin, I'm told.— Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) March 31, 2017As for Marc Short, a loyalist of Vice President Mike Pence and Joe Hagin, there are concerns as to whether he can perform the duties necessary in the position Walsh is vacating. Short currently runs White House operations and is described by Trump’s people as very capable at that job.If Dearborn gets the position, as he is expected to per multiple White House aides, then there is discussion of bringing in David Urban to fill the position Dearborn will be vacating to replace Walsh. Urban, an ex-chief of staff in the U.S. Senate to the late Arlen Specter, is a Trump loyalist who was crucial to his win in the state of Pennsylvania. “Dearborn and Urban getting these jobs would be a win for the home team,” a White House official told Breitbart News.Sources say both David Urban & Rick Dearborn among names being considered to replace Katie Walsh as WH Deputy Chief of Staff.— Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) March 31, 2017Having two former U.S. Senate chiefs of staff with deep experience and connections on Capitol Hill—who are actually loyal to the president and support implementation of his ideas and agenda, not the ideas and agenda of other anti-Trump Republicans—could patch up many of the organizational issues on the inside.NEW: Sources tell me WH considering David Urban to become Deputy Chief of Staff for Legislative Affairs to replace Rick Dearborn.— Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) March 31, 2017David Urban is #maga Trump loyalist https://t.co/MqfrZZS9Zl— Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 31, 2017Big Government, David Urban, Donald Trump, katie walsh, Reince Priebus, Rick Dearborn, Sean Cairncross

by Kristina Wong31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHis two deputy national security advisers — K.T. McFarland (pictured above) and Dina Powell, and the person in charge of writing the national security strategy — Nadia Schadlow — are women.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt’s likely the first time that women have held those positions simultaneously — no insignificant fact in a field that’s still male-dominated.Together, McFarland, Powell and Schadlow bring different strengths to the table.McFarland is an experienced national security hand, starting at the NSC in 1970, as an 18-year-old college freshman.“At that time, there were maybe two women who were research assistants, but to be a professional expert on the national security council as a woman, in that era, at the very beginning of the baby boom, that just wasn’t going to be an option for women,” she said.“It wasn’t that we were discriminated against, it just wasn’t thought of.”It was a momentous time — Richard Nixon was president, Henry Kissinger was national security adviser. The issues were the Vietnam War, Paris Peace Accords, opening to China, arms control with the Soviet Union, Middle East shuttle diplomacy. McFarland started at the NSC as the nightshift secretary and left in 1976 as a research assistant.She later returned to government when Ronald Reagan became president, and was one of the highest ranking women at the Defense Department.Her experience served her well for her first challenge on the job: Building an NSC from scratch, particularly since her then-boss, Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, had never worked in the White House before.McFarland said she got the call from Trump on Thanksgiving night. Her first call was to her mentor, Kissinger. She then brought him and subsequent cabinet officials in to discuss their experiences.“Since President Trump did not come into office having a long experience in foreign policy and national security, had never been in government before, had never been in office before, I thought it made a lot of sense for us to start at the beginning and look … at former national security advisers,” she said.In the meantime, they were talking to Trump every day — he was already meeting and taking calls from foreign leaders.“It was a heady time, it was an exhausting time,” McFarland recalls.On January 20, she came into her new office. Her new desk was about 20 feet from where her first desk was, 47 years ago.She placed a call to Kissinger, so the dispatcher could say, “Henry Kissinger, the White House is calling.”“He was so moved and so touched,” she said.McFarland said the first thing Trump asked her to do is look at North Korea.She convened the deputies at the Departments of State, Defense, and Treasury, the Joint Chiefs, and from the intelligence community, and instructed them to come back in a few weeks with some ideas, and to “think outside the box.”“Don’t just think about a little bit of sanctions, a little bit of diplomacy. Open it wide, and think of any creative ideas you can and come back to us. And so they did. And what I was very impressed with was they had thought outside the box on a lot of things, and so we were able to craft some really good options for the president on how to deal with North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and that’s the process he’s in now,” she said.“We’ll do this for other issues as well — China, Russia, Venezuela, we’re going to look at the whole range of these issues for the president,” she added.McFarland calls terrorism “the challenge of our day.”She said while there were kamikaze attacks during World War II, today’s terrorists are targeting civilians, not military targets, and are “happy to die as long as they can bring others with them.”“If you look at the history of warfare, people always wanted to survive,” she said. “This is a threat we’ve never seen before.”Fellow Deputy National Security Adviser Powell brings to the table 10 years of working on Wall Street and a “get it done” mindset. She first came into the Trump administration as an assistant to the president and senior counselor for economic initiatives.But it also made sense for Powell, an Egyptian-American who was born in Cairo, migrated to Texas when she was four, and worked in the former George W. Bush administration and Congress on defense issues, to expand her role to the foreign policy realm.Powell, who wants to stay out of the spotlight, is working closely with McFarland and Schadlow to help build out the national security strategy. She particularly believes in the economic empowerment of women, particularly in the Middle East.Coming from one male-dominated career field to another, she believes that talent will carry one through — whether it’s from a male or female.Still, she recognizes that it can be hard for women to be confident in areas where there might not be a lot of other women, and that sometimes there have to be role models to pave the way.Hers were former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX).Schadlow, in addition to experience in government as a presidential management fellow, brings to the table experience in thinking deeply about long-term national security planning.Her first assignment in government was at the Department of the Army, where she was first exposed to the military.She later became the Pentagon’s first desk officer for Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union, a job that is the equivalent of country director today.Wanting more career mobility, she left the government for the Smith-Richardson Foundation, where she researched emerging national security threats — which she said was great preparation for her current role.Her role models include Marin Strmecki, senior vice president at the Smith-Richardson Foundation, but also her mother, who migrated from Italy to give her three daughters more opportunity, and encouraged them to be independent.Supporting McFarland, Powell and Schadlow is another echelon of accomplished women, such as Victoria Coates, senior director for strategic assessments at the NSC.Coates (pictured right) is a protégé of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Gov. Rick Perry (R-TX) and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. She last served as Cruz’s senior national security adviser.She has a Ph.D. in art history, and recently published a book on the history of democracy.Her role models were her mother, who is a chief compliance officer at a large firm, and Rumsfeld. She also credits McFarland with being a great friend and mentor.A typical day for them involves lots and lots of meetings.McFarland said a typical day involves getting up at 5 a.m., getting into office by 7 a.m. and receiving an intelligence briefing of major developments. Some days, she has an additional briefing on specific topics.Around 10 a.m., she usually goes in to see the president with her now-boss Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the CIA Director and other national security officials for the president’s daily briefing.“Then the rest of the day, I’m chairing meetings, I’m meeting with people on the NSC staff in the intelligence community, members of the White House staff, and then my day usually goes until seven or eight or nine o’clock at night,” she said.On one recent day, there were meetings ranging from Montenegro, Kurdish independence, to North Korea.The job is not particularly family friendly. The main obstacle? Classification issues.Much of the work can only be done in a secure environment inside the White House. That means mom has to live and work in Washington, D.C.McFarland’s five children are grown, but Powell, Schadlow and Coates all have young children who live at home outside of D.C.“You’re still not ever going to have it all — it’s impossible,” said Schadlow, who has three children.“I wished many times that I was a little more engaged with what my kids were learning in school, and I had the time to do a deep dive and just be part of that intellectual life that they’re experiencing, and in some ways I can’t do it day-to-day, especially now,” she said.She said while there are more services for working mothers these days, it’s still a challenge.“Of course there are tradeoffs. My house is always a wreck,” she laughs. “It’s real. It’s a constant balance.”Coates, who has a 15-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son, says it makes the time spent together more special.“I went to spring training with my son. We had 36 hours together… but they were 36 really good hours,” she said.Schadlow said as difficult as it is to be away from family, it can also be a luxury just to focus on work.“When you’re at home as a working mom, you’re constantly multitasking all day long, managing everyone’s schedules. A lot defaults to the mom, I think, still,” she said. “And here — no cell phones in your office, no way to communicate really day-to-day in the office. It’s really all about your work.”“I’m so happy to have the opportunity. It’s a luxury to jump in and focus on one thing for awhile, and knowing that everyone at home has sort of agreed to just take care the day-to-day,” she said.At the NSC, the women say they’ve found no difference in treatment due to their gender.McFarland calls Trump an “equal opportunity guy.”“President Trump is an equal opportunity guy in the sense of, I’m in a room, and as I said, I’m in the president’s daily briefing in the morning, and sometimes there’s only one woman in the room, and sometimes the vice president’s national security adviser — also a woman, Col. Andrea Thompson, is there, and the president will look at us and expect us to answer the tough questions just as readily as anybody else,” she said.“In fact sometimes when the really tough questions come, I look around at my male colleagues who are afraid to say something, and I’m the first one to jump in and say, ‘Well you could think of it this way, Mr. President.’ And often the only other person who jumps right in with me is the other woman,” she said.Her advice to women in any career field?“Don’t settle. Don’t settle for second best. And don’t quit, and don’t give up.”Big Government, National Security, Dina Powell, Donald Trump, K.T.

by Jeff Poor31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThursday on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show,” host Rachel Maddow said there was still a “possibility” President Donald Trump and his campaign were innocent of accusations of being in cahoots with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign and that this may not take down the Trump presidency.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIf that is indeed the case, Maddow urged her viewers not to let their guards down against public corruption, especially as there are any other numbers of storylines to pursue while the Trump-Russia saga dominates the news coverage.Partial transcript as follows:The news today that we may get testimony in exchange for immunity from fired National Security Advisor Mike Flynn who is in a position potentially to know more about the scandal than anybody else, that news today revs this scandal up into higher gear that we didn’t even know we had in our national transmission, and you know, we will — we here at the show and I think on this network, we will cover this as aggressively as anybody. I think it’s been fair to say we have been as aggressive as anybody on this story already and that will remain the case.But I want to just plant this flag here — there remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are innocent. There remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are not incident — not innocent, but that this scandal does not prove to be an existential presidency-ending conflagration, even if they are found to have committed very bad acts. There remains the possibility that at the end of this, even if these investigations continue to go as badly as they have for the president thus far, there remains the possibility that the end of all of it, he’s still president and then for the sake of our democracy, we have to figure out how we are going to regain our in tolerance for corruption and scandal and throwing our American ethical and political norms out the window.One of the consequences already of the Russia attack and it’s aftermath is that what otherwise would be presidency ending scandals in any presidential administration are like, whoo page 15, if you get there, man. I mean, when all this is over and who knows how it ends, if we are ever to regain our previous standing as a liberal democracy, right, there’s going to have to be consequences for, you know, the Carl Icahn stuff for the lying to the Senate stuff, for the personal ethics stuff, for the nepotism. Even for the political radicalism that we now see is definitely no big deal because at least it’s not treason.Whether or not the Russia scandal brings down this presidency and it might, the point of the Russia attack was to knock America down a few pegs in the eyes of the world. They win and we lose if the outcome of all of this — regardless of this presidency — is that we become a country that lets all this other stuff slide, right, we’re even rank corruption becomes normal or too small potatoes for us to worry about it. We cannot let ourselves be the American generation where the standard slipped that badly, right, where that happened. At some point, we’re going to have to get back to zero in terms of being able to be shocked by corruption, nepotism and crime in government. We’re going to have to get back to zero when it’s all done.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBreitbart TV, mike flynn, MSNBC, Rachel Maddow, The Rachel Maddow Show

If you post enough artsy, chic pictures of yourself that rack up plenty of ‘likes,’ then real life accomplishments will not matter because the popularity of your social media accounts will determine your status on the social hierarchy.”“This is especially true with Instagram, where ‘likes’ are the main way of interacting with pictures and videos that are posted by users,” they continued.In another question, 3,689 college students were asked: “Do you make an intentional effort to like people’s Instagram posts who like yours?”67 percent answered yes, while 33 percent said no.Additionally, when 9,477 college students were asked whether they know someone who deletes Instagram photos if they don’t get enough likes, 78 percent answered with a yes.“The large majority of Instagram users have formed unspoken alliances with each other to ensure they each tally enough ‘likes’ to make their posts stand out,” concluded LendEDU in their study. “It does not matter if Instagram users genuinely enjoy other Instagrammers posts; the only thing that matters is that each insincere expression of emotion from you will lead to your own Instagram page gaining more status.”Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

by Merrill Hope31 Mar 2017Trophy Club, TX0SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn March 21, Trophy Club police arrested Katherine Ruth Harper, a seventh grade English teacher at Tidwell Middle School in the Northwest Independent School District. She also coached cheerleaders. Officers alleged Harper, 27, had a sexual relationship with one of her students during the summer of 2016, a then 15-year-old male. They charged her with improper relationship between educator and student, a second degree felony, then booked her into the Denton County Jail. She bonded out after posting $15,000 bail.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis week, details about the illicit relationship emerged including how Harper and the teenager initially became involved over flirtatious text messages. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported the two had sex numerous times either at the teen’s Trophy Club home or at her Fort Worth residence from June 1, 2016 to July 31, 2016. They also exchanged naked selfies of each other by cell phone. The boy saved these images which police later retrieved when they seized his phone.Cell phone records showed the pair communicated roughly 76 times while involved intimately, according to the arrest warrant. The teenager eventually told a Child Protective Services investigator during one of their rendezvous, he and Harper drank alcohol and took off their clothes, the boy said he performed a sex act on his teacher. When a Tidwell school official questioned the teen, he cried and admitted to having the relationship.In September 2016, Northwest ISD learned about Harper’s salacious behavior but they could not investigate thoroughly because they had few details. The Star-Telegram indicated Harper was pregnant. The district got another tip in December saying a pregnant middle school teacher was involved with a student. From this, the Trophy Club Police Department initiated a three-month investigation that resulted in Harper’s March 21 arrest.Three days after Harper’s arrest, Grand Prairie police took into custody Rebecca Goerdel, a special education teacher at the all-boys Young Men’s Leadership Academy at the Kennedy Middle School. This follows accusations she had a sexual relationship with a juvenile, according to The Dallas Morning News.Grand Prairie ISD officials learned of the “potential impropriety” after school dismissal on March 10. They placed Goerdel, 28, on leave immediately. Local law enforcement launched a probe, leading to her arrest. On March 24, Grand Prairie ISD posted a statement on Facebook. Superintendent Susan Hull said “this kind of conduct is outrageous and will not be tolerated.” She added: “The teacher-student relationship is sacred. It reflects a vow from teachers to parents that their children are safe – as safe as they would be at home. When a teacher in Grand Prairie ISD breaks that vow, he or she will be dealt with quickly and aggressively. I encourage law enforcement to pursue all available action.”If women educators crossing the line with students sexually seems more prevalent, it is, says Dr. Ernest Zarra III, author of Teacher-Student Relationships: Crossing into the Emotional, Physical, and Sexual Realms. He told Breitbart Texas one reason for this is “there are many more women in education than men.”Also the author of the professional development tool, “Addressing Appropriate and Inappropriate Teacher-Student Relationships,” Zarra reflected on this national classroom crisis as a “a slow drip of a moral breakdown in the culture” where “sex surrounds all of us” abetted by technology, from the internet and online pornography to cell phone sexting. Access, too, becomes problematic, says Zarra because some teachers allow students to contact them at home or on vacation, blurring the walls of propriety. “What was a drip is now a tidal wave,” he added.State Senator Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston) called the troubling situation a “plague,” Breitbart Texas reported. His proposed Senate Bill 7 intends to crack down on an eight-year epidemic of Texas education professionals sexually preying on school children. In March, the Senate unanimously passed the bill. It moved onto the House Education Committee where it remains pending.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Education, Weird News, 2017 Texas legislative session, Dr. Ernest Zarra III, Educator-Student Sexual Misconduct, Grand Prairie ISD, Inappropriate Educator Relationships, Katherine Ruth Harper, Northwest ISD, Rebecca Goerdel, SB 7, Senator Paul Bettencourt, Teacher-Student Sexual Misconduct, Texas Education

by Tom Ciccotta31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERProfessor Lilienfeld argues in his study “Microaggressions: Strong Claims, Inadequate Evidence” that the recent spike in concern on college campuses over microaggressions may be based on a cultural phenomenon that carries little psychological evidence.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“The scientific status of the microaggression research program is far too preliminary to warrant its dissemination to real-world contexts,” Lilienfeld writes in his study.Lilienfeld’s greatest concern about microaggressions rests in the nature of how they are reported. He claims that because “they are totally in the eye of the beholder,” anything can be labeled a microaggression.“Because they are totally in the eye of the beholder — anything you say could be labeled as a microaggression,” Lilienfeld said. “In the current literature, if someone is offended by something, it is a microaggression. You simply cannot progress scientifically in this way or expect to resolve racial tensions on a college campus.”Talking to The College Fix, Lilienfeld argued that the term “microaggression” implies harm, which may lead to biases in judgments made about behaviors that receive this label.“Though the study of microaggressions has revealed important biases, the term is a terrible one because it implies that the intention of the person is aggressive in nature and aggression implies the intent to harm,” he claimed.Lilienfeld also argues that the actual effects of a microaggression may be blurred by an individual’s pre-existing personality or mental health condition.“We know that microaggressions are correlated with negative mental health outcomes, but that finding may be confounded with a person’s pre-existing personality or mental health condition. Because microaggressions are determined by self-report, it is difficult to prove that they cause mental health problems,” Lilienfeld said.At the conclusion of his study’s abstract, Lilienfeld argues that the term “microaggression” should be abandoned.“I conclude with 18 suggestions for advancing the scientific status of the MRP, recommend abandonment of the term ‘microaggression,’ and call for a moratorium on microaggression training programs and publicly distributed microaggression lists pending research to address the MRP’s scientific limitations,” he wrote.Lilienfeld believes that microaggression programming on college campuses will likely only serve to exacerbate existing racial tensions.“Concern about microaggressions may make both sides more defensive,” Lilienfeld said. “Minority individuals may become hyper vigilant to recognize any signs of danger from speech or action. Conversely, majority members may begin to feel defensive because they have to watch every single thing they say.”Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

You have even held the door open for me when we both walked out of the building together. I really appreciate the times you have helped me out when I needed it.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAlvarado’s column, “To the Racist Guy Who Picked Up my Pencil,” builds up to the thesis that polite acts do not excuse an individual’s underlying racism, which she claims could be seen in Facebook posts that her peer had made such as those that read “building the wall,” “#AllLivesMatter,” and “we cannot tell which refugees are terrorists.”“This open letter goes out to every racist person who has ever picked up my dropped pencil; said “bless you” after I sneezed; stopped to ask me how my Christmas break was, has written “happy birthday” on my Facebook wall, has said “good morning” to me as we walk past each other on campus, or has asked me where I got my “cute shirt” from,” she continues. “No smile, compliment, or favor will erase the fact that I know you do not actually want my family and me in this country.”Comments on the column were quick to point out that those that are against illegal immigration oppose the illegal entry of persons of all ethnic backgrounds.“Leftist (sic) often get criticized for an alleged “If you don’t agree with my views, you’re just a bigot” attitude, and this piece functions as an interesting case study in that mentality,” one commenter said.Another argued that if the author’s attitude was applied to other laws, it would seem absurd: “If I call for harsh penalties for tax fraud, it’s not personal. Learning that you cheat on your taxes doesn’t change my opinion about tax law — it changes my opinion about YOU.

by James Delingpole31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut the question was a purely rhetorical one. I already knew the depressing true answer having just sat, fuming, in my car listening to Mann being given the red carpet treatment on a BBC Radio 4 science programme.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Oh Professor Doctor Mann, Sir, may it please your eminence to descend from your radiant cloud for a few precious moments and explain to us mere mortals why your amazing and unquestionably brilliant new paper on global warming demonstrates you to be even more right about climate change than you were even in the days when you won your Nobel prize?” fawned and grovelled the BBC’s interviewer from his prostrate position on the studio floor.Perhaps I exaggerate slightly.But it would be fair to say that the BBC’s interviewer, Adam Rutherford, sought to leave the listener in no doubt that when it came to climate science the “Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science” Michael Mann was a respected expert of great insight whose opinions one could totally trust.Mann isn’t though, is he?Maybe in 2001, when Mann’s Hockey Stick was promoted heavily in the IPCC’s Third Assessment Report, it would have been legitimate enough for the BBC to quote him as a climate scientist of note.But that was 16 years ago, since when the Hockey Stock has been discredited to the point where not even the IPCC quotes it in its reports. And where Mann’s reputation has become so tarnished that Mark Steyn was able to compile and edit a 300-page book called A Disgrace To The Profession, consisting largely of distinguished scientists from around the world explaining in lavish detail how utterly flawed, bankrupt and worthless Michael Mann’s climate science was.“Misleading”; “Just bad science”; “Very erroneous conclusions”; “A crock of shit”; “Excuse me while I puke.”….just a few of things scientists had to say about Mann and his work.But as we were reminded yet again on the BBC’s Inside Science programme this week, the BBC continues to treat this tainted and controversial figure with uncritical reverence.On the programme, his interviewer Adam Rutherford allowed Mann space to give a version of this week’s Congressional hearing on climate science so ludicrously biased towards the alarmist narrative it might have been scripted by Greenpeace.“We have currently as the chair of the House of Representatives Science Committee an individual – Lamar Smith – whose funding mostly comes from fossil fuel interests who rejects the overwhelming consensus of the world’s scientists that climate change is real and human caused and represents a threat. The hearing was intended to provide cover to Congressional Republicans and the current Trump administration who are trying to cut funding for climate science and who are trying to roll back the policy successes over the last several years in dealing with climate change and dealing with carbon emissions.”“As the hearing went on every time the topic was about the substance, what the science has to say, my feeling was that the Congressional Republicans realised that they were on the defensive, that they were losing the argument because, after all, they are denying the overwhelming consensus of the world’s scientists. And eventually it got into the gutter where they were trying to discredit me personally and to talk about squabbles between scientists in a sense it was a confirmation that they knew they had lost the actual scientific argument at that hearing.”“It’s a difficult period right now for anybody who cares about science. We’re about to see an unprecedented event next month here in DC where scientists are going to be marching in the streets….I think it’s a recognition from the typically quite reticent and conservative scientific community that they have to speak out now, that there’s a threat to science and to scientists unlike anything that we have, in my view, faced in the past.”None of this weapons grade bilge went even slightly challenged by Rutherford, who flagged his own concerns about the Trump administration’s approach to climate science at the beginning of the interview by describing it as “troubling” and “disturbing”. [Says who? Why??]Let’s not forget, also, that there were three other scientists with at least as much knowledge and experience as Mann who were speaking at the same Congressional hearings, only from a sceptical point of view. Might it not have been useful for the purposes of balance to get at least one of them – John Christy, Judith Curry or Roger Pielke Jr – for the BBC to hear from one of them too?In theory, this is one of the BBC’s statutory obligations.According to the terms of its revised Charter 2006:‘The BBC must do all it can to ensure that controversial subjects are treated with due accuracy and impartiality in all relevant output.’As Christopher Booker detailed in his thorough report for the Global Warming Policy Foundation The BBC And Climate Change: A Triple Betrayal – the BBC has consistently failed to do this in its woefully one-sided treatment of environmental issues.Indeed, the BBC hasn’t just failed to remain impartial on the issue; it has actively proselytised on behalf of the climate change scare lobby across a range of programmes from the hysterical reportage of its green-activist-in-chief Roger Harrabin on BBC Radio 4 news, to the doddery laments of its house Malthusian Sir David Attenborough, to the mad-eyed eco-lunacy of Chris Packham, to the rampant global warming alarmism promoted by its entire celebrity science team from Adam Rutherford (see above) to perma-smiley pouty boy physicist Brian Cox and its stupendously-pleased-with-themselves lefty comics Robin Ince and Daragh O’Briaiaiaan.All this would be absolutely totally fine if the BBC were a private subscription channel whose sole purpose was to reinforce the ill-informed prejudices of the liberal elite.But it’s not. It’s supposed to be for everyone. Even deplorables like you and me.In this regard it fails. And always will fail. Scrap the licence fee, I say.

by Jack Montgomery31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWriting in the New Statesman, the 63-year-old claimed that pursuing a Brexit deal which takes Britain out of the Single Market in order to control immigration “reflects the views of vocal and influential hardliners, not the majority of the public”.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHe called for “a national, pro-European effort … to unite opinion in civic society and mainstream politics,” based on the aforementioned “three Rs”.“We have vocally to oppose what we don’t agree with … That is why pro-refugee, anti-Trump demos, the Gina Miller case, new newspapers or campaigns against hard Brexit are so important,” he said.Mandelson believes that on issues such as “globalisation, identity [and] migration” establishment “Tory, Labour, Lib Dem, SNP and Green MPs and activists” share a great deal of common ground, and that “new networks” would have to be created to help them co-ordinate.Finally, he urged the recruitment of “a new generation of leaders” from the world beyond traditional politics.

For over 30 years, she lived in the Stockholm suburb of Tensta but says that she no longer feels safe there. She claims Muslim fundamentalists have taken over and she doesn’t feel she can visit the centre of Tensta without being harassed, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAccording to Ms. Pekgul, the situation for women in public life in the area has deteriorated over the past several years. She noted that there has been a rise in religious fundamentalism amongst the men in the area, many of whom come from migrant backgrounds. Pekgul attempted to combat the trend by organising coffee shop meetings but soon abandoned the idea.“In Tensta I am a known face and I have no desire to stir up trouble when I get harassed,” Pekgul said explaining why she no longer goes into the centre of the suburb. When asked if she will remain in the suburb, she said: “I always hope that it will blow over. One should never forget that the vast majority here are cursing the fundamentalists.”Zeliha Dagli, a former Left Party politician, did end up moving from the no-go suburb of Husby. Dagli described Husby as having self-appointed “morality police” who attempt to control women’s behaviour in the area.Aggression toward feminists, in particular, became an issue she said. “There were rumours that we wanted to take away women’s veils,” she said. “They said that I should keep myself, and then I did not feel so safe anymore.”Dagli now lives in the inner city area of Stockholm and says she is happier that she can wear or say what she wants without fearing for her safety. She said she would consider returning to Husby, but only if the area became safer for her.Husby, like the no-go suburb of Rinkeby, is heavily populated by migrants, many of them from countries in Africa and the Middle East and many of them Muslim.  In May of last year, a Norwegian film crew was attacked by a group of locals in Husby while they were attempting to interview Swedish economist and author Tino Sanandaji.Sanandaji, a Kurdish Iranian immigrant, has been slammed by many in Sweden for his new book Mass Challenge which describes the problems Sweden has faced because of mass migration.

by Frances Martel31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLatin American media have labeled the move an autogolpe (“self-coup”), recalling the dissolution of Congress by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in 1992. With the notable exception of Russia, the international community has demanded President Nicolás Maduro and the Supreme Court undo the unconstitutional power grab and return lawmaking authority to the popularly-elected legislature.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLate Wednesday night, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling stating that the National Assembly was in “contempt” of the socialist government. “While the contempt scenario persists and the National Assembly remains invalid, this institution will guarantee that the parliamentary duties be executed directly by this institution or whatever institution it wishes,” the statement read.The Supreme Court had previously ruled that the National Assembly did not have lawmaking powers, claiming that three anti-socialist legislators elected in December 2015 – the election that turned the Venezuelan Socialist Party (PSUV) into the minority in the legislature for the first time in the Chávez era – had committed fraud. “Legally, the National Assembly does not exist,” then-vice-president Aristobulo Isturiz said last year. The Assembly persisted, however, continued to be internationally recognized as the lawmaking body of Venezuela.Maduro himself had also tried to usurp the Assembly’s power by creating a “Communal Parliament,” but this move was rapidly dismissed as unconstitutional and, by the lawmakers it attempted to silence, as “nonsense.”Previous attempts to silence the legislature did not account for the power vacuum that dissolving the lawmaking body would leave. Now, however, the Supreme Court has granted itself all legislative powers, solving that issue for Maduro.While consistently dismissing the legislature as invalid, Maduro himself has disregarded his own unconstitutional presence in the presidential palace. The legislature organized a recall vote against Maduro, as permitted by the Venezuelan constitution, and submitted a legal recall petition to the government in late 2016. Maduro’s electoral commission rejected the recall bid unconstitutionally, eliminating Maduro’s authority as president.On Thursday, the leadership of the anti-Maduro opposition in the Assembly responded to the decree. National Assembly President Julio Borges tore the Supreme Court ruling up and tossed it on the floor of the steps of the assembly.“This ruling is garbage,” he told reporters. “We do not recognize it. It is a coup d’etat.”“This ruling gives Maduro all the power to make whatever laws he wants, sign whatever contracts he wants, indebt the country however he wants, and persecute Venezuelans however he wants. It is a coup d’etat in its pure form, it is a dctatorship and the world needs to help Venezuela in its decision to change this dictatorship with a vote,” Borges added.Much of the world has responded. “The United States condemns the Venezuelan Supreme Court’s March 29 decision to usurp the power of the democratically elected National Assembly,” State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement Thursday. “We call for the government of Venezuela to permit the democratically-elected National Assembly to perform its constitutional functions, hold elections as soon as possible and to release all political prisoners.”“The continued restrictions on freedom of movement, association, expression, and peaceful protest are not only profoundly concerning, but counterproductive in an extremely polarized country that suffers an economic and social crisis,” UN human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said in a statement. “I firmly encourage the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision.”“Unfortunately, what we had warned has now come to pass,” Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General Luis Almagro said in response to the ruling. “The Secretary General of the OAS denounces the self-inflicted coup d’état perpetrated by the Venezuelan regime against the National Assembly, the last branch of government to be legitimized by the will of the people of Venezuela,” the organization said in a statement.Even the Liberal Party government of Canada – run by a family friend of longtime Venezuelan allies, the Castro family – condemned the move. “Canada is deeply concerned by Venezuela Supreme Court’s decision to suspend legislative powers of democratically elected National Assembly,” the government said on Twitter.With the exception of longtime Maduro allies – the propaganda outlet Telesur, the government of Cuba – only one major international player abstained from criticizing the Venezuelan Supreme Court: Russia. “External forces should not add fuel to the fire to the conflict inside Venezuela,” the Russian government asserted in a statement Friday. “We are confident in the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.” National Security, Argetina, Latin America, Mercosur, Nicolas Maduro, socialism, Venezuela

The Aegis website refers all media inquiries to GardaWorld, whose executives didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment,” notes WSJ. “GardaWorld is one of the biggest security companies in Afghanistan and is based in Canada, according to its website.”The DEA has acknowledged that the vast majority of heroin in Canada originates in Afghanistan.Since the war against terrorism began in Afghanistan more than 15 years ago in October 2015, the U.S. government has spent $8.5 billion in American taxpayer funds on counternarcotics effort.“Nonetheless, Afghanistan remains the world’s leading producer of opium, providing 80% of the global output over the past decade, according to the United Nations,” reports the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency.Moreover, estimated opium production in Afghanistan skyrocketed to 4,800 tons in 2015, 25 times more than when the United States invaded the country in 2001.SIGAR reported in December 2014 that some U.S. taxpayer-funded reconstruction efforts, “such as improved irrigation, roads, and agricultural assistance,” were being used to cultivate opium in Afghanistan.Unfortunately, the recent incident is not the first time that American personnel in Afghanistan has been caught using illegal drugs.Two U.S. air-traffic controllers were found dead last year from what appeared to be heroin overdoses.Furthermore, some U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan have been investigated “on suspicion of using or distributing heroin, morphine or other opiates during 2010 and 2011,” the Associated Press (AP) reported in 2012.Breitbart News has analyzed Pentagon data that shows the number of U.S. service members testing positive for heroin has increased throughout the course of the war in Afghanistan.Some analysts, such as scientist and author William Edstrom, deny the DEA claims that only about one percent of the heroin in the United States, where it is fueling one of the worst deadly drug epidemics in history, comes from the Afghanistan-Pakistan area.Referring to the DEA claim that most of the heroin in the U.S. comes from Latin America, an article on the heroin surge noted in September 2015:Perhaps heroin shipments from Afghanistan are at lower risk of being seized than heroin coming from Latin America. Might some be entering through government channels, when so much materiel and so many personnel (soldiers, aid workers, diplomats, and contractors) fly directly between the US and Afghanistan?Putting aside the issue of the provenance of the US heroin supply for the moment, surely we can look at heroin as we would any other global commodity.Citing a September 2015 report from the WSJ, the article points out that U.S. “friendly fire” in top opium-producing southern Afghanistan “hit a 30 member elite counternarcotics police unit as they were on a mission.”Big Journalism, Marijuana, National Security, Kabul, Opium, State Department, U.S. embassy








by Breitbart London31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROrban has long accused Hungarian-born Soros of meddling in central and eastern Europe and of seeking to undermine the continent by backing mass immigration.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Cheating is cheating… It doesn’t matter if you are a billionaire, you are not above the law,” Orban said during an interview on public radio.The Central European University (CEU), set up in 1991 after the end of communism and part-funded by Soros, said in a statement that it “utterly rejects” Orban’s allegations.“We have been lawful partners in Hungarian higher education for 25 years and any statement to the contrary is false,” the university said.Orban, 53, personally received a Soros grant in the 1980s to study abroad.– US ‘concern’ –The far-right premier has been a leading opponent in the EU of immigration, calling it a threat to Europe’s Christian identity.His anti-Soros quest intensified on Tuesday with the publication of proposed legislation that would tighten rules for foreign-based universities operating in Hungary.The CEU believes it is the main target of Orban’s plan — something the government denies — and has said that its existence is under threat.Orban said Friday that the aim was to stop universities from countries outside of the European Union from being able to cheat students.He said it followed checks on 28 foreign institutions that uncovered irregularities.“Several foreign universities are breaking the rules, including the Soros university,” he said.Orban argues that the US-registered CEU enjoys an unfair advantage over local universities because it can award both a Hungarian diploma and an American one.The proposed new rules would ban the awarding of Hungarian diplomas without an international agreement between national governments.Institutions must also have operations in their home country.The future of the CEU, which does not have a US campus, now “depends on talks between the governments of Hungary and the United States,” Orban said.A statement from the US State Department Friday expressed “concern” about the legislation which reportedly could go before parliament early next week.“We urge the government of Hungary to avoid taking any legislative action that would compromise CEU’s operations or independence,” it said.Currently teaching 1,400 students from more than 100 countries, the English-language institution ranks among the top 50 universities in the world in political science and international studies.In an interview with AFP on Thursday, the CEU’s president and rector Michael Ignatieff called the proposed new rules “unacceptable, targeted at CEU, and an attack on academic freedom”.“We will be open for business and accept students and teach them next year, if I have to teach in a tent in a park in Budapest I will do so,” said the former Canadian politician, insisting that the university “will not be bullied”.Breitbart London, George Soros, hungary, Viktor Orbán








by Linda Tripp31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis is not whistleblowing by any stretch. It is sabotage. And it is highly coordinated and includes Hillary Clinton, whose sights are firmly set on 2020. Let us recall she wanted nothing more than to run against Donald Trump. A political neophyte who had never held elected office and a reality TV star to boot, he was her dream opponent. An “easy-peasy” win, a favored term of Hillary’s. In fact, leaked emails reported by Breitbart show the Hillary Campaign coordinating with the DNC to elevate this “pied piper” candidate rationalizing he would be the least palatable to the electorate. This walk-in-the-park scenario was her guaranteed ticket to the White House. Finally. In the annals of American history, it will go down as the greatest of grand underestimations.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHillary will use whatever means necessary to achieve her goal. To that end, and in an unprecedented fashion, she and her cohorts work tirelessly behind the scenes in a highly coordinated effort to delegitimize this president. And it began bright and early in the morning hours of November 9th.She is not working alone. With the help of thousands of imbedded Obama supporters who occupy federal civil service positions and dogged obstructionists in Congress, a clear pattern emerges. As always, they have the eager help of the mainstream media.Hillary may have licked her wounds for a short time following her historic defeat, but she has not been idle. Now she is “coming out of the woods”, a veiled reference to her post defeat meeting with a young woman in the woods near her home. It soon became clear it was all contrived, a great photo op to remind us of all things Hillary. An upbeat photo op of a real trooper designed to belie the orchestrated backroom activities.In an attempt to remain relevant, she schedules speeches across the land. The “Queen of Resist and Persist” is readying herself for 2020. That the democrats might not be inclined to back her is of little concern to her and rightfully so. After all, they installed Nancy Pelosi once again, despite the shellacking her leadership earned. Democrats have not learned a thing from the voters. From Hillary’s age old perspective, the voters exist to be manipulated and she is confident that this time it will work. She has a plan.As Hillary eyes 2020, she does so with confidence. Again she is underestimating President Trump, and as always, she underestimates American voters. Seen as little more than a fluke, she believes the machinations afoot to undermine him will result in a failed presidency if not impeachment, ensuring smooth sailing to a victory that was always her for the taking.Many believe she has the help of former President Obama, who himself campaigned vigorously for her, claiming candidate Trump was dangerous and unfit, even staking his own presidential legacy and reputation on her victory The writing was on the wall, and as we learn more about his interest in undermining Trump, it will likely become clear how determined this man actually was.There is so much that is positively historic about this election and its aftermath. It appears that massive and unprecedented leaks are occurring on a virtually daily basis. Now we are to believe “they” happened to tap the President-Elect and members of his transition team in an “oops” moment, but at the same time found a new way to have that surveillance information disseminated throughout the intelligence community. That had never happened before. After eight years in office but just days before his exit, President Obama took the unusual step of ensuring this was not only possible, but legal. The man had a plan.There is no “incidentally” in high powered surveillance. There is no “incidental” at the presidential level. Period. And at no time would individuals be unmasked. I believe the “incidental” was the target, and “incidental” was the cover. This had to be approved at the very highest levels of government.Then there are the unprecedented massive illegal leaks which on a daily basis allow the mainstream media to spin their wheels about every manner of alleged malfeasance with nothing but anonymous leaks and sources to back their stories. It is all of a piece, all designed to delegitimize, in fact paralyze this presidency. There will never be a paper trail. It will be virtually impossible to prove. The media by and large are imbedded participants in this nefarious operation. But it is an organized attack and it is headed by the highest of the high. How do I know this?In 1998 when Hillary was documented to have said “Get me anything and everything on Linda Tripp”, she meant it. Two political hacks at the Pentagon were more than happy, in fact eager, to oblige. They broke the law, releasing Privacy Act protected information, and in doing so, cemented public perception of my new villain status. I knew both these lackeys well. They were foot soldiers for the White House. They would never have broken the law without a direct order from the White House. That none of it was true was irrelevant. That I had been completely truthful mattered not at all. That I had never broken the law in my life mattered not at all. Blatantly illegal, but it got the job done. The villain in the sordid presidential saga was not Bill Clinton. It was Linda Tripp.I sued and won. But it was a hollow victory. There was no getting my good name back. And there was no personal punishment for those who broke the law. I was awarded half a million dollars from the government in a lawsuit that went on for years, ultimately proving the orchestrated malfeasance on the part of those in power.But this settlement was a small price to pay to completely change the dialogue. It created a new villain out of whole cloth and ensured then President Clinton was seen as the merely adulterous and hapless victim of evil perpetrators, not the cruel serial abuser of women or the menacing and quite powerful obstructer of justice he most certainly was. Their reach was significant, even ensuring my case was reassigned from a sympathetic judge to a Clinton appointed judge. In the hands of yet another FOB, it ensured my anticipated win would not amount to much. Job well done.It is all happening again today, but on an astronomically more elevated scale. Now many imbedded Obama people all across the government, but most specifically in the Intelligence Community, are doing everything in their power to undermine President Trump. Their goal is to incapacitate him. Unprecedented leaks, fake news and accusations litter the airwaves, the mainstream media just as complicit now as they were proven to be during the campaign.Once again it changes the dialogue and puts the focus precisely where Hillary wants it to be. She can only do this with the committed assistance of the press. As in 1998, members of the press don’t see their job as reporting the news, but unabashedly making the news. Fake or otherwise, it matters not at all. With such a concerted effort , this administration will spend a great deal of time batting down the ridiculous attacks leaving them with significantly less time to focus on the people’s agenda. And that is precisely the point.There will be investigation upon investigation. Political hacks will lie, others will swear to it. Nothing will ever be definitively proven, but the damage will be done. It is the old “where there is smoke, there is fire” routine, the piling on ensuring that at best this administration is seen as questionable, at worst as lawbreakers worthy of removal. Our lady in waiting, Hillary Clinton, pictures herself poised to rescue the country from this dangerous man.Nineteen years ago, I had no voice. Objecting to their powerful portrayal of me as a villain was hopelessly futile, akin to protesting in an enormous vacuum. Effectively silenced by those in power, I soon understood the impossibility for a private citizen to be heard above as powerful an entity as the White House. The mighty voices of the Clintons and the mainstream media were deafening, a runaway train plowing down anyone in its way. It resonated all across the land.It does not have to be that way this time.If he continues to take his case directly to the American people, President Trump can defeat the powerful conjoined forces that would destroy his presidency. And make no mistake, this is their goal.The illegal leakers must be rooted out and fired. In government, everyone spies on everyone else, so this can be done. These people have committed felonies and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Those who incidentally spied on the Trump transition should be held to account. And as to the Fourth Estate, many more outlets exist than giants such as NBC, CNN, ABC, CBS or the Washington Post and the New York Times. He owes these outlets nothing but the routine White House access to which they are entitled.Continued outreach to alternative and local news outlets and regular forays into the country to address large groups of Americans will allow his agenda to “trump” the media who seek to destroy him. He can quite literally eradicate the nasty filter of those who have proven their allegiance not to the truth, but to a partisan agenda. It will render them irrelevant.Many members of the media obsess on “the Russians” to the exclusion of virtually anything else. They want, in fact need, a Russia-Trump connection and if there is not one, they will invent one. Recall if you can what level of coverage existed about the questionable deal that sold about 20% of our Uranium to Russia while she was Secretary of State. Or those same uranium investors who then funneled $145,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Or about the $500,000 speech Bill Clinton gave in Moscow. Recall how much interest was shown when it was learned that members of her presidential campaign met “with the Russians”. None of this speaks to the media point of view so it is swept under the rug. If they don’t report it, it didn’t happen. But this is only one prong of the full frontal attack.The imbedded Obama careerists are sabotaging their own President for political gain. The incidental spying is strongly related as well. The behind the scenes machinations coordinated by Hillary play a large part in achieving her ultimate goal. Her rise, his fall.Taken together, it is frighteningly reminiscent of the Soviet Union. The nefarious and widely orchestrated campaign against the President by members of his own government is straight out of a Soviet spy novel. As is the KGB-like surveillance of a political opponent, incidental or otherwise in our country. And history reminds us of the Mother of all Fake news, their massive propaganda machine. It ensured news was what they chose it to be, literally defining Soviet Russia for so many years. We are perilously close to that today. In America. President Trump has a voice. He must never stop using it.Linda Tripp worked in both the Bill Clinton administration and the George H.W. Bush White House. Under Bush, she served as executive assistant to the deputy chief of staff to the president. During the Clinton administration, she first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside the Oval Office. After three months, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster asked Tripp to work for the White House Counsel’s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons in their infamous scandals.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, 2020 Presidential Race, anti-Trump media, Hillary Clinton, Linda Trip, Nancy Pelosi, president clinton, U.S. President Donald J Trump, White House








Hillary Clinton and 6 aides had access to classified State Department information after she left office, lawmaker says | @edhenry pic.twitter.com/hJzHUaD7zCby Jeff Poor31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFriday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” network correspondent Ed Henry reported Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) had revealed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential nominee for the Democratic Party, and six of her aides retained their access to top secret and classified information after leaving the State Department in 2013.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“We’re learning from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that she and six staffers in 2013 retained clearances where they still had access to top secret and classified information,” Henry said. “Why? They were titled ‘research assistants.’ So the assumption on Capitol Hill is it was because she was writing her memoirs and saying, ‘Look, I still need access to this information in order to go through what happened in Syria, what happened with Russia. But obviously think back to what James Comey said in how Hillary Clinton handled classified information.”Henry was referring to Comey’s July 2016 statement calling Clinton “extremely careless” in how she handled classified information.“He obviously believes something needs to be done about this,” Henry added. “The only positive for Chuck Grassley at this point is, there’s no longer a Democrat at the State Department, obviously. You got Rex Tillerson, so if you have these documents on why she retained these clearances, and for example does she still have a clearance today? A lot of former officials get to keep these clearances for years — when they’re consultants … some of them like to retain it because they say I was in the middle of all of these important issues. I need to keep abreast of it.

by Joel B. Pollak31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Sacramento Bee‘s Christopher Cadelago reports: “”Rather than starting a committee for lieutenant governor, like many others who need a place to hold campaign funds, the rising Democrat has chosen the only other statewide office she would conceivably consider in the future: California governor.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn 2026, presuming she seeks and wins re-election to the U.S. Senate, Harris would be in the middle of her second six-year term, an ideal moment to seek the state’s chief executive office. That, in turn, could be a springboard to the presidential race in 2028 or 2032 — a step many observers expect Harris to take, eventually.Thus far, Harris’s record in the Senate has been a rather conventional liberal one. She was one of the first Democrats to declare that she would oppose the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, providing an oddly appropriate justification: “Judge Gorsuch has consistently valued narrow legalisms over real lives. I cannot support his nomination.”Judge Gorsuch has consistently valued narrow legalisms over real lives. I cannot support his nomination.https://t.co/ocDD7DvKnd— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) March 24, 2017It is not clear what Harris meant by “real lives,” but the idea that any judge would reject “narrow legalism” — i.e. the law — in favor of deciding cases on the basis of social or other considerations is antithetical to the Western, Judeo-Christian tradition tradition of justice — and fundamental to the radical ideology of today’s Democratic Party.In addition to banking money for the 2026 governor’s race, Harris is currently raising money off a campaign against Breitbart News — a successful startup in her home state. In an e-mail to supporters this week, she recycled a series of false charges (emphasis added):Since joining the Trump campaign last year, Steve Bannon has used his influence at the right-wing “news” site Breitbart as a propaganda tool [sic]. The website has attacked American heroes like Gabby Giffords [sic], spread racist and anti-Semitic hate [sic], and promoted fake news in the pursuit of advancing Trump’s radical agenda [sic].And a few moments ago they — and other conservative sites — started targeting Kamala [sic] for leading the charge to prevent the Republicans from defunding and defaming Planned Parenthood.Not a single claim in the above paragraphs is true, but evidently raising campaign cash is a more urgent priority than truth.Donations go to Harris’s 2022 Senate re-election campaign, not her 2026 governor’s race.Joel B.

by Nate Church31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe International Classification of Diseases, published by the World Health Organization, would define “Gaming Disorder” as a “persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour (i.e., ‘digital gaming’ or ‘video-gaming’) characterised by an impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities and continuation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.” In other words, a lack of self-control regarding video games is being legitimized as a specific mental illness.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis isn’t anything new. According to comment provided to Breitbart Tech by Dr. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Department of Psychology at Stetson University, “scholars have been investigating the concept of ‘video game addiction’ for probably over 2 decades now.” Despite all efforts, Dr. Ferguson points out that we still lack “any real clarity” about “how to define the concept, assess it, or whether it even is a ‘real’ thing in the sense of it being unique to video games.”But that hasn’t stopped anyone from trying. According to Dr. Ferguson:Despite [the lack of clarity] we’ve seen some pushes to institutionalize video game addiction as “internet gaming disorder” in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (published by the American Psychiatric Association) and, now as “gaming disorder” in the International [Classification] of Diseases (published by the World Health Organization.)The concerns among some scholars are manifest.  It’s not clear why video games are being singled out as compared to many other behaviors that can become addictive (sex, food, work, exercise, etc.)That’s why Ferguson and a number of his colleagues have published an open letter to the WHO regarding this classification:Concerns about problematic gaming behaviors deserve our full attention. However, we claim that it is far from clear that these problems can or should be attributed to a new disorder. The empirical basis for a Gaming Disorder proposal, such as in the new ICD-11, suffers from fundamental issues. Our main concerns are the low quality of the research base, the fact that the current operationalization leans too heavily on substance use and gambling criteria, and the lack of consensus on symptomatology and assessment of problematic gaming.And this isn’t a simple matter of semantics. The ramifications of haphazardly diagnosing people with a mental illness are enormous:The act of formalizing this disorder, even as a proposal, has negative medical, scientific, public-health, societal, and human rights fallout that should be considered. Of particular concern are moral panics around the harm of video gaming. They might result in premature application of diagnosis in the medical community and the treatment of abundant false-positive cases, especially for children and adolescents. Second, research will be locked into a confirmatory approach, rather than an exploration of the boundaries of normal versus pathological. Third, the healthy majority of gamers will be affected negatively.In addition to public panic, premature diagnoses, and the tendency to approach further study with the assumption that the disorder is real — the bias of the aforementioned “confirmatory approach” — there are even more serious issues at hand. First, that “the premature inclusion of Gaming Disorder as a diagnosis in ICD-11 will cause significant stigma to the millions of children who play video games as a part of a normal, healthy life.”The most serious implications of this study, Dr. Ferguson points out, are that the classification could very easily “end up as an excuse to put some kids in harsh ‘treatment’ camps or perhaps be used as an excuse for media regulation/censorship,” especially in “non-Democratic countries.”That conclusion might be seen as mere conjecture if not for correspondence between Dr. Ferguson and Drs. Geoffrey Reed and Vladimir Poznyak, both involved in the drafting of ICD-11, specifically noting “enormous pressure, especially from Asian countries” and “strong request from [WHO] stakeholders” to include this definition of Gaming Disorder.Drs. Reed and Poznyak did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Breitbart Tech.The classification could have negative effects across the world, especially where labels of mental illness could rob someone of their rights. Imagine if having Angry Birds installed on your smartphone was enough of an excuse to mandate attendance at a “treatment camp,” and you’re starting to get an idea of how this could go very wrong, very quickly.But even aside from all of that, Dr. Ferguson argues the science just doesn’t back up the WHO’s conclusion:Many of the “symptoms” proposed (particularly for the DSM version) are kind of normal stuff that many studies suggest aren’t really good predictors of problems. There’s also data suggesting the whole concept of “video game addiction” isn’t really stable and tends to go away by itself over time without treatment.The concern lies in the history of using classifications of mental illness as a weapon against groups and individuals by countries’ governments. Over 6,000 people in China — most of them teenagers — have been treated with actual electroshock therapy just because they were thought to have used the Internet too much. China also has a long history of committing whistleblowers and other dissidents to psychiatric “care” for the crime of disagreement. The subject is extensively covered in the 2002 book Dangerous Minds: Political Psychiatry in China Today and Its Origins in the Mao Era, published by Human Rights Watch.Richard J. Bonnie’s paper “Political Abuse of Psychiatry in the Soviet Union and in China: Complexities and Controversies,” published in The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law in 2002, also paints a picture of just how convenient it can be for the powerful to leverage psychological diagnoses in order to silence those who disagree. He explains that such practices are “uniformly understood to be a particularly pernicious form of repression,” citing examples in which “psychatric diagnosis was essentially an exercise of social power.” By way of example, Bonnie explains:Under applicable laws of Russia and the other former Soviet Republics, a person charged with a crime could be subjected to “custodial measures of a medical nature” if the criminal act was proved and the person was found “nonimputable” due to mental illness.7 Nonimputable offenders could be placed in maximum security hospitals (the notorious “special hospitals”) or in ordinary hospitals, depending on their social dangerousness. All the persons interviewed by the delegation had been found nonimputable and socially dangerous and confined in special hospitals after criminal proceedings that deviated substantially from the general requirements specified in Soviet law. Typically, the patients reported that they had been arrested, taken to jail, taken to a hospital for forensic examination, and then taken to another hospital under a compulsory treatment order, without ever seeing an attorney or appearing in
court.The delegation found that there was no clinical basis for the judicial finding of nonimputability in 17 of these cases. In fact, the delegation found no evidence of mental disorder of any kind in 14 cases. It is likely that these individuals are representative of many hundreds of others who were found nonimputable for crimes of political or religious dissent in
the Soviet Union, mainly between 1970 and 1990.And with regard to China:Munro’s research indicates, convincingly in my view, that the Soviet system of forensic psychiatry was transplanted to China during the 1950s and 1960s, thereby placing a small subset of psychiatrists at the intersection of criminal prosecution and psychiatric confinement, and importing a smoothly oiled process by which psychiatrists found that most offenders referred for assessment lacked criminal responsibility and committed them for treatment without any adjudication or judicial oversight. Eventually, in the 1980s, China also established a system of maximum-security forensic hospitals (Ankang), modeled after the Soviet “special hospitals,” for confining offenders who present a “social danger.”But lest you think that more open societies are immune to this insidious form of manipulation, consider our own messy history of psychiatric abuse. In 2010, a police officer was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for attempting to reveal what he said was the truth about falsified crime rate statistics. He was eventually paid $600,000 in a settlement by the City of New York after filing a $50 million human rights violation suit. Our foster care system stuffs victimized children full of psychotropic drugs in a thinly veiled attempted to make them easier to handle. Schizophrenia was allegedly used to deliberately hamper the rise of civil rights. Barry Goldwater was publicly crucified for his conservative views by a team of psychiatrists who disagreed with him politically; the Goldwater Rule still exists because attacking someone’s mental fitness is such a potent weapon.In supporting diagnoses that are nebulous and unproven, the World Health Organization is giving its tacit approval of an arguably unscientific diagnosis with endless potential for abuse around the world. At best, it could be an easy platform upon which to medicate individuals instead of identifying actual behavioral issues. At worst, it could be one more tool — easily applied to just about any connected citizen — for silencing the inconvenient.Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter.

by Charlie Nash31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn a Friday blog post titled “Rethinking Our Default Profile Photo,” Twitter explained how they settled on the placeholder image for new users.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“For the past seven years, everyone who has created an account on Twitter starts out with their default profile photo as an egg,” Twitter declared. “This was a playful way to reference how eggs hatch into birds that send all the Tweets you see on Twitter! But now it’s time for something new – something that encourages people to upload their own photos for more personal expression. So today, we’re introducing a new default profile photo.”“After deciding on a figure, we began our refinements. We had to determine how to bring inclusivity into our single default profile photo, given that we don’t require people to specify their gender on Twitter,” the company explained. “We felt that the circle of the head in the figure still seemed masculine, even though it technically had no design characteristics to indicate that it was a man. So for inspiration, we looked at how women are portrayed in generic, wayfinding iconography, such as bathroom signs, and noticed that the only difference between the sexes is the shape of their clothing.”“Regardless, people have come to associate the circle head with masculinity, and because of this association, we felt that it was important to explore alternate head shapes,” they concluded. “We reviewed many variations of our figure, altering both the head and shoulders to feel more inclusive to all genders. When the shoulders were wider, the image felt overly masculine, so we decreased the width of the shoulders and adjusted the height of the figure. As a result of these iterations, we ended with a more gender-balanced figure.”In the post, Twitter also claimed that they made the new default picture use a gray palette “to make this image accessible for those with visual impairments.”Several users mocked the announcement, including author and conservative activist Mike Cernovich.“This reads like a bad satire of corporate culture,” Cernovich declared. “It’s real, Twitter is not changing course, it’s getting worse.”This reads like a bad satire of corporate culture, it's real, Twitter is not changing course, it's getting worse. https://t.co/fKBsQQsvAY— Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) March 31, 2017Others pointed out the absurdity of Twitter focusing its attention of changing the default profile picture when there are larger issues that have sill not been addressed.It’s not a joke https://t.co/OTsODym84s pic.twitter.com/roau719XQm— Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 31, 2017Read the excruciating torture Twitter encountered when they realized their default avatar looked too "masculine". https://t.co/68uYW2tAXh— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) March 31, 2017This tells you everything you need to know about who runs Twitter and why EVERYTHING is now filtered through the lens of social justice.— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) March 31, 2017Twitter has human trafficking, terror networks operating on here, but they're focused on what's truly importanthttps://t.co/1XarwZVu7V— William Craddick (@williamcraddick) March 31, 2017Twitter says egg avatars were being associated w/harassment.

by AWR Hawkins31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis is not the first time campus carry has been sent to Deal’s desk. The Georgia House passed campus carry on February 22, 2016, and the state’s Senate followed suit on March 11. Deal campaigned for campus carry as it moved from House to Senate, only to do an about-face and veto it on May 3.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe point of contention in 2016 was that law-abiding concealed carry permit holders would be able to carry their guns into on-campus daycare facilities. Such facilities have been exempted this year in hopes of appeasing Deal and securing his signature. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that other exemptions “include dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, and buildings used for athletic events.”On March 28, Breitbart News spoke with Georgia Carry’s executive director, Jerry Henry, about the legislation. He said, “This is not the bill we wanted, but it is a step in the right direction. It will decriminalize carrying a firearm on a college or university campus. It moves the ball a little further down the road.”Deal is playing his cards close to his vest this time. He has not indicated whether he plans to sign the legislation or veto it again.Gov.

by AP31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCHICAGO (AP) — Two people have died in a drive-by shooting in the same Chicago neighborhood where separate shootings several hours earlier left five people dead, including a pregnant woman, police said Friday.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe latest shooting happened late Thursday when a vehicle pulled alongside a van in the city’s South Shore neighborhood. A man and woman were shot, police said, and the van crashed into a pole.“You lose count of the shootings after a while,” Kyra Carr, who lives a few blocks away and said she heard the gunfire, told the Chicago Sun-Times. “But seven bodies in a day. Crazy. Something is wrong.”On Thursday afternoon, four people were fatally shot in or near a restaurant after a man approached and opened fire. Two men were found dead from bullet wounds inside the restaurant. A third person was found unresponsive outside the restaurant.A fourth man who sustained gunshot wounds was found unresponsive a block away. All the victims were pronounced dead at the scene.Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter late Thursday that the shooting was likely a gang-related retaliation for “another incident” and detectives are making “good progress.”The Cook County medical examiner’s office identified three of the victims as brothers Raheem and Dillon Jackson, ages 19 and 20 respectively, and 28-year-old Emmanuel Stokes. The identity of the fourth victim was withheld pending notification of family.The Chicago Tribune reports that the Jacksons’ grandmother, Georgia Jackson, 72, said the two had gone to the restaurant to get food and to see their mother, who works there. She said their mother called her about the shooting.“She only said one at first but when I got here they said they found the other,” Georgia Jackson said.Earlier, about a mile from the restaurant, the body of 26-year-old Patrice L. Calvin was discovered in a home. The medical examiner’s office says Calvin, who was four months pregnant, suffered a gunshot wound to the head.No arrests have been reported by police.








by Chriss W. Street31 Mar 2017Newport Beach, CA0SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDespite Californians paying the highest sales and income taxes and the second highest gas taxes in the nation, Gov. Brown wants to raise the excise tax on distributors of fuel by 67 percent  — from $.18 per gallon to $.30 per gallon — and the annual vehicle registration fees by $25 for the next decade, according to SFGate. The equivalent cost per gallon of the combined taxes would jump to over $.88.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCommercial vehicles would be hit harder, with the excise taxes on diesel spiking from 20 cents to 36 cents a gallon, and diesel sales tax jumping from 1.75 percent to 5.75 percent. Beginning in 2020, even hybrid and electric cars would be socked with $100 a year fee.California’s transportation infrastructure consists of 50,000 lane miles of highways; 9 toll bridges; 12,000 other bridges,;11 million square feet of Department of Transportation offices; maintenance shops; 170 Department of Motor Vehicles offices; and 102 California Highway Patrol offices; according to the non-partisan Legislative Analyst’s Office.Collection of gas and excise taxes and registration fees used to pay for all transportation spending. But after the flood of cash from voters approving the $20 billion Proposition 1B transportation bond in 2006 and the $10 billion Proposition 1A high–speed rail bond in 2008, the legislature started diverting about 18 percent of transportation revenues each year to fund un-related state general obligation bond interest and principal payments.The National Transportation Group, which tracks national and local transportation spending, estimates that California’s abysmal infrastructure spending now costs state drivers an extra $56.3 billion a year in congestion, safety, and vehicle operating costs.Brown claims the new spending bill will only costs each Californian in the state about $10 a month, but that works out to about $500 a month for a family of four. Under state law, to pass such regressive and very unpopular taxes, Brown will need every vote from the state’s two-thirds Democrat majorities in both legislative branches.To cajole liberals into voting for spending $30 billion on roads and $4 billion for bridge repair, Brown is offering $7.5 billion for public transportation, $1 billion walking and bicycle paths, $2.5 billion to reduce major city road congestion, and $275 million for intercity-transit expansions, according to SFGate.Democrats still remember that Gov. Gray Davis was recalled for tripling vehicle registration fees in 2003, opening the door for Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger to become governor.

Doctors pronounced him dead an hour later.The boy’s mother and Lambing’s girlfriend, Mackenzie Peters, were charged with child endangerment Thursday in connection with the burn injury the boy suffered before his death, WTAE reported.Police searched for Lambing and found him in an attic of an abandoned building the next day, where police say his mother hid him.Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said he will decide after the preliminary hearing whether to seek the death penalty for Lambing.“I have never seen anything like it in 22 years as an attorney,” he told WTAE. “It’s horrific. It’s unimaginable that somebody could actually do this to any human being let alone a 4-year-old.”When a reporter asked Lambing before his court appearance Monday if he killed Miller, he appeared to cry and replied, “No sir.”Miller’s aunt has set up a GoFundMe page for his funeral expenses.Big Government, Law Enforcement, Pre-Viral, Bentley Miller, Butler, Child Endangerment, Crime, homicide, Keith Jordan Lambing, Kristen Herold, Mackenzie Peters, Pennsylvania, Rape

by AP31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the investigation involving Michael Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser (all times local):SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER___7:35 a.m.The chief spokesman for President Vladimir Putin says relations between the United States and Russia are at a very low ebb, perhaps exceeding Cold War-era hostility between Washington and Moscow.Dmitry Peskov tells ABC’s “Good Morning America” that reports of Russian meddling in America’s election amount to “fake news.”  Asked by anchor George Stephanopoulos if there is a “new Cold War,” Peskov replied, “Well, maybe even worse.” He said much of the current chill was caused by the Obama administration’s decision to expel Russian diplomats and confiscate property because of alleged hacking against American political institutions.Peskov also said Friday that Russian officials aren’t worried about what might emerge from any congressional testimony under immunity by ousted U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying there is “no evidence at all” of any improprieties.___7:45 a.m.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says it’s important for congressional investigators to get an idea of what information Michael Flynn has before considering whether to grant him immunity.Pelosi tells NBC’s “Today Show”: “We don’t want people to take an immunity bath at the Congress so that the Justice Department cannot make the case they may want to make against him.”Pelosi claims she’s not thinking yet about whether Flynn’s testimony could tie President Donald Trump to the Moscow government, and its alleged attempts to influence voters last year.She says, “I really don’t want to think that it’s about Flynn to get the president. This is about Flynn and Flynn.”___7:07 a.m.President Donald Trump says his former national security adviser, Mike Flynn, is right to ask for immunity in exchange for talking about Russia.Trump tweeted early Friday: “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!”Flynn’s attorney said Thursday that the retired general is in discussions with the House and Senate intelligence committees on receiving immunity from “unfair prosecution” in exchange for answering questions.Flynn was fired from his job as Trump’s national security adviser after it was disclosed that he misled the vice president about a conversation he had shortly after the election with the Russian ambassador.Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation.








by Nick Hallett31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAddressing the House of Commons on Thursday, Brexit Secretary David Davis told cheering Tory MPs the controversial European Charter of Fundamental Rights would be scrapped on the day Britain leaves the EU.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe measure will be part of the so-called Great Repeal Bill, which will transfer the majority of EU laws to the British statute book to ensure a “smooth and orderly” Brexit. The UK parliament will then be free to amend and repeal them as it sees fit.“A strong, independent country needs control of its own laws. That process starts now,” Mr. Davis said.Tony Blair took Britain into the Charter, which includes 50 “human rights”, in the year 2000.Critics have blamed these rights for making it harder to remove terror suspects and foreign criminals from Britain.Former justice minister and Leave campaigner Dominic Raab said: “Removing the Charter stops yet more skewed human rights obligations from being imposed on the UK via the European Court of Justice, which has weakened our ability both to stop dangerous criminals entering the UK, and remove them once they offend here.”Mr. Davis said the bill “enables the return to this Parliament of the sovereignty we ceded in 1972 and ends the supremacy of EU law in this country,” thus ensuring “power sits closer to the people of the United Kingdom than ever before”.Human rights legislation has been blamed for the failure to deport numerous criminals.Just last year, a group of terror suspects were allowed to stay in Britain following a challenge to their proposed deportation under the Human Rights Act.The men in question had been deemed a threat to national security due to alleged links to Al Qaeda. One was linked to a terror plot in the UK, while another is accused of having had “direct links” to Osama bin Laden.Breitbart London, Brexit, Brexit negotiations








by Chris Tomlinson31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe clash began at around 9 p.m. Wednesday when a group of 10 migrants, some Syrian and some Palestinian, got into a fight. Shortly after the violence began, the police arrived on the scene and most of the perpetrators fled leaving one individual with a head injury who was taken to a nearby hospital.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAt around 11 p.m., however, the violence erupted in the area once more when the migrants returned and began to smash the cars of local residents, many of whom are of a foreign background themselves. Around 40 to 50 locals left their houses to confront the mob, who threw rocks at the residents, as cries of “Allahu Akbar” were heard, Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung reports.Police say the majority of the residents involved had Lebanese, Turkish, or Kurdish origins.During the chaos, a police car was also hit by rocks thrown by one of the rioters. Police managed to eventually separate the two groups after a large deployment of officers arrived on the scene called in from other departments.Police say that only one man was arrested for resisting officers’ commands, and authorities have launched an investigation into several cases of bodily harm and property damage.The case is similar to what happened in the town of Bautzen last year when migrants rampaged through the city only to be confronted by locals. The fight involved around 20 migrants and 80 right wing supporters who shouted slogans at the migrants.Another fight broke out in Bautzen later in December at a Christmas market, once again between locals and asylum seekers. Police said the two groups came to blows after a heated argument. After they were finished fighting, the migrants caused hundreds of euros of damage to a car.Mass brawls between migrants have occurred in asylum homes as well, some of which have also been caught on film. One such brawl in Dortmund saw over a dozen migrants attack each other with chairs and other weapons leading to the hospitalisation of several people. Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart.comBreitbart London, Breitbart TV, Europe Migrant Crisis, Germany, Germany asylum seekers, mass brawl, Peine








by Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSo far this year, 655 migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean, which represents 2.4 percent of the total number who have attempted the perilous crossing. During the whole of 2016, the percentage of migrants who died in the Mediterranean was 1.4 percent, meaning that this year has seen a spike of nearly 42 per cent.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMore remarkably still, Mediterranean migrant deaths have accounted for more than half (57 per cent) of all migrant deaths worldwide in 2017, which have totaled 1,157 as of March 28.In the first quarter of 2017, a total of 26,589 migrants have successfully crossed the Mediterranean into Europe, mostly departing from North Africa and landing in Italy.According to recent reports, a number of humanitarian organizations and NGOs are coming under fire for effectively providing a taxi service for migrants, picking them up off the coast of Libya and shuttling them straight to Italy, despite the fact that international agreements would have them take the migrants to the nearest port.Last week, an Italian public prosecutor called for monitoring of the funding of NGOs engaged in rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea, because of their close collusion with the human traffickers behind much of the local immigration business.The remarks of the chief prosecutor of Catania (Sicily) followed closely on the release of a report by Frontex, the border control agency of the European Union (EU), suggesting that NGOs have been complicit with human traffickers by offering a shuttle service from North Africa to Italy.NGOs engaged in maritime rescue operations “help criminals achieve their objectives at minimum cost, strengthen their business model by increasing the chances of success,” the report said.The Italian prosecutor, Carmelo Zuccaro, said that whether or not the organizations in question are operating out of philanthropic motives, “the facilitation of illegal immigration is a punishable offense regardless of the intention.”A week ago, senior British diplomat Joseph Walker-Cousins accused the EU of doing “too little, too late” to address Europe’s ongoing migrant crisis.Testifying before the House of Lords’ EU External Affairs Sub-Committee, the former head of the British Embassy in Benghazi warned that “up to a million migrants, if not more, are in the pipeline. They will take a long time to work their way through that pipeline but it is well-established.”In a recent address, Pope Francis called Europe’s migrant crisis “the greatest tragedy since the Second World War.”Follow Thomas D.

by Chris Tomlinson31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMinister Müller said he is deeply concerned over the rise in migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe so far this year. In the first three months of 2017, the number of migrants has doubled from this period in 2016. Müller warned: “If we calculate this, 300,000 to 400,000 people could arrive in Italy this year,” Die Welt reports.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLast year a record 180,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean, and many thousands drowned on the way.  According to Müller, Europe needs to adopt a radically different approach to African migration. Along with Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, he reaffirmed a joint security agreement with countries in Africa this week.Defence Minister von der Leyen said: “Without security, there is no development and no development without security and no peace.” Both ministers urged the European Union (EU) to work closer with African nations politically, militarily, and economically.In January, Müller proposed the bloc should adopt a policy similar to the Marshall Plan which helped rebuild the German economy after the Second World War. He emphasised policies that would cut aid or put sanctions on countries for not taking migrants back, like the proposal backed by German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere,  could increase the number of people making the trip to Europe.Last year, Müller warned the migrant crisis had barely begun saying he thought there could be a further eight to 10 million people who would try and come to Europe from the Middle East.One politician who agrees that the migrant crisis is likely only beginning is President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, In a recent interview, Tajani said he thought there could be as many as 30 million more migrants from Africa coming to Europe in the next several years.Tajani, like Müller, said he thought the EU should be more active in Africa and said EU member states should invest billions into struggling African economies.The Geneva-based International Labour Organization (ILO) put out a report earlier this year saying the economies of African nations simply couldn’t keep up with their high birth rates which would inevitably lead to many migrating to Europe to find work.   Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart.comBreitbart London, Immigration, African migrants, Europe Migrant Crisis, Gerd Müller, Germany








by Virginia Hale31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERActivists argued the men are model students fluent in Swedish and lacking any criminal tendencies. They warned the Afghans would be forced into either the Taliban or sex slavery if made to return to their homelands.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA number of the migrants, who authorities judged to have no right to remain in the Nordic nation, were being deported for having lied about their age.But Kinna Skoglund, spokesman for We Can’t Bear It, a group which demands the government grant amnesty to unaccompanied minors, said she has no faith in the migration board’s age assessment methods.“There could be 15-year-olds sitting among the people who are about to be deported,” she said. “We want young people to be supported — not deported in silence to their certain death.”Around 60 Swedes gathered on Tuesday outside the Kållered building, where the Afghans were being kept, to try and prevent authorities from transporting them to the airport where their flight was due to leave at just before 10 p.m.According to the Gothenburg Post, protesters began to “riot” when a blue bus arrived for the migrants at around 6:30 p.m. and tried to rush through police fencing in an attempt to stop the bus.Some of the campaigners donned blankets “to show their solidarity” with the Afghans, and protesters were “screaming and crying as they tried to comfort each other”, the newspaper reported.Protesters then headed to Landvetter airport, where the men were due to be flown back to Afghanistan. Ms. Skoglund said authorities were making a mistake in choosing to deport them, insisting that the migrants “have the potential to be a great asset” to Sweden.A spokesman for We Can’t Bear It told reporters the deportees have been in Sweden between one and three years:They all speak Swedish and write the language fluently, so it is no problem to communicate with them, the spokeswoman said. All these young people are so incredibly ambitious. They were doing well in school. They entered the voluntary sector as quickly as they could. The child refugees with whom we have been in contact don’t have any criminal tendencies, aside from a very small number. On the contrary, they are model students.A grim future awaits them in Afghanistan, Skoglund added.“Most likely they will just flee to Sweden again,” she said. She warned the alternative was that “they may join the Taliban, who recruit boys to fight for them in exchange for food and shelter”.She suggested that another alternative would be for the men “to prostitute themselves”, telling reporters it’s become common for older men to recruit teenage boys into “sex slavery”.Activists at the airport argued the deportation would “trigger anxiety attacks” amongst unaccompanied minors living in Sweden, and could even inspire suicides.“These girls and boys will be thinking ‘next time, it could be me who’s put on a plane’,” said Ms. Skoglund, reporting that an ambulance had to be called to the Kållered migrant repository on Monday when one of the men “collapsed” from a “panic attack” and “couldn’t breathe”.But press officer Pierre Karatzian denied the incident, stating that the Migration Board “has heard of no such cases”.As the plane set off from Landvetter, protesters sang “Last Night I Dreamed” as they held a candlelit vigil.“Today we cry but tomorrow we will continue to fight,” Ms. Skoglund declared.>Så mycket smärta. #vistarinteut #amnestinu (fast för dessa individer är det redan för sent) pic.twitter.com/qt4UveWfAg— Vi står inte ut (@vistarinteut) March 29, 2017Här står de, några av kompisarna som tvingas se sin vän lämna landet, kravallstaket och polisbilar…  @vistarinteut ber om nåd för de unga pic.twitter.com/vYDPnyU6KS— Vi står inte ut (@vistarinteut) March 28, 2017På Landvetter nu för att protestera.

by Penny Starr30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Tuesday, Rev. Andrew Brunson gave the U.S. Embassy in Turkey a statement he hopes will reach the president’s desk.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWill the Turkish government face no consequence for stubbornly continuing to hold an American citizen as a political prisoner? Even though I have a long public track record as a church pastor, they falsely accuse me of being a member of an Islamist terrorist group. I have been imprisoned since October 7, 2016. During this time the Turkish government has produced no proof and has rebuffed numerous attempts by the American government to secure my return to the United States. In fact they are treating the U.S. government with contempt and paying no price for it.I plead with my government – with the Trump Administration – to fight for me. I ask the State Department to impose sanctions. I appeal to President Trump: please help me. Let the Turkish government know that you will not cooperate with them in any way until they release me. Please do not leave me here in prison.Brunson, a U.S. citizen from Black Mountain, North Carolina, has worked as a Christian missionary in Turkey for the past 23 years.The ACLJ told his story on its website after his arrest in October and launched a petition drive that has gathered more than 240,000 signatures.Pastor Andrew Brunson – a U.S. citizen from Black Mountain, North Carolina – was summoned to the local police station in Izmir, Turkey on the morning of October 7, 2016. He believed he would be receiving a long awaited permanent residence card.  Pastor Brunson, who is a U.S. citizen, has been living in Turkey for 23 years, running a Christian church with the full knowledge of local authorities.Upon arriving at the station, he was informed he was being deported based on being a “threat to national security,” a common excuse for deportation in Turkey.  It became clear that he was being arrested and would be detained until deportation.  He was fingerprinted, searched, and had his phone, pen, etc. taken away.  He was denied a Bible. But instead of being deported, he was held with no charges for 63 days, during which time he was denied access to his Turkish attorney.  He was placed in solitary confinement for part of this time, with his glasses and watch confiscated.Then on December 8th, after being detained for 63 days, things took a dire turn. In the middle of the night, Pastor Andrew was taken to a counter terrorism center in Izmir and then on to court.  He was questioned and has been falsely charged with “membership in an armed terrorist organization.” The charging documents state no “evidence has been gathered” against him. A Turkish judge had the option to deport Pastor Andrew, release him on weekly sign-ins at the local police station, or imprison him. The judge chose to remand Pastor Andrew to prison.”Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) traveled to the Turkish capital Ankara in December where he met with the department of justice officials, Fox News reported.“For the first time, we learned what these charges are,” Lankford told Fox News. “They were given to me orally.”Lankford told Fox News that the Turkish authorities alleged Brunson had helped Kurdish refugees — Turkey labels the Kurds an insurgent group — and that the pastor attended a conference put on by Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, whom the Turkish government accused of plotting the 2016 coup from Pennsylvania where he now lives.“We really, really want to get this case, my father’s case, to President Trump,” Brunson’s daughter Jacqueline Brunson told Fox News this month. “We really feel it would be helpful to have the president’s support and have him personally arguing for my father’s case to get him back home safely to his family.”The college student told WTVD-TV she’s has been forced to put off her wedding plans, Faithwire.com reported.“That’s kind of on hold because I want my dad to be able to walk me down the aisle,” she said. “I want him there.

I think when we’re in a state of war, when we’re in a state of mourning, you should take time off from the golf course.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERObama basically was a weekly golfer his entire second term, averaging nearly 48 rounds per year during that period with a high of 56 in 2014. Trump reportedly has been to his various golf courses 13 times in his ten weeks as president, but it is not clear he actually played on all those occasions, and administration officials say he takes calls and meetings on his visits.Pearl was killed in 2002 when George W. Bush was still president and Obama was still in the Illinois state Senate. McEnany was referring to James Foley, a journalist who was beheaded by terrorists in 2014. Obama was at Martha’s Vineyard at the time, where he issued a statement, then went golfing.“I apologize for using the wrong name,” McEnany said Wednesday on Twitter. “Both James Foley and Daniel Pearl lost their lives to terrorism & should be honored by our leaders.”Critics on the left pounced.“File under unbelievable if it wasn’t Trump surrogate and CNN analyst Kayleigh McEnany,” wrote John Amato at Crooks and Liars in a piece that called for her to be suspended. “She either is lying or confused. It’s so hard to tell with Kayleigh, because her sole purpose is not to inform, but to filibuster a segment with bluster so nothing against Donald Trump sticks in the viewer’s memory.”“Come on, Kayleigh,” added Joy Reid, an MSNBC personality.“CNN Trump Surrogate Kayleigh McEnany Botches Basic Facts While Ripping Obama,” crowed The Huffington Post.Ann Coulter came to her defense and put the mistake – McEnany acknowledges up front she is not sure she has the right name – in perspective.“Yes, it was after a different American was beheaded by a different Muslim,” Coulter tweeted. “Hard to keep them straight.”Big Journalism, Ann Coulter, CNN, Daniel Pearl, James Foley, Joy Reid, Kayleigh McEnany, President Obama, President Trump

by John Hayward30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe numbers of those troops may be approaching parity as well since NBC News observes the American presence in Syria was roughly a thousand strong in February, but “that number may have been boosted by the arrival of several hundred more in recent weeks to support the battle to route ISIS from Raqqa.” The Russians have somewhere between 1,600 and 4,500 troops in Syria.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNBC quotes Professor Andreas Krieg of the Defense Studies Department at King’s College London warning, “Escalation is bound to happen.”Krieg noted that surrogates such as the U.S.-allied Kurdish YPG militia are “doing their own operations and then the sponsors are doing air cover and artillery cover,” greatly increasing the risk of dangerous confusion.On the other hand, NBC correspondents report seeing Russian and Syrian forces, as well as American units, working outside the Kurdish holding of Manbij. Their mutual objective of keeping Turkey from moving its forces into Manbij appears to have been achieved. The YPG spoke of reaching an “agreement” with Russia in northeastern Syria.Several observers quoted by NBC News pointed out Russia’s interest in reinforcing its political narrative of joining forces to eliminate the Islamic State, instead of Western powers supporting efforts to topple the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. This would not only consolidate Russia’s interests in Syria but greatly enhance its international prestige.Evidently, Russia values those goals even more highly than its recently repaired relationship with Turkey, which views the Kurds as the greatest threat in Syria and is not fond of the Assad regime. A similar strategic predicament exists between NATO member Turkey and the United States, which has long been allied with Kurdish forces the Turks regard as terrorists.Even as U.S. and Russian troops get close enough to play badminton, a Russian general on Tuesday accused the United States of deliberately seeking to “completely destroy critical infrastructure in Syria and complicate post-war reconstruction as much as possible.”He was in part referring to the strategic Tabqa Dam near Raqqa, as well as some bridges across the Euphrates River allegedly destroyed by U.S. coalition jets. The coalition denied targeting the Tabqa Dam, whose collapse would be catastrophic and said no structural damage to the dam has yet been discovered.In better news, Russia has reportedly agreed to help the United States and Israel reduce Iran’s influence in Syria and expel pro-Iranian forces from the country. The Jerusalem Post describes this report as coming from a Kuwaiti newspaper that claims to have spoken with anonymous U.S. officials. Those sources said Russia is ready to begin withdrawing some of its forces from stabilized areas of Syria and leaving the Syrian army in charge.National Security, Iran, ISIS, kurds, Manbij, Russia, Syria, Turkey

Officials have not yet accepted the deal, the paper says.Details of what Flynn might be willing to say to investigators have not been made public.Flynn was appointed as then President-Elect Trump’s national security advisor in November of last year but resigned by February after revelations emerged that he had opened communications with Russian officials, communications about which he neglected to fully brief the vice president.In his resignation letter, Flynn apologized for neglecting to fully inform VP Pence about the discussions he had with the Russian ambassador saying the omission was due to the “fast pace of events.”At the time of the resignation, Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the administration let Flynn go not due to any legal issues but due to “a trust issue.” Spicer said that the “level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.”Flynn is facing pressure from several inquiries into his dealings with Russian officials which include thousands he was paid by a trio of Russian companies for speeches made before he joined Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, as well as his communications with the Russian ambassador.Flynn’s offer to testify comes as Democrats continue to press for investigations into ties Trump may have had with Russia.

Yes. Are we going to sit there and focus on getting him out? No,” she said. “What we are going to focus on is putting the pressure in there so that we can start to make a change in Syria.”Just this week, Cavusoglu said Turkey’s purpose in Syria has always been to defeat ISIS.“From the beginning, our target has been very clear,” Cavusoglu said. “We have been in Syria to defeat Daesh and to clear many cities in Manbij from Daesh and make those areas Daesh-free or terrorist-free zones.”Turkey has repeatedly called for the removal of Assad and, in November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan asserted that Turkish troops entered Syria to remove “the tyrant Assad who terrorizes with state terror,” but has softened his rhetoric in recent weeks as Turkey has worked with Russia to broker a peaceful end to the six-year-long civil war in Syria.“The increasingly close cooperation on Syria between Russia and Turkey marks a sharp turnaround for the two nations, which have also coordinated their operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL also known as ISIS) armed group in Syria,” Aljazeera reported  this month.“Russia has an active military presence in Syria in support of Assad’s forces, while Turkey, which backs anti-Assad groups, launched a military operation in August to create a safe zone along its border inside Syria,” Aljazeera reported.Jihad, Middle East, National Security, Assad, ISIS, Rex Tillerson, Russia, Syria, Turkey








by John Hayward30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“He’s not rational,” McCain told MSNBC host Greta van Susteren on March 22nd. “We’re not dealing even with someone like Joseph Stalin, who had a certain rationality to his barbarity.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMcCain called on China to control Kim, saying Beijing could “stop North Korea’s economy in a week” if it wanted to.North Korea’s Foreign Ministry responded that McCain (and his colleague Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who wants North Korea designated a state sponsor of terrorism) had insulted the “dignity” of the supreme leader.“What they uttered to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK is just a manifestation of their worst hostility toward the DPRK’s ideology and social system and its people and a grave provocation little short of declaration of war against it,” the Foreign Ministry said, as transcribed by the UK Independent.“The service personnel and people of the DPRK are regarding the dignity of their supreme leadership as their life and soul,” the statement continued:The US must know very well about how they react to any offensive acts against it. As such guys as John McCain and Ted Cruz made a provocation tantamount to a declaration of war against the DPRK, the DPRK will take steps to counter it. They will have to bitterly experience the disastrous consequences to be entailed by their reckless tongue-lashing and then any regret for it will come too late.The Foreign Ministry capped this tirade off with a direct threat, promising that North Korea will “fulfill its sacred mission” to deal a “merciless sledge-hammer blow at those daring to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership.”The UK Independent adds that a Foreign Ministry spokesman accused McCain of “blasphemy” and described McCain and Cruz as “puppies knowing no fear of the tiger.”McCain did not seem much intimidated by the threat. “What, did they want me to call him a crazy skinny kid?” he asked on Twitter.Unfortunately, McCain’s hopes for China to restrain North Korea’s corpulent leader are probably in vain. China banned its Internet users from referring to Kim by nicknames such as “Kim Fatty III” on social media. By the end of 2016, fat jokes about Kim were among the top 10 censored search terms on China’s Weibo service.On Wednesday, The Hill published an op-ed from former CIA director James Woolsey and Dr. Peter Vincent Pry, the chief of staff for the Congressional EMP Commission, warning that North Korea’s threats are not necessarily implausible. The authors said, “false reassurance” was delivered to the American people by claims that North Korea can’t build a miniaturized nuclear warhead or reliable ICBM yet.Woolsey and Pry contend that North Korea might already have nuclear ICBM capability, or be very close to it, and they can always find other ways to deliver a nuke to the U.S. mainland, such as hiding it aboard a freighter and sailing it into an American harbor.They also discuss the possibility of North Korea putting a small nuclear warhead aboard a satellite to carry out an electromagnetic pulse weapon attack. In fact, two North Korean satellites already pass over the United States in orbits that would work for an EMP attack.National Security, electromagnetic pulse, John McCain, Kim Jong Un, North Korea, nuclear weapons, Ted Cruz








by AFP30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSeoul (AFP) – South Korea’s ousted president Park Geun-Hye was arrested early Friday over the corruption and abuse of power scandal that brought her down.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Seoul Central District Court issued a warrant to arrest Park on charges of bribery, abuse of authority, coercion, and leaking government secrets, after a marathon court hearing the previous day.“It is justifiable and necessary to arrest (Park) as key charges were justified and there is risk of evidence being destroyed,” the court said in a statement.Park will immediately be taken from the prosecutor’s office where she has been awaiting the decision into custody in a detention centre near Seoul.The former leader was grilled for nearly nine hours in court Thursday as a judge deliberated whether she should be arrested.Looking grim-faced and pale, Park ignored a barrage of press flashbulbs and did not speak when she arrived at the Seoul Central District Court earlier in the day, nor when she left.Being taken into custody will be a dramatic step in the disgrace of South Korea’s first woman president, and is a key demand of the millions of people who took to the streets to protest against her as the scandal engulfed her leadership last year.The former president was stripped of her immunity when she was dismissed from office by the country’s top court earlier this month. Park, 65, has denied the accusations against her.Choi Soon-Sil, Park’s secret confidante at the heart of the scandal, is already on trial for forcing top local firms including tech giant Samsung to “donate” nearly $70 million to non-profit foundations which she allegedly used for personal gain.Ahead of the hearing, prosecutors submitted around 120,000 pages of documents to the Seoul Central District Court relating to the charges against Park, and said it would be “counter to the principle of fairness” if she was not arrested.“The accused is denying most of the charges, and there is a risk of destroying evidence in the future,” they said.Park becomes the third former leader to be arrested over corruption in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, where politics and big business have long been closely tied.Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-Yong, who was arrested last month in connection to the scandal, was in court for over seven hours for his hearing, and his detention was approved early the following day.Opposition lawmakers had called Thursday for Park’s arrest.  “The least she can do as the ex-president who damaged national dignity is to admit her criminal acts, bow her head and seek forgiveness,” said a spokesman for the main opposition Democratic Party.An election to choose her successor will be held on May 9. Moon Jae-In, her rival in 2012 and a former Democratic Party leader leads opinion polls by large margins.– ‘Sleepness nights’ –Park, daughter of late dictator Park Chung-Hee, secured the largest vote share of any candidate in the democratic era when she was elected in 2012.But she was impeached by parliament in December, as the scandal combined with mounting economic and social frustrations to trigger huge candlelit demonstrations. The Constitutional Court later upheld the decision.Last week she underwent a 21-hour interrogation session at the prosecutors’ office, having refused repeated requests to be interviewed while in power.She had been “lost for words” when authorities asked for her arrest, the Chosun Ilbo daily quoted an unidentified pro-Park lawmaker as saying.Another said she had been having “sleepless nights and skipping meals” since moving out of the presidential palace.Park allegedly offered governmental favours to top businessmen who enriched Choi, including Samsung’s Lee.She is also accused of letting her friend, a high school graduate with no title or security clearance, handle a wide range of state affairs including nomination of top officials.Park is also said to have cracked down on thousands of artists who had voiced criticisms of her or her father’s iron-fisted rule from 1961 to 1979.She has repeatedly apologised for the upset caused by the scandal but not admitted any wrongdoing, blaming Choi for abusing their friendship.








by Tom Ciccotta30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStudent Marshall Polston claims he was suspended after confronting a professor who Polston says taught that the historical Jesus Christ was never crucified. The professor also reportedly claimed that Jesus’s disciples did not believe that he was God.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPolston, who claims to be a good student, says that he received a failing grade on his first assignment following his dispute with the professor over Jesus’ crucifixion.In an email to the professor, Polston addressed his concerns about the grade. “Quite frankly the grade you assigned to me exposes your true agenda which is to silence me in class,” he claimed. “You’re one of the most incompetent professors I have ever seen in my life.”According to the March 24 suspension letter, administrators at the college accused Polston of posing a safety threat to the Rollins community. The letter claims that his “actions have constituted a threat of disruption within the operations of the College and jeopardize the safety and well-being of members of the College community and yourself.”“I made absolutely no threats,” Polston claims.A few classes later, Polston claimed that the professor engaged in a discussion with a Muslim student who argued that gays and adulterers should be beheaded under Sharia law.“I spoke out to the professor about the grade and subsequently the decapitation comments made by the student,” Polston told The College Fix. “The statement by the conservative Muslim student met such fear by some that one of the students reported it to the FBI. Later, I was reported by the professor to the dean of campus safety. The situation was surreal. We’ve already had one too many attacks in Orlando and as an avid traveler I realized this was the perfect example of ‘see something, say something.’”Areej Zufari, the professor, filed a “protection against stalking” request, claiming that Polston had repeatedly harassed her. Polston denies these claims.According to Zufari, Polston came to class after being suspended, a violation of the terms of his suspension. According to the campus safety report, Zufari claimed that Polston’s presence caused such a safety concern that she was forced to dismiss the class early.Student ______ stated to me that she looked out the back glass door of the classroom and saw Mr. Polston staring into the room. He briefly stopped then proceeded on his way. Campus safety was immediately notified and responded at 19:36 hours. A search was conducted but Mr. Polston was not found. Ms. Zufari’s students were upset and did not feel comfortable being in the class. Ms. Zufari dismissed her class early at 20:07 hours.Rollins president Grant Cornwell said the school would “never ever ever” suspend a student for over a civil disagreement with a professor, claiming that other factors led to the decision to suspend Polston, but that he couldn’t provide any more information at this time.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

by Virginia Hale30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“They went on the warpath,” said the managing director of the Reinickendorf kindergarten, detailing how parents organised to collect signatures against its employment of the man — who Der Tagesspiegel calls Christian Berger — demanding that he be fired.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNoting that all but one child who attended the daycare centre comes from a Muslim family, she said the parents “come from another world”, explaining that they see gay men as a danger.“We are living in 21st century Berlin,” said the manager, who runs four kindergartens in the German capital. She stressed there was no way she was going to sack a member of staff because of his sexuality.Berger told the German newspaper that many of the parents come from the Middle East and Turkey, stating: “For some of them, they think homosexuals are automatically child molesters.“As a gay man, one walks a fine line,” he said, adding that parents are “afraid” of his sexuality.“You touch the children, you dress them, you see them naked,” Berger told Der Tagesspiegel, which underlined that this is “the normal job of an educator”.The kindergarten’s manager, who didn’t wish to be named, told the newspaper that before meeting the gay teacher, parents were already unhappy about the prospect of their young children being looked after by a man.“Some of the parents were shocked” when it was announced at a parents’ evening that their children were going to have a male tutor, she said.“We don’t want a man to be helping our children get dressed and taking them to the toilet,” the manager recounted parents saying. Upon discovering the new teacher’s sexuality, they presented the kindergarten with a petition asking that he be fired.At a subsequent parent’s evening, to which Berger was not invited, a number of families warned they would remove their children from the centre’s care if it continued to employ the gay staff member.The managing director said parents who had the strongest objections have now withdrawn their children from the kindergarten, but Berger told the newspaper he still feels under undue suspicion in his job.“Parents are constantly looking at me,” he disclosed with some annoyance, according to Der Tagesspiegel. “We are constantly monitored, which makes it difficult to care for the children in an ordinary fashion.“Our role as kindergarten teachers is to help children develop in a healthy and normal way,” said Berger.The tutor added that it’s homophobic people ‘who are actually in need of help’, recalling how, on the subway recently, he heard a conversation between two men in which one said he would “find it disgusting” if his child had a gay teacher.Breitbart London, Faith, Immigration, Berlin, Germany, Germany Migrants, Islam in Europe, Muslims in Europe








by Michael Patrick Leahy30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Their crime: appearing on Fox TV’s Tucker Carlson Show to voice concerns about Islamic indoctrination of Chatham Middle School seventh graders,” the Thomas More Law Center said in a press release on Thursday.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“Libby Hilsenrath and Nancy Gayer were subjected to personal attacks throughout their campaign to stop Islamic indoctrination at the Chatham Middle School. They were defamed as “bigots” and “Islamophobes”, “hateful”, “ignorant”, “xenophobes”, “intolerant”, “racist”, “closed minded”, “sad and ignorant” in social media, and the list goes on. The attacks significantly intensified after their appearance on the Tucker Carlson Show,” the statement continued:Libby Hilsenrath and Nancy Gayer, with sons in different classes in the seventh grade, [first] detailed their concerns in person to the Chatham Board of Education at their February 6, 2017 public meeting.Superintendent Michael LaSusa indicated that any change to the curriculum was unlikely, and the next day also refused their request to meet privately with him to discuss their concerns.“The promotion of Islam is worse than what the mothers presented to Tucker Carlson,” Richard Thompson, President and Chief Counsel of the Thomas More Law Center said.“After viewing one of the videos which the seventh graders were directed to watch, I can’t imagine any objective person saying this is not Islamic indoctrination. Clueless school administrators across our nation are allowing this type of indoctrination to take place and it’s up to vigilant parents to stop it. Libby and Nancy should have been praised, not pilloried,” Thompson added.“Students had been shown a subtle propaganda cartoon video, 5 Pillars, which opens with two boys, one of them a Muslim, kicking a soccer ball,” the statement said, adding:The Muslim teaches the non-Muslim the 5 Pillars of Islam. Additionally, a subtitle of bright, multi-colored words of various shapes pronounces a form of the Islamic conversion creed: “There is no god except Allah and Prophet Muhammad is His messenger.” The cartoon ends with a sad non-Muslim boy, who suddenly smiles when the Muslim boy invites him to join him at the mosque for noon-day prayers. . .Clearly, seventh graders had been presented with a sugarcoated, false depiction of Islam. They had not been informed of the kidnappings, beheadings, slave-trading, massacres, and persecution of non-Muslims, nor of the repression of women — all done in the name of Islam and the Koran. “It’s just not fair that within this unit of study the Chatham school district taught one religion to the exclusion of all others, and for the community to be so unkind and unwelcoming towards us, just for having raised legitimate questions as concerned parents,” Gayer said.“One of my fundamental obligations as a parent is to guide the religious and secular education of my children. That’s why I will continue the fight against the Islamic indoctrination now taking place at Chatham, regardless of the personal attacks,” Hilsenrath added.“Libby Hilsenrath and Nancy Gayer asked the board to review the curriculum and requested that either the Islam lessons be removed or that the school spend equal time on the study of Christianity,” the statement concluded.Big Government, Education, Chatham Middle School, Islamic Curriculum, Thomas More Law Center

Bruce, who goes by the stage name Violent J, called it “Violent J’s Poem.”The Associated Press left a voicemail Thursday seeking comment from attorney Howard Hertz, who represents the Insane Clown Posse.








by AP30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMIAMI (AP) — President Donald Trump’s senior adviser Steve Bannon will not face charges related to his registration to vote in Miami despite spending most of his time elsewhere, Florida prosecutors announced Thursday.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Miami-Dade County State Attorney’s Office concluded in a memo that there was not enough evidence to prove any crime. Bannon registered to vote in the county on April 2, 2014 after leasing the first of two houses in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood, then switched his registration to the Sarasota area last year.Bannon never voted in Miami-Dade County, the prosecutors said. They also said there was insufficient evidence to prove Bannon falsely claimed to reside in Florida on a voter registration form, which is a felony.The memo says the amount of time a person spends at a given address is not proof alone of residence. Bannon spent much time while registered to vote in Florida in other states, most notably California and New York.“Especially in our increasingly mobile society, a person may spend the majority of his or her nights at one (or multiple) locations, but legally reside at another under Florida law,” the memo says. “The old adage of ‘where you lay your head is home’ is only part of the residency analysis.”Lawyers for Bannon didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. But in the memo, attorneys Thomas Scott and Ed Pozzuoli were quoted as telling investigators they had reviewed the matter and found “no actionable conduct” by Bannon.The investigation by the prosecutor’s Public Corruption Unit found that Bannon first leased a home in Coconut Grove in April 2014 along with his ex-wife, Diane Clohesy. Clohesy told prosecutors that Bannon did stay in the house from time to time between 2014 and 2016.Bannon’s office paid the rent and records also showed his name was on the lease and on another lease for a separate home in the same area, which he rented in January 2015. Bannon also took out accounts with utilities in his name for those residences.Miami political consultant A.J. Delgado told investigators she met with Bannon at the first home and saw “boxes, papers and effects in the house that indicated to her that (he) was living at the house.” Delgado also said Bannon referred to the place as “my house.”Bannon also had an active California driver’s license, the investigation revealed, but the address had not been updated since March 2013. Bannon also was linked to several other properties in New York and California but none were listed as his main residence for tax reasons, the memo says.To prove a violation, prosecutors concluded they would have to prove Bannon did not intend to live in Miami-Dade County when he originally registered to vote in 2014.“The investigation did not uncover sufficient evidence to do so,” they wrote._____Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt








by Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe report underscored the importance of subjective judgments in the process of fact-checking, amply borne out by numerous examples where fact-checking organizations betray significant political and cultural biases in their assessments.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe results of the study, executed by Daniele Scalea of the Machiavelli Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Rome, were presented at the Italian Parliament Wednesday during an academic conference on the topic of fake news and journalism.Many of the errors proceed from broadening the scope of fact-checking to include statements that express opinion, analysis or prediction.Since fact-checkers do not limit themselves to appraising objectively verifiable assertions, the study revealed, they pronounce judgments not only about facts, but also about what attacks are fair, what arguments are reasonable, what forecasts are probable, and what language is appropriate.In the majority of cases, the report continues, fact-checkers weigh the validity of arguments, rather than checking facts. This exercise involves significant space for human error and entails a good dose of subjective opinion, despite the pretension of impartial analysis.As Glenn Greenwald had already noted in a 2011 essay titled “PolitiFact and the scam of neutral expertise,” Politifact “undermines its own credibility when it purports to resolve subjective disputes of political opinion under the guise of objective expertise.”“What matters here more than PolitiFact’s obvious, specific errors,” Greenwald noted, “is the reason they were led to such error: namely, reliance on supposedly neutral, ideology-free ‘experts’ who are anything but that.”Fact-checkers even evaluate predictions, the new study noted, which fall completely outside the realm of verifiable or falsifiable data. For instance, in 2011 PolitiFact evaluated the claim by Rick Perry that “when you sanction the Iranian Central Bank, that will shut down [Iran’s] economy.” PolitiFact judged the statement to be “half true,” because in their opinion the move would have “uncertain effects” and it’s not “proven” that Iran’s economy would shut down.Ironically, an attentive reader wrote in to PolitiFact to point out a truly factual error in the same PolitiFact article, and the fact-checker was obliged to issue a public correction of the mistake.In another humorous example, the fact-checkers at NBC News pronounced judgment on a claim by Donald Trump during the presidential debate that Hillary Clinton had “acid washed” her mail server. NBC called the claim false because Hillary had used a program called “BleachBit” to expunge her server of potentially damaging material rather than physically bathing the hard disk in corrosive acid.Also in 2016, the Associated Press Fact Check declared that Donald Trump was “wrong” to say that Syrian President Bashar Assad fights the Islamic State. Yet the same AP had published a headline a few months earlier stating “After Palmyra, Syrian Troops take another IS-controlled town,” underscoring the inroads that the Assad government had made in fighting ISIS.Using these and other examples, Scalea mounted a persuasive case for the unreliability of today’s fact-checking services, which are often directly or indirectly tied to other journalistic interests.The report also found that professional fact-checkers are subject to market forces similar to the rest of online journalism, and must fight against competing fact-checkers for page-views and ratings.As Joseph Uscinski noted in a 2013 essay, fact-checking “is actually just a veiled continuation of politics by means of journalism.”The report is especially relevant today as Facebook continues forward with plans to evaluate material posted on its social media site and remove items it judges to be fake news. The panel of assessors used by Facebook comes from the very people responsible for egregious errors in fact-checking in the past.Follow Thomas D.

Details to come. #YAFonCampus pic.twitter.com/07ytXLMvEf— YAF (@yaf) March 28, 2017However, one of the event’s organizers, Pranav Jandahyala, told CBS San Francisco that the group are “pretty apprehensive right now about everything,” but “truly believe [they] can put on a great event.”The rioting before Yiannopoulos’s event in February received worldwide attention, as left-wing anarchists destroyed campus property; smashed local ATMs and bank windows; looted a Starbucks; attacked Trump supporters; pepper-sprayed innocent individuals; and set fires in the street. Others spray painted the words “Kill Trump” on storefronts.This time, however, organizers plan to provide more robust security, to honor the tradition of free speech at Berkeley since the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s.“This time we are definitely going to push them to provide more security than they did last time. More officers on the ground instead of in the balcony,” Jandahyala said.In a statement, UC Berkeley said that Coulter’s invitation “in no way suggests our endorsement of a particular point of view, and we will continue to affirm our commitment to the values of diversity, equality, and tolerance that underlie the greatness of Berkeley and, indeed, of our nation.”However, the university did reaffirm its commitment to free speech, stating that it does not prohibit events “based on a generalized concern that a speaker’s message may trigger disruptions.”Jandahyala also added that the event will be a chance to ignite heated discussions, where attendees will have the opportunity to challenge Coulter’s views.“So what I challenge you to do is actually confront her. If she comes to speak on campus and there’s no challenge to her viewpoint and people resort to violence and maybe she doesn’t speak, her views go unchallenged,” he continued.You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.comBreitbart California, Education, Ann Coulter, campus intolerance, College Republicans, free speech, Riots, UC Berkeley, Young America's Foundation








by Dr. Susan Berry30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe allegations led to multiple congressional investigations. Ultimately, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Select Investigative Panel have referred Planned Parenthood Federation of America, several of the largest Planned Parenthood affiliates in the country, and three of their business associates in the fetal tissue procurement industry to the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra charged David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt of the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) with 15 felonies. The charges were filed following the release of their latest explosive video showing Planned Parenthood officials allegedly discussing how they obtain the highest quality fetal body parts during abortions in order to maximize sales to biotech companies.Becerra is a former longstanding Democratic congressman who became attorney general after his predecessor, Kamala Harris, was sworn in as a U.S. senator. According to OpenSecrets.org, Becerra received a total of $5,535 from Planned Parenthood during his congressional election bids between 1998 and 2014.Harris is on record as having received $2,600 in 2016 from Planned Parenthood for her Senate race campaign. Additionally, Harris was the recipient of $39,855 from the Abortion Policy/Pro-Abortion Rights lobby group, according to OpenSecrets.org. ElectionTrack.com reported Harris received $15,000 from Planned Parenthood for her attorney general campaign bids.A Los Angeles Times column by Robin Abcarian on March 25, 2016 criticized Harris for dragging her feet on Daleiden’s case.Abcarian wrote:It took a Texas grand jury only two months to reject claims that Planned Parenthood had illegally trafficked in fetal tissue, and instead indict two antiabortion activists whose elaborate plans blew up in their faces. That was some swift poetic justice.But what’s taking California so long?In July, our politically ambitious attorney general, Kamala Harris, vowed to “carefully review” the “Center for Medical Progress.”Just weeks later, Harris’s deputies seized Daleiden’s personal property following months of investigation into his videos.The Washington Examiner reports the mainstream media is “silent” on the Planned Parenthood contributions to the campaigns of Becerra and Harris, and observes as well that Lia Parada, a former aide to Becerra, is currently working as a Planned Parenthood lobbyist.As Breitbart News reported, emails obtained by the Washington Times in September of 2016 showed that Harris’s office collaborated with Planned Parenthood to produce the California legislation criminalizing undercover journalists for publishing and distributing recordings of private communications with abortion providers.According to the Times:The documents are another indication of Ms. Harris‘ close relationship with Planned Parenthood and call into question the impartiality of her ongoing investigation of Mr. Daleiden, legal experts said.The emails show Beth Parker, chief legal counsel for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, sending multiple drafts of AB 1671 to Jill Habig, who was at the time special counsel to the attorney general.“Attached is the language for AB 1671, proposed amendments to Penal Code section 632,” Ms. Parker wrote in an email marked March 8. “I look forward to your thoughts about this.”Ms. Parker sent a revised draft of the legislation to Ms. Habig on March 16. “Here’s the rewrite of the video tape bill,” she wrote. “Let me know what you think.”Habig later became deputy manager of Harris’ U.S. Senate campaign. The campaign website featured a petition asking voters to support and protect Planned Parenthood’s federal funding.Charges brought against Daleiden and Merritt in Harris County, Texas – under suspicion of bias – were ultimately dropped. One of Planned Parenthood’s biotech partners, StemExpress, also backed off a lawsuit against the videomakers.In an interview with EWTN, Daleiden said the current charges against him “are really bogus, in a lot of ways.”He added:The charges are all based on the California recording law, which is not triggered and isn’t an issue so long as the conversations that are being taped are public conversations happening out in the open, in a public area, which every last video tape that’s referenced in the attorney general’s complaint was. So we weren’t expecting them to file such a, really such a weak case, a case that probably won’t survive a couple of motions to dismiss.“When it comes to felony charges against our client, David Daleiden, history is on our side,” said Tom Brejcha, president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Society, which is representing the journalists. “When David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt were falsely charged in Texas, after they mounted a vigorous defense, the charges were abruptly dropped. We expect that the same will prove true in California.”Brejcha added that the efforts of Daleiden and Merritt “were furtherance of First Amendment values and are clothed with the same Constitutional protection that all investigative journalists deserve and must enjoy. Undercover journalism has been a vital tool in our politics and self-governance.”In CMP’s most recent video, Planned Parenthood abortionist Dr. DeShawn Taylor allegedly describes to the video journalists how she delivers intact fetuses during late-term abortions. Taylor also explains the difficulties abortionists face when a baby comes through the procedure with signs of life, and she complains about the laws in a “conservative” state like Arizona, where she once served as medical director of a Planned Parenthood facility.“In Arizona, if the fetus comes out with any signs of life, we’re supposed to transport it. To the hospital,” she says.When asked if there is “any standard procedure for verifying signs of life?” Taylor responds by saying, “The key is, you need to pay attention to who’s in the room, right?”Abortion, Big Government, Breitbart California, California, California Attorney General Kamala Harris, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Center for Medical Progress, cronyism, David Daleiden, Planned Parenthood videos, Rep.

by Ian Hanchett30 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDuring a speech at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden argued that in 2016, the Democratic Party “did not talk what it always stood for, and that is how to maintain a burgeoning middle class.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBiden stated that he thinks the choice between protecting American jobs and engaging with the world is “exaggerated.” He added, “Look, in a sense, we wouldn’t be having this conversation about American jobs, in the way it’s just been phrased, legitimately, by the president, were it not for 171,000 votes, 171,000 votes in four states, that put us in this position.”Biden continued that 2016 was the first campaign he could remember “where, my party did not talk what it always stood for, and that is how to maintain a burgeoning middle class. And the truth of the matter is, you didn’t hear a single solitary sentence in the last campaign about that guy working on the assembly making $60,000 a year, and the wife making $32,000 as a hostess in a restaurant…and they’ve got two kids, and they can’t make it, and they’re scared, and they’re frightened.” He further stated that while on the macro level, globalization has been a phenomenal success, but it has “left people behind.” And the global system is something the US needs more than anyone in the world.Biden later said, “[Y]ou know, all those angry white men, you know, we talk about, that are racist. Guess what? Barack and I won them. Let’s get this straight. It wasn’t racist. They voted for a black man, twice in a row, but they didn’t this time. They didn’t this time, because they look out there, and they’re scared and no one’s talking to them.”He also stated President Trump “has not created any jobs. He’s not going to create many jobs.” He also argued that it’s a “false choice” to try and decide between focusing on the white working class and being progressive.(h/t Dan Merica)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, globalization, Joe Biden, Middle Class








by John Hayward31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMarlow asked Cuban about his “Radical Transport” Kickstarter campaign to create hoverboards with two key features previous products lacked: they will be made in the U.S., and they will not explode.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER“It’s made in the United States. We have a few parts we have to import, that we couldn’t make here. It’s going to be assembled in Dallas, so it’s going to be made with a lot more care,” Cuban explained.“We’re UL-approved, which the previous boards out of China were not,” he noted. “Everything is redesigned. It’s all-new intellectual property. The previous hoverboards, they were designed to push the price down, be as inexpensive as possible, and appeal to as many kids as possible. We’ve taken a completely different approach: All-new intellectual property, a whole new design. It’s a lot more responsive. It’s a lot safer from a manufacturing perspective.” “It’s a lot more oriented toward high-performance riders, if you will. Believe it or not, there’s a group of people who don’t just want to ride them around the house or the driveway. They want to do tricks and kind of be an alternative to skateboards. That’s the market we’re going after, so they’ll be a little bit more expensive, too,” he said.Cuban said that in all of his companies, “we’re not allowed to buy anything overseas until we’ve priced it here in the United States first.”“There are some products we just can’t get here, like with the Mavericks, I can’t get my T-shirts all made here. They’re twice as expensive. But anything else, all the tchotchkes, whatever we give away, it always has to be priced here in the United States, just in case something’s changed. If it’s even close, the tie goes to the U.S.A. company,” he said.Marlow saluted Cuban, a supporter of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and critic of President Donald Trump, for appearing on Breitbart News Daily.“I like facilitating dialogue between people who disagree,” said Marlow. “You’d be shocked at how hard it is to get Hillary supporters to come on a show like this and talk to me.”Cuban in turn applauded Marlow and the Breitbart News Daily crew for welcoming such guests when they do appear.“I agree with you. I take the same approach. I don’t need to go and talk to people who agree with me. We already agree,” he said. “I learn from people who disagree with me. I call it checking my hole card: you know what you have underneath there, but you’re always checking to make sure you’re still being consistent in your thoughts. I want people to challenge me. That’s how I get smarter. That’s how I learn.”“I try not to be an ideologue about anything. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong, and I’m willing to evolve. Coming on a show like this is a great opportunity for me,” he added, stressing that he was not a partisan for the left or the Democratic Party, but an independent.Cuban agreed with Marlow that the healthy exchange of ideas was vital, especially in a time when so many people are living in ideological bubbles or actively calling for the suppression of speech with which they disagree.“I don’t know if there’s necessarily a ‘crackdown’ on free speech, but I do agree with you that we kind of insulate ourselves and tend to live in our own little bubbles,” he said. “We tend to see the news with which we agree. To me, that’s a real problem. It was a problem during the election, and it continues to be.”“When we have two people that disagree or groups that disagree, if we can have an open dialogue, we both get a chance to get a little smarter, and that’s always a good thing,” he said.Cuban said he could not divulge the details of his private meeting with White House strategist and former Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon months ago.“The heart of the matter is, I’ve known Steve since the late 90s, early 2000s, when he was in the entertainment business, so it was just a chance to catch up,” he said. “He ran a company called The Firm, which did a lot of work in Hollywood, so I had occasion to meet with him. We have a good relationship. But again, like us, we don’t have to agree on everything, but we can certainly discuss it all.”Marlow asked if President Trump’s success was inspirational as Cuban pursues his own political ambitions or if it “terrifies you that Trump is the president.”“I would say it inspires me because we’re so different,” Cuban replied, after laughing at the phrasing of the question. “I think the commonality is that we’re both businesspeople, but we take a completely different approach to how we do business. If you’ve read anything I’ve said, I haven’t been a big fan of his approach. I have been a fan of some of his economic policies.”“I’m trying to be open-minded and see what works and what doesn’t work,” he said. “A lot of my – I wouldn’t call them political aspirations, but more willingness to get out there and talk more about these things – is just from my desire to learn and my desire to do what’s best for the country.”Cuban added that as an entrepreneur, he has “a desire to try to help create as many jobs as possible.”“These days, more than ever, politics and entrepreneurship intersect,” he observed.He thought it was not quite right to say that he and Trump are similar in background and personality but diametrically opposed politically because there are issues upon which they agree.“I believe in lower taxes. I believe in more efficient government. I believe in reducing bureaucracy. I believe that we shouldn’t have lobbyists who can go in or former government workers who can come back and lobby. So in a lot of respects, we’re very much the same,” he said. “I disagree with him on trade, but I think he’s evolving his trade position. You know, he’s backed off on NAFTA. He’s backed off on the border adjustment tax stuff, at least from initial appearances. He’s not been as aggressive on trying to not work with other countries,” Cuban said of Trump.“I think there’s a lot of things that we’re on the same page about, but those are more conservative values, I think, than they are Donald Trump values. Where I disagree with him vehemently is that he doesn’t do a good job of communicating, and I don’t think he has great leadership skills. I say that based off of a long history in investing in companies and working with a lot of different corporate leaders. That’s where I really take issue with him,” he explained.Cuban strove to make a distinction between President Trump’s ability to draw large crowds at his rallies and the kind of leadership skills to which he was referring.“Going to a rally is part of an entertainment and part of a social gathering. More power to him, right? Whether there’s 15 or 50,000, more power to him for bringing them in, more power for getting them excited. He is a good marketer. He gets credit for that,” Cuban allowed. “But once you get the job – this may not seem like a great analogy, but trying to get an investor, whether it’s from Shark Tank or me or anybody investing in your company, that’s an accomplishment. But once you get the investment, you have to run the company profitably,” he continued. “You have to be able to execute on the things that you’ve said the company is going to do.” “Donald Trump going out there and holding rallies. That’s him bringing in the investors, the voters. Now that he’s been elected, it’s time for him to execute and be a leader and try to take the entire country – not just the people who voted for him – to a place that’s best for the United States. That’s the challenge for him right now, from my perspective,” he said.Cuban observed that Trump “didn’t campaign as a politician, but he’s becoming a politician.”“I think there’s a variety of business leaders, from Bill Gates to Warren Buffett to – not Mark Zuckerberg, but Sheryl Sandberg, people that I respect as businesspeople. Howard Schultz,” he added, offering some examples of the leadership style he believes Trump should emulate. “Put aside their politics. They’ve taken companies that have tens of thousands – even Rex Tillerson, right? People have taken companies with tens of thousands of employees, and despite the varied political viewpoints of those employees, have put them working together towards a common goal that has led to significant accomplishments for the company and for the people at that company,” he said.“That’s the position he’s in right now, that he’s got to achieve. That’s where a lot of people had hoped he would be able to deliver with business acumen and business skills as a leader. I don’t believe he has,” Cuban said of Trump.Marlow asked if Cuban would agree Rex Tillerson was a “bold pick of the president, to put a CEO into the secretary of state position.”“I have no problem with it. I thought it was a good pick, simply because Rex has managed 75,000 people,” Cuban said. “I had no problem with that pick at all. But now, look at whether Donald Trump, President Trump, is letting Rex Tillerson do his job. We haven’t seen Rex Tillerson stand up and say, ‘This is my vision for the State Department.’ We haven’t seen him stand up. Where he’s stood up and spoken has almost been a contradiction to what the president has said in terms of policy.” “And so you’re starting to see that bifurcation, those challenges between the people that he’s picked for these cabinet positions and the positions they’re taking when they’re out there doing their jobs and the positions the president has taken when he’s tried to communicate with the people. That’s a problem. That’s a leadership issue,” he argued.Turning to some specific issues, Marlow brought up health care, which he noted Cuban has referred to as a “right.” He asked Cuban to explore that logic by explaining why people don’t have an equivalent “right” to food and housing.“Let’s take a step back,” Cuban began. “First of all, we all have to eat, we all need a place to live, and we all get sick. We all play that genetic lottery. No one dies healthy. You’re going to get sick. Everybody you know is going to get sick.”“The decision we make as a country is, how much are we going to help people when they get sick? Because when someone gets sick and they don’t have the means to pay for their health care, we pay for it anyway,” he contended. “You pay for it. I pay for it. All taxpayers pay for it, one way or the other. There’s nobody who gets sick and we just let die. There’s nobody that gets sick and there’s no economic consequences.” “So from my perspective, the question isn’t is it a right because it’s in the Constitution, or why not food, why not everything else. The question is, what’s the best economic course for the United States? What’s the best economic course for the American people?” he asked.“The reality is, given we all have to pay for everybody’s health care – whether it’s directly or indirectly – I’d rather see us just take on this problem and say, ‘Let’s do it’ in the most cost-efficient manner.”“And because health care, really, we all face the same genetic risk. We all face the same randomness of life risk, where you can be in an accident, et cetera, when you’re able to spread the cost among everybody for – not all healthcare issues; if you sprain your ankle, that’s on you. If you break your finger, that’s on you, right? But if you get a chronic illness, if you get a serious illness or life-threatening illness, that’s something I think we should all share the cost in because we all face the same unknowns and the same risks,” he said. “And when we have people that fall through the cracks, and we don’t pay for them, we end up paying more indirectly. When someone has to go to the hospital because they don’t have insurance – and by the way, I think the insurance companies should be out of the mix altogether – but when someone needs health care and they don’t have the ability to pay for it, in our communities, we end up paying for it one way or the other. That means my property taxes go up. That means sales taxes go up in order to pay for a local hospital, local medical services, et cetera,” he said. “I would rather just all of us recognize that these are shared risks and share in paying the costs – not for all healthcare issues, like I mentioned, but for chronic and serious injuries and healthcare problems. For everything else, just leave a free and open market. You’re taking the greatest cost away from the insurance companies,” Cuban said. “Now, the insurance companies will hate it because they’re making twenty percent,” he added. “They make a twenty percent VIG off of all those costs. Their net income might only be about seven percent, but when insurance companies are doing $180 billion or $160 billion in revenue, that could fall to $30 billion. So they’re going to hate this idea.” “But the reality is, we all pay for each others’ health care, directly or indirectly,” he stressed. “As a businessperson, as an entrepreneur, I’d rather just say, ‘What’s the best way to solve the problem of health care?’ rather than just putting it all into the government as, ‘Okay, you come up with Obamacare or an alternative.’ I don’t think that’s the right way to do it.”Another issue Cuban has been involved with is student loan debt. “We’ve got a problem, and I’ve been speaking about this for years,” he said. “I said the same thing to Obama when Secretary Clinton came out with her suggestion that all student loans should basically be dismissed and college should be free. I said that was a bad idea. I told her that was a bad idea.”“Right now, I think the cost of tuition has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, simply because there’s too much easy money to be borrowed for tuition,” he explained. “Now, I have no problem with Pell grants. I have no problem with basic loans, up to $5700, I think it is. But what’s happening now is, private lenders are lending to families thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollars per year in some cases. And because that money is so easy to borrow, it’s really easy just for colleges to continue to increase their tuition.”“I’m not suggesting that we dismiss all loans that students have, even though that’s what some people would like,” he emphasized. “But what I am suggesting is, if we’re going to arrest the increases and inflation in college tuition and living expenses, we’re going to have to end the easy money.”“Whatever the number is, I’d like to see a cap on the amount of money that a family could borrow in any given year and in total,” he suggested. “If you do that, the easy money stops for colleges. They have to become more efficient.” “Right now, particularly big public universities, they’ll have more administrators making over $200,000 a year than they have teachers or professors making over $200,000 a year,” Cuban pointed out. “The economics are just wrong in universities. They’ll have a sociology building, a psychology building, a business building – none of which has unique features that are required for their teaching purposes, but they’re there just because a donor paid for them. I think all that just creates tuition inflation, and that needs to change.”Cuban disagreed with Marlow that too many university resources are devoted to liberal arts classes that have few applications in the working world.“I think right now the argument could be made that liberal arts majors aren’t going to make as much, and it’s far more difficult to get a job,” he countered. “But we’re going to go through a complete change in the nature of work over the next five to ten years.” “What’s happening with artificial intelligence and its derivatives and robotics, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks – if you work for software, or if you are in a position that you’re doing the same job, or it’s a repetitive job, over and over, or if you’re in a rules-based job – if this, then that – there’s a good chance your job’s going to be displaced over the next ten years,” he predicted. “As we get more into a machine learning/deep learning environment, we’re going to need more free thinkers who know how to use data than we’ll need people who maybe were bookkeepers or accountants, even some lawyers. Those jobs, because they’re rules-based, there’s not going to be a need for those. We’re literally going to have machines more capable of doing that. It used to be that we told machines what to do. Now we’re asking machines what to do,” said Cuban.Marlow clarified that he was concerned about students who incur enormous debt earning degrees that offer them no real prospect of repaying the debt through gainful employment. He cited someone he knows personally who incurred $200,000 in student loan debt to earn a Women’s and Gender Studies degree, realized it was of little use to her career ambitions, and started over as a medical student, studying alongside his wife.“Two questions there,” Cuban responded. “One, she went to the wrong school. She went to a school that was too expensive. She didn’t go to a school she could afford. That was the first issue, and that was her choice. She’s obviously dealing with the consequences.”“Two, it’s all going to change. We don’t know what the best jobs are going to be in ten years, for the reasons I mentioned earlier,” he continued. “Between robotics and deep learning/machine learning, not to get too technical, the nature of work is going to change. There’s going to be significant displacement. I don’t have a relationship with the administration, but the people I know that work in and around the White House that I have been able to talk to, that’s the overriding theme that I’ve been preaching to them.”“This goes back to an issue I have with President Trump: he doesn’t have a curiosity to learn. He doesn’t a quest for knowledge,” Cuban charged. “Part of that has led to his excitement over creating factories and what he calls ‘bringing in jobs.’ The reality is – write this down – look at the companies that he is saying are opening up factories, and make a note for their total employment the day he makes an announcement – whether it’s Ford, GM, whoever it may be. And then two years from now, look at the total employments for those companies. I guarantee you, the total number of employees for those companies will be down because the factories that President Trump is so excited about will lead to fewer jobs, not more jobs.” “Technology marches on,” he mused. “That’s not a bad thing. I’d rather have that technology be hosted in the United States, where we have some level of control over our own destiny, than those factores be created in China where they are being created, and they are changing the cost and the nature of work there already. The point being that unless you recognize the changes and disruption that are coming in the very short term, it’s going to be very difficult to say, ‘Okay, this is the type of classes you should take.’” “And so I’ve said publicly, I don’t have a problem with a women’s studies major if they’re smart, if they’re inquisitive, if they’re willing to continue to learn. I tell this to all my friends and their kids, et cetera, and my own kids – my oldest is 13 – the greatest skill that you can have is a thirst for knowledge, loving and learning how to learn because things are going to be changing so dramatically over the next ten years in terms of technology that we don’t know what the best jobs are going to be. So we’re all going to have to continue to learn how to find new skills,” he said.“Now, your wife and her friend, they’re in great shape. You talk about, going back a little bit to health care, if it was up to me, one of the programs I would start is a program that paid to have more doctors because if we’re going to push down the cost of health care, we should subsidize the cost of medical school – not to any amount that the school would charge us, but offer your wife $50,000 a year, and make it available not just to her, but so that instead of there being 90,000 med students in school in any given year, there are 180,000 med students in school in any given year. We spend the $900 million or $1 billion a year, whatever it may be, knowing that that increased competition, because we have more doctors, is going to push down the cost of medical care,” said Cuban. “Those are the types of things that I think, if we start to anticipate what’s coming down the pike in the future, we can be smarter and have an impact on health care, on insurance costs, on medical costs. There’s just so many things that we can do. Again, I’ll go back to the president: these aren’t the types of conversations that are being held in the White House. They’re looking backwards to the way things used to be and trying to recreate those, as opposed to looking forward to the way things should be,” he said.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:Radio, 2016 election, artificial intelligence, automation, Breitbart News Daily, Donald Trump, Education, health care, Hillary Clinton, mark cuban, student loans








by Pam Key31 Mar 20170SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFriday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” NBC’s “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd said President Donald Trump must accept “the fact” that Russia interfered in this election or he will be “on the brink of becoming a temporary lame duck presidency.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTodd said, “You have a presidency right now that I think is, it’s beyond saying it’s in crisis mode, it’s, you know, it’s on the brink, the question is on the brink of what? Is it on the brink of collapse? Is it on the brink of becoming a temporary lame duck presidency? Maybe it feels lame-duckish temporarily right now. You’ve got a stalled agenda. Republicans who have no fear of this president right now. They don’t think there’s a political penalty to buck him. Obviously, the Russia cloud darkens all of the time, and all of these problems right now that they’re dealing with front and center are self-inflicted by one person, the president of the United States who could not help himself with a tweet on this wiretapping nonsense.”“That essentially helped unravel ten days of all things Russia in their part of this story,” he continued. “Then throw in the fact that he has decided to drive a wedge in his own party by going after the Freedom Caucus. Okay, but he also attacking Democrats at the same time. He has to go find a dance partner and he is alienating both of his potential dance partners on that front. On the normal political scale, he has problems. Throw in the fact that you have a president that cannot accept the fact that Russia interfered in this election. Until he accepts that fact, it will plague him. The world must be panicked that if he is tested right now by a Putin in the Baltics, by North Korea, is the United States prepared to lead in a crisis right now for the world?”(h/t RCP Video)Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNENBreitbart TV, Chuck Todd, Donald Trump








U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Friday that North Korea’s “reckless” actions must be stopped.Defense Sec. Mattis: North Korea's 'Reckless' Actions Must Be Stopped https://t.co/36460KZ1CW pic.twitter.com/bNh6LGuRWW— Mikael Thalen (@MikaelThalen) March 31, 2017 Speaking beside British Defense Minister Michael Fallon at a London press conference, Mattis alluded to North Korea’s growing nuclear weapon and missile programs in response to a reporter’s question on Iran.“At the time when I spoke about Iran, I was the commander of the U.S. Central Command and that was the primary exporter of terrorism… the primary state sponsor of terrorism and it continues that kind of behavior today, but in the larger scheme of things… the North Korean threat, this is a threat of both rhetoric and growing capability,” he said.The issue, Mattis asserted, is currently being weighed with the assistance of allies as well as the United Nations.“We will be working with the international community to address this, we’re doing so right now, we’re working through the United Nations, we’re working with our allies, and we’re working diplomatically including with those that we might be able to enlist in this effort to get North Korea under control,” he said.“But right now it appears to be going in a very reckless manner in what its conduct is portraying for the future, and that’s got to be stopped.”Mattis’ comments come only one week after U.S. defense officials say North Korea carried out its latest missile engine test.Satellite images from March 25, analyzed by Washington-based think tank “38 North” Tuesday, may also indicate that North Korea is in the final stages of preparations for a sixth nuclear test.The think tank concluded that numerous factors presented in the photographs “strongly suggests that test preparations are well underway,” but cautioned there was no definitive evidence of a nuclear device being present at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated earlier this month that the policy of “strategic patience” has ended, noting that all options, including military, are now on the table.“Certainly, we do not want things to get to a military conflict… but obviously, if North Korea takes actions that threatens the South Korean forces or our own forces, then that would be met with an appropriate response,” Tillerson said. “If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe that requires action, that option is on the table.”









Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and six of her “research aides” retained access to classified and top secret documents years after she resigned from the State Department in 2013, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, launched an inquiry into the matter Thursday, citing Clinton’s “extremely careless” handling of classified information as concluded by FBI Director James Comey last summer.“I have repeatedly asked the State Department whether Secretary Clinton and her associates had their clearances suspended or revoked to which the Obama Administration refused to respond,” Grassley said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. “Recently, the State Department informed the Committee that six additional Secretary Clinton staff at State were designated as her research assistants which allowed them to retain their clearances after leaving the Department.”Unbelievably, Clinton’s justification for retaining access was that she needed classified info to help write her memoir, Fox News reported.Grassley went on to say that any government workers who’ve “engaged in serious offenses” would at a minimum have their clearances suspended.“The failure to do so has given the public the impression that Secretary Clinton and her associates received special treatment,” he pointed out.Chris Farrell, of watchdog group Judicial Watch, said that it is “outrageous” that Clinton and her aides could still have access after they left the State Department, especially given her past impropriety with classified information.“It is so unimaginatively offensive that Hillary Clinton or her staff would have any access to classified or top secret information,” Farrell said. “It is a mindblower.”In July 2016, FBI Director Comey, after investigating Clinton’s private email server, announced that “although we did not find clear evidence that that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.”

WikiLeaks’ latest batch of documents, named ‘Marble’, details CIA hacking tactics and how they can hamper forensic investigators from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the spy agency . The tool was in use as recently as 2016.The third release, which contains 676 source code files for the agency’s secret anti-forensics framework, is part of the CIA’s Core Library of malware, according to a statement from WikiLeaks.RELEASE: CIA Vault 7 part 3 "Marble" https://t.co/M5NBFlXRu4 #Vault7 pic.twitter.com/HFyEf26FHK— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 31, 2017 WikiLeaks said Marble hides fragments of texts that would allow for the author of the malware to be identified, meaning the agency allows another party to be blamed for the hack.A Marble framework document reveals it supports the ability to “add foreign languages” to malware. “Now comes the fun stuff,” it reads, listing Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi in example code, indicating the potential for the CIA to divert attention to international actors.It’s “designed to allow for flexible and easy-to-use obfuscation” as “string obfuscation algorithms” often link malware to a specific developer, according to the whistleblowing site.“This would permit a forensic attribution double game, for example by pretending that the spoken language of the malware creator was not American English, but Chinese, but then showing attempts to conceal the use of Chinese, drawing forensic investigators even more strongly to the wrong conclusion,” WikiLeaks explains, “But there are other possibilities, such as hiding fake error messages.”Within @wikileaks #Vault7 #Marble release, instructions on adding foreign language to algorithms to hide #CIA malware & hacks #dnchack pic.twitter.com/gsyh4Y4Gwt— Christine Maguire (@_ChrisMaguire) March 31, 2017Within @wikileaks #Vault7 #Marble release, instructions on adding foreign language to algorithms to hide #CIA malware & hacks #dnchack pic.twitter.com/gsyh4Y4Gwt— Christine Maguire (@_ChrisMaguire) March 31, 2017 The code also contains a ‘deobfuscator’ which allows the CIA text obfuscation to be reversed. “Combined with the revealed obfuscation techniques, a pattern or signature emerges which can assist forensic investigators attribute previous hacking attacks and viruses to the CIA.”Previous Vault7 releases have referred to the CIA’s ability to mask its hacking fingerprints.WikiLeaks claims the latest release will allow for thousands of viruses and hacking attacks to be attributed to the CIA.RELEASE: CIA Vault 7 Part 3 "Marble" — thousands of CIA viruses and hacking attacks could now be attributed https://t.co/MfNtlwEoZS #Vault7 pic.twitter.com/2SVNR3v7Ll— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 31, 2017RELEASE: CIA Vault 7 Part 3 "Marble" — thousands of CIA viruses and hacking attacks could now be attributed https://t.co/MfNtlwEoZS #Vault7 pic.twitter.com/2SVNR3v7Ll— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 31, 2017 








Leftists on Twitter have identified yet another shocking example of the re-emergence of white supremacy and racism in America – white colored Skittles.The social network giant was flooded with tweets expressing outrage at the fruit-flavored chewy candy being sold without colors.“This is soooo fucking stupid. Why should whiteness mean equality?!” said one Twitter user.“Skittles realized how white/capitalist PRIDE was becoming and wanted to join in the efforts. Interesting,” said another woman.“Damn, Skittles turning against the coloreds too,” added another.Some of the tweets received hundreds of retweets.“Shoulda been brown or black. I aint eating no white skittles,” said another woman.White Skittles are nothing new – they were promoted last year to celebrate Obama declaring June “LGBT Pride Month,” so it’s unexplained why race obsessives are suddenly up in arms now.The fact that the candy is white has nothing to do with race and is in fact a nod to the kind of mindless, virtue-signalling identity politics that ‘Black Lives Matter’ supporters would normally embrace.Skittles introduced the new color because, in their own words, “only one rainbow deserves to be the centre of attention – yours. And we’re not going to be the ones to steal your rainbow thunder, no siree.”However, the demand that everything has to be filtered through the lens of the ‘Oppression Olympics’ has brought with it the relatively recent trend of social justice warriors eating their own.This has led to some on the far left denigrating LGBT causes as a distraction from the supposed oppression of black people (a phenomenon that objectively does not exist).SUBSCRIBE on YouTube:Follow on Twitter: Follow @PrisonPlanetFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.

The social media speech police have arrested another innocent victim as Twitter just banned popular Trump supporter and Breitbart contributor @PizzaPartyBen with no warning or reason given, despite an impeccable record and over 72,000 followers.As has become their modus operandi, Twitter killed the account in the middle of the night, causing an uproar with his friends, fans, high-profile admirers and free speech advocates in the alternative media.“I woke up at 2am my time and had over 200 text messages asking about what happened,” Ben told Infowars.
Yesterday, Ben posted, “I’m Muslim now,” which was likely the excuse Twitter had been waiting for to banish him, despite the fact that Ben could very well have been serious, and thus Twitter could be accused of practicing ‘Islamophobia.’“Nothing Jack Dorsey does will change the fact that Donald Trump is our president,” Ben told Infowars, referring to the Twitter CEO and kingpin social justice warrior who has made it a mission to knock Trump supporters off his platform, such as Ben’s close friend, Milo Yiannopoulos.
Ben is also famous for his love of firearms and the 2nd Amendment, often posting photos of himself shooting rifles in his home state of Alaska, which has likely earned an even bigger target on his back with the anti-conservative social media giant.Ben was recently attacked in a hit piece on Donald Trump by Vox , who baselessly called him an “anti-semite,” which would make his close friendship with the Jewish Yiannopoulos quite peculiar and contradictory.Shortly after, Vox issued a retraction.“Vox Media was forced to issue a humiliating correction and apology today after falsely labelling popular social media figure, Donald Trump supporter, and Breitbart contributor ‘Pizza Party Ben’ an anti-Semite, after Breitbart challenged the website to justify the label,” reported Breitbart.“Twitter broke the #1 rule: don’t mess with dudes that wear makeup,” warned Ben.The social media platform, once loved as a tool for speaking freely and sharing thoughts with like-minded users, has chosen to purge non-leftist voices from the site, which has lead to a steep decline in the company’s value in recent years.Dan Lyman: Facebook | Twitter









Video footage out of Kuwait shows a maid hanging from a window before she falls onto a roof in what some are pointing to as an example of how foreign workers are mistreated in Islamic countries.“Hold me! Hold me!” the woman, who is reportedly Ethiopian, screams in Arabic. She then loses her grip and falls at least seven floors onto a lower roof. At no point does the individual filming the incident make any attempt to help her.This is how Arabs treat their maid ???? pic.twitter.com/2fFuPn018X— ??

(@Ali_loco1) March 30, 2017The woman who filmed the incident was reportedly arrested.The BBC reports that the maid climbed outside because she was suicidal and that the woman recorded the incident “because she did not want to be accused of the maid’s murder if she had died.”However, Twitter users were quick to assert that the incident highlights the mistreatment of immigrant workers in Muslim countries.In many Islamic countries, particularly Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, maids are treated like slaves and forced to work in abhorrent conditions.As Alya Mooro writes, sexual abuse and harassment of domestic workers is commonplace in rich Arab Gulf states because foreign maids are at the mercy of employers who exercise control over their visa terms.“This often allows the employers to feel like they have complete control over the maid and will not be reprimanded for however they choose to treat them,” explains Balqesa Maalim, a program officer at the International Organization for Migration.We also featured this video yesterday which showed veiled Muslim women being literally herded by a man with a stick in Saudi Arabia.SUBSCRIBE on YouTube:Follow on Twitter: Follow @PrisonPlanetFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.








WASHINGTON, D.C. – Google is running a silent campaign to make sure President Trump appoints as permanent chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a candidate the tech giant is certain will never press an antitrust investigation of the company, after previously lobbying for a Republican favorable to Google to be nominated by President Bush as the third GOP FCC commissioner.This is especially important given the steps the Trump administration took to advance a bill through Congress to cancel the FCC order on “Internet Privacy” that President Obama engineered in October 2016 at the urging of Google.That the White House was not abandoning Internet privacy, but transferring the rule-making on Internet privacy from the FCC to the FTC was made abundantly clear by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer at the White House briefing on Thursday.“The White House supports Congress using its authority under the Congressional Review Act to roll back last year’s FCC rules on broadband regulation,” Spicer said.“The previous administration, in an attempt to treat Internet service providers differently than edge providers, such as Google and Facebook, reclassified them as common carriers — much like a hotel or another retail outlet — and opened the door to an unfair regulatory framework.  This will allow all service providers to be treated fairly and consumer protection and privacy concerns to be reviewed on an equal playing field,” Spicer continued.It is important to understand Google wanted President Obama to place all broadband under Title II of the Communications – a move that allowed the FCC to regulate the Internet, resulting in the Democratic-controlled FCC imposing “Net Neutrality” rules and “Internet Privacy” rules.Typically, “Net Neutrality” was designed to tip the scales toward Google and the largest telecommunication giants on the Internet, while “Internet Privacy” rules allowed Google to continue mining and selling customer data from web-browsing activity analysis, while smaller ISPs were blocked from doing so.Infowars.com has reported the uproar attacking the GOP in Congress revoking the FCC “Internet Privacy” rules is led by leftist groups funded by Google and Soros.The Trump administration appears determined to reverse “Net Neutrality” rules as well as “Internet Privacy” rules promulgated by the Obama administration FCC, returning Internet privacy regulation to the FTC, the agency properly tasked with promulgating consumer protection rules.Industry insiders say one of Google greatest fears is that the Trump administration might open an antitrust investigation, like the antitrust investigation of Microsoft in 1998 when it attempted to incorporate its own Internet browser, making it difficult for users to load successfully competing browsers such as Netscape.In a Department of Justice settlement reached on Nov. 2, 2001, Microsoft agreed to place restrictions on its Windows operating system, having narrowly escaped a decision by the U.S. District court that Microsoft was a monopoly that needed to be broken into two companies to prevent Microsoft from using ever again its market power to crush competitors, including Apple, Netscape, Java, Lotus Software, Linux, and others.Interestingly the case U.S. v. Microsoft Corporation, 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001) began as an antitrust complaint initially filed with the FTC in 1992.Although the FTC is authorized to have five commissioners with no more than three of the same political party, at present the FTC has only two commissioners: Maureen K. Ohlhausen, a Republican appointed by President Obama in 2010, who President Trump elevated to be Acting Chair on Jan. 25, 2017; and Terrell McSweeney, a Democrat, appointed by President Obama and sworn in on April 28, 2014.Behind the scenes, Google is quietly pushing for Ohlhausen, a life-time career bureaucrat, to be appointed permanent FTC chair.Google calculates that Ohlhausen’s Republican views favoring robust open-market competition in a deregulated environment will be enough to get President Trump to appoint her as permanent FTC chair.But Google’s true calculation is that Ohlhausen as FTC chair would protect Google from being forced to undergo renewed antitrust inspection.Google knows that Ohlhausen dissented to an FTC settlement reached in 2013 to an antitrust complaint that involved various Google business practices, with the settlement requiring Google to share patents on critical standardized technologies needed to make popular electronic devices, such as smart phones, laptops and tablet computers.A “puff piece” supporting Ohlhausen to be nominated permanent FTC chair was published by James Cooper, a professor at George Mason University, who published in Forbes on March 29, an article featuring Ohlhausen’s “Economic Liberty” agenda, as derived from remarks Ohlhausen delivered at the George Mason Law Review’s 20th Annual Antitrust Symposium on Feb. 23, 2017.George Mason University (GMU) financial ties to Google were evidenced by a 2016 Campaign for Accountability’s Google Transparency Project report that noted four of five speakers appearing on a GMU panel on the global antitrust investigations of Google had received funding from Google.That report noted that Cooper’s program at GMU has received at least $762,000 in donations from Google and internal emails published by the media showed Google lobbyists trying to place an op-ed he wrote in newspapers and suggesting panelists for a conference he organized, with the cash payment apparently made in return for Cooper writing “a raft of papers supporting Google’s position that it had not broken antitrust laws.”On Feb. 23, 2017, Bloomberg BNA (formerly known as the Bureau of National Affairs) published an article entitled, “Ohlhausen Seen Auditioning to Keep Top FTC Role,” noting that Ohlhausen “has been speaking and tweeting a lot about her vision of the agency under President Donald Trump – a sign to some observers that she may be auditioning for a long-term leadership role.”As hard as Google has lobbied behind the scenes to promote Ohlhausen, Google has worked overtime to smear Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes – a Republican nominee for FTC chair who campaigned strongly for Trump in western states during the 2016 presidential campaign.“His appointment [i.e., Reyes] might be encouraging to people who want to see stronger antitrust enforcement than you’d normally expect in a Republican administration,” Seth Bloom, an antitrust attorney at Bloom Strategic Counsel LLC in Washington, told Bloomberg BNA.On Jan. 29, 2016, Reyes joined D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine in writing to then-FTC chair Edith Ramirez, suggesting the antitrust investigation the FTC closed against Google in 2013 should be reopened, in light of antitrust authorities in the EU and India pursuing complaints against Google similar to the complaints the FTC investigated and settled in 2013.On Aug. 17, 2015, Google lost a strong ally on the FTC when Commissioner Joshua D. Wright, a Republican, abruptly announced his resignation as FTC commissioner, a position he had held since January 2013.Although he led the transition team of then President-elect Trump that focused on the FTC, Wright has faced criticism for his outright support of Google, as evidenced by a paper he wrote in 2010 that was highly critical of the prospect Google might face the type of aggressive antitrust action the European Union had taken against high-tech companies, including Qualcomm, Intel, and Microsoft.









Feminists in Stockholm are leaving areas like the notorious migrant-heavy no-go zones of Husby and Tensta because they say religious fundamentalists now rule those suburbs.Nalin Pekgul is a self-described feminist and former member of parliament for the left wing Swedish Social Democrats. For over 30 years, she lived in the Stockholm suburb of Tensta but says that she no longer feels safe there. She claims Muslim fundamentalists have taken over and she doesn’t feel she can visit the centre of Tensta without being harassed, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.According to Ms. Pekgul, the situation for women in public life in the area has deteriorated over the past several years. She noted that there has been a rise in religious fundamentalism amongst the men in the area, many of whom come from migrant backgrounds. Pekgul attempted to combat the trend by organising coffee shop meetings but soon abandoned the idea.“In Tensta I am a known face and I have no desire to stir up trouble when I get harassed,” Pekgul said explaining why she no longer goes into the centre of the suburb. When asked if she will remain in the suburb, she said: “I always hope that it will blow over. One should never forget that the vast majority here are cursing the fundamentalists.”Zeliha Dagli, a former Left Party politician, did end up moving from the no-go suburb of Husby. Dagli described Husby as having self-appointed “morality police” who attempt to control women’s behaviour in the area.Aggression toward feminists, in particular, became an issue she said. “There were rumours that we wanted to take away women’s veils,” she said. “They said that I should keep myself, and then I did not feel so safe anymore.”Read more









The Prince of Wales has visited the site in Bucharest from where the infamous Vlad the Impaler ruled his citizens.Charles toured the ruined area in the Romanian capital’s old town that was home to the 15th century ruler and is now part of a museum complex.Charles saw the statue of the 15th century nobleman – famed for impaling his enemies on stakes – and the ruined remains of his royal court when he toured the historic quarter of Bucharest.The Prince was taken on a guided tour by architectural historian Valentin Mandache.They stopped in front of the imposing statute of Vlad – said to be the inspiration behind Bram Stoker’s Dracula – and discussed it for a few moments.Mr Mandache said afterwards: “I made a bit of joke that he’s his ancestor. I was saying the statue was put there in the 1970s.Charles’s bloodline can apparently be traced to the man who inspired the classic vampire horror story.Read more








In its search for a viable solution to end the conflict in Syria, the United States is no longer insisting upon the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson indicated Thursday.Tillerson’s position represents a 180-degree change from that of the Obama administration, which since 2011 had insisted any plan for Syria’s future exclude Assad.Tillerson, at a meeting with Turkish officials and in response to a direct question about Assad’s fate, said times have changed.“I think the status and the longer-term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people,” Tillerson said.On Thursday, Tillerson was asked about the ability of the U.S. and Turkey to “overcome your differences … and … move forward concretely in Syria in the fight to retake Raqqa.”Tillerson said the U.S. and Turkey are allies.Read more








German prosecutors have charged an Afghan migrant with the murder and rape of a 19-year-old medical student in Freiburg.The suspect already served a prison term for a similar offense in Greece but was released early.Officials in the southwestern German city of Freiburg, home of one of Germany’s elite universities where the incident had taken place, announced the charges on Thursday.The prosecution team accused the suspect known as Hussein K. of having “attacked, strangled and raped” Maria Ladenburger, a 19-year-old medical student who disappeared while on her way home from a party on October 16, 2016.The prosecutors claim he then dumped her in the nearby Dreisam River. Her body was found on the river bank the next morning by locals.The prosecution’s charge described Hussein K. as having killed Maria “insidiously and for sexual satisfaction,” DPA news agency reported. Hussein K. was linked to the crime through DNA evidence — authorities used a strand of hair found in the bushes near the girl’s body to identify and arrest him.Hussein K. had arrived in Germany from Afghanistan as an unaccompanied asylum-seeker in 2015, with no identity papers, and had been living with a Germany foster family since. At the time of his arrest, he told police he was 17 years old. However, two studies by medical age experts suggest the suspect was at least 22 at the time of the crime.Due to the uncertainty under German law, Hussein K. will be tried as a juvenile instead of adult law. His case will be heard by the juvenile chamber of the Freiburg district court. If convicted of murder, he could be handed a10 year jail term, DPA reports.The case sparked public outcry after journalist and author Oliver Janich said he discovered that the murder victim was Maria Ladenburger, daughter of Clemens Ladenburger, who has been an assistant to the Director-General of the European Commission’s Legal Service since 2008. It also emerged that Maria had worked as a volunteer in one of the local refugee shelters in her spare time, helping people like Hussein.The outrage grew louder when it was revealed that Hussein K. had previously been detained on charges of murdering a woman in Greece. According to police, he raped a Greek student and threw her off a cliff on the isle of Corfu in May 2013. He had been sentenced to ten years in prison but was released prematurely only two-and-a-half years into his sentence in October 2015, following a Greek law to ease prison overcrowding.A date for Hussein K.’s court appearance has not yet been announced. His background has risen questions about why European police had failed to identify and pick up his trail after he left Greece.









Norine Brunson, the wife of an American pastor jailed on bogus terrorism charges in Turkey, had little hope of meeting with Sec. of State Rex Tillerson in Ankara this week.But the North Carolina native flew to the Turkish capital city anyway because she already had a plane ticket, and Andrew, her husband, had told her that he felt that God had told him she would meet America’s top diplomat.And it turned out that he was right.“On Monday, Andrew told me he felt the Lord had said I would meet with Sec of State Tillerson. On Tuesday, I was told by the embassy and another senator that the meeting would NOT happen. I decided to come to Ankara anyway and arrived last night,” Norine Brunson wrote on Facebook Thursday, just after she met for 20 minutes with Tillerson.Tillerson, a former CEO at ExxonMobil, had shown no indication that he would meet with Brunson. His only scheduled event was with Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.It is not clear what was said in the meeting or if Tillerson discussed Brunson’s case with Erdogan. Reports of the meeting focused on discussions about the civil war in Syria.But Jordan Sekulow, the executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), says that Tillerson’s meeting with Norine Brunson is a positive development in the case to help free Andrew.“This is a powerful sign that the Trump Administration is taking the plight of this wrongfully imprisoned U.S. citizen very seriously,” said Sekulow, who is working to help free the pastor.It is not clear what was said in the meeting or if Tillerson discussed Brunson’s case with Erdogan. Reports of the meeting focused on discussions about the civil war in Syria.But Jordan Sekulow, the executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), says that Tillerson’s meeting with Norine Brunson is a positive development in the case to help free Andrew.“This is a powerful sign that the Trump Administration is taking the plight of this wrongfully imprisoned U.S. citizen very seriously,” said Sekulow, who is working to help free the pastor.Read more









Are millions of Americans about to see the big, juicy pensions that they were counting on to fund their golden years go up in flames in the biggest financial disaster in U.S. history?When Bloomberg published an editorial entitled “Pension Crisis Too Big for Markets to Ignore“, it simply confirmed what a lot of people already knew to be true.  Pension funds all over America are woefully underfunded, and they have been pouring mind boggling amounts of money into very risky investments such as Internet stocks and commercial mortgages.  Just like with subprime mortgages in 2008, this is a crisis that everyone can see coming well in advance, and yet nothing is being done about it.On a day to day basis, Americans generally don’t think very much about pensions.  Most of those that have been promised pensions simply have faith that they will be there when they need them.Unfortunately, the truth is that pension plans all over the country are severely underfunded, and this has already resulted in local fiascos such as the one that we just witnessed in Dallas.But what happened in Dallas is just the very small tip of a very large iceberg.  According to Bloomberg, unfunded pension obligations on a national basis “have risen to $1.9 trillion from $292 billion since 2007″…As was the case with the subprime crisis, the writing appears to be on the wall. And yet calamity has yet to strike. How so? Call it the triumvirate of conspirators – the actuaries, accountants and their accomplices in office. Throw in the law of big numbers, very big numbers, and you get to a disaster in a seemingly permanent state of making. Unfunded pension obligations have risen to $1.9 trillion from $292 billion since 2007.As was the case with the subprime crisis, the writing appears to be on the wall. And yet calamity has yet to strike. How so? Call it the triumvirate of conspirators – the actuaries, accountants and their accomplices in office. Throw in the law of big numbers, very big numbers, and you get to a disaster in a seemingly permanent state of making. Unfunded pension obligations have risen to $1.9 trillion from $292 billion since 2007.And of course that $1.9 trillion number is not actually the real number.That same Bloomberg article goes on to admit that if honest math was being used that the real number would actually be closer to 6 trillion dollars…So why not just flip the switch and require truth and honesty in public pension math? Too many cities and potentially states would buckle under the weight of more realistic assumed rates of return. By some estimates, unfunded liabilities would triple to upwards of $6 trillion if the prevailing yields on Treasuries were used. That would translate into much steeper funding requirements at a time when budgets are already severely constrained. Pockets of the country would face essential public service budgets being slashed to dangerous levels.So why not just flip the switch and require truth and honesty in public pension math?

That would translate into much steeper funding requirements at a time when budgets are already severely constrained. Pockets of the country would face essential public service budgets being slashed to dangerous levels.So where are all of these pensions eventually going to come up with 6 trillion dollars?That is a very good question.Ultimately, even if financial conditions stay as stable as they are right now, a whole lot of people are not going to get the money that they were promised.But things will get really “interesting” if we see a major downturn in the financial markets.  According to Dave Kranzler, if the stock market were to fall by 10 percent or more and stay there for a number of months, that “would cause every single public pension fund to blow up”.  And Kranzler is also deeply concerned about the tremendous amount of exposure that these pension funds have to commercial mortgages…Circling back to the mall/REIT ticking time-bomb, while the Fed can keep the stock market propped up as means of preventing an immediate nuclear melt-down in U.S. pensions (all of which are substantially “maxed-out” in their mandated equities allocation), the collapse of commercial mortgage-back securities (CMBS) will have the affect of launching a nuclear sub-missile directly into the side of the U.S. financial system.The commercial mortgage market is about $3 trillion, of which about $1 trillion has been packaged into asset-backed securities and stuffed into yield-starved pension funds. Without a doubt, the same degree of fraud of has been used to concoct the various tranches in these CMBS trusts that was employed during the mid-2000’s mortgage/housing bubble, with full cooperation of the ratings agencies then and now. Just like in 2008, with the derivatives that have been layered into the mix, the embedded leverage in the commercial mortgage/CMBS/REIT model is the financial equivalent of the Fukushima nuclear power plant collapse.Circling back to the mall/REIT ticking time-bomb, while the Fed can keep the stock market propped up as means of preventing an immediate nuclear melt-down in U.S. pensions (all of which are substantially “maxed-out” in their mandated equities allocation), the collapse of commercial mortgage-back securities (CMBS) will have the affect of launching a nuclear sub-missile directly into the side of the U.S. financial system.The commercial mortgage market is about $3 trillion, of which about $1 trillion has been packaged into asset-backed securities and stuffed into yield-starved pension funds.

In 2007, margin debt shot up to $381.4 billion in July, three months before stocks topped.Prior periods when margin debt hit records occurred around stock market peaks, including 2000 when the dot-com stock boom went bust, and 2007 when stocks began to crater amid early signs of trouble in the housing market ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.Margin debt jumped 22% from the end of 1999 before peaking in March 2000 at $278.5 billion, the same month stocks peaked.

A new study on the recent fact-checking trend to separate “fake news” from real reporting found that in the majority of cases, the fact-checkers are just as subject to bias as the news they evaluate.The report underscored the importance of subjective judgments in the process of fact-checking, amply borne out by numerous examples where fact-checking organizations betray significant political and cultural biases in their assessments.The results of the study, executed by Daniele Scalea of the Machiavelli Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Rome, were presented at the Italian Parliament Wednesday during an academic conference on the topic of fake news and journalism.Many of the errors proceed from broadening the scope of fact-checking to include statements that express opinion, analysis or prediction.Read more








Connecticut lawmakers are considering whether the state should become the first in the country to allow police to use drones outfitted with deadly weapons, a proposal immediately met with concern by civil rights and liberties advocates.The bill would ban the use of weaponized drones, but exempt police. Details on how law enforcement could use drones with weapons would be spelled out in new rules to be developed by the state Police Officer Standards and Training Council. Officers also would have to receive training before being allowed to use drones with weapons.“Obviously this is for very limited circumstances,” said Republican state Sen. John Kissel, of Enfield, co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee that approved the measure Wednesday and sent it to the House of Representatives. “We can certainly envision some incident on some campus or someplace where someone is a rogue shooter or someone was kidnapped and you try to blow out a tire.”North Dakota is the only state that allows police to use weaponized drones, but limits the use to “less lethal” weapons, including stun guns, rubber bullets and tear gas.Read more








While the media is acting like Michael Flynn is preparing to blow the whistle on imaginary Russian interference in our election, his actual statement reads very differently.USA Today is the only outlet which accurately reported on this story under the headline: “Flynn lawyer: Client wants assurances against ‘witch-hunt’ prosecution.”WASHINGTON — The attorney representing President Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn said late Thursday that his client would not submit to questioning in the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election without protection against possible prosecution.“No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch-hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution,” attorney Robert Kelner said in a written statement.Describing his client as the target of “unsubstantiated public demands by members of congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated,” Kelner confirmed that there have been “discussions” regarding Flynn’s possible appearances before the House and Senate Intelligence committees now conducting formal inquires into Russia’s attempts to disrupt the American political system.“Gen. Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” Kelner said. “Out of respect for the committees, we will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for Gen. Flynn and the . . . committees.”Here’s the full statement sent to The Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross:Statement from Flynn's lawyer acknowledging discussions w/ House and Senate Intel Committees, no mention of FBI. pic.twitter.com/4YH1VuLjAR— Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) March 30, 2017Statement from Flynn's lawyer acknowledging discussions w/ House and Senate Intel Committees, no mention of FBI. pic.twitter.com/4YH1VuLjAR— Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) March 30, 2017 The implication is clearly that we’re in a “witch-hunt environment” and he wants immunity as an assurance “against unfair prosecution.”









Tucker Carlson criticized Drexel professor George Ciccariello-Maher Wednesday night on Fox, saying he “writes like a child” and is incapable of forming “a clear sentence.”Ciccariello-Maher, who said last year he wants “white genocide” “for Christmas” and the “massacre” of whites during the Haitian revolution “was a good thing indeed,” told Tucker he opposes Charles Murray being allowed to speak at American universities because he’s “racist” and the SPLC labeled him a “white nationalist.”Tucker countered by questioning Ciccariello-Maher’s own credentials, saying he spent time reading many of his writings and found them incoherent.Tucker quoted from an article Ciccariello-Maher’s wrote in 2007 titled, “Dual Power in the Venezuelan Revolution“:“By viewing the process through the Leninist concept of ‘dual power’—that is, the construction of an autonomous, alternative power capable of challenging the existing state structure—we can see that the establishment of communal councils in Venezuela is clearly a positive step toward the development of fuller and deeper democracy, which is encouraging in and of itself. ““Now, that’s a sentence with too many adjectives, passive construction, imprecise language, it’s high school writing — it’s crap,” Tucker said.“You’re not an impressive scholar, that’s what I’m saying. You’re a performance artist!” Tucker said. “Your writing is childlike!”Tucker asked Ciccariello-Maher to explain the meaning of the passage he quoted, to which Ciccariello-Maher responded: “I’ve done extensive studies on popular power in Venezuela, on the development of what are called ‘communal councils.’ I know them better than most and I know what it means to develop these participatory institutions of democracy in Venezuela.”He said he’s “glad to talk about them,” but instead pivoted to accusing Tucker of not understanding “basic English.”

Two White House officials provided Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, with intelligence reports showing that President Trump and his team were swept up in foreign surveillance by US spy agencies, claims the New York Times.“Several current American officials identified the White House officials as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel’s Office and formerly worked on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee,” the Times reported on Thursday. “A White House spokesperson declined to comment.”The Times said Nunes was asked to meet the officials in a secure location at the White House where people with security clearances could view classified reports.“The real issue, Mr. Nunes has said, was that he could figure out the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances.” the report added. “He said some Trump associates were also identified by name in the reports.”“Normally, intelligence agencies mask the identities of American citizens who are incidentally present in intercepted communications.”The Times likely got their information from moles leaking information from inside the White House which President Trump has described as a criminal act.And the mainstream media has been targeting Nunes ever since he pointed out there was “no evidence of collusion” between President Trump’s team and Russia on the night of the presidential election, which of course went against the establishment narrative of “Russian election meddling” being used to undermine Trump’s presidency.“Nunes’ acknowledgement of the lack of any proof appears believable, as the intelligence community did not even produce a solid piece evidence of the ‘hacking’ itself let alone the vague ‘Russian involvement,'” said former MI5 intelligence officer Anny Machon.Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealKitDanielsTwitter: Follow @KitDaniels1776 MORE Videos: Resistance News

The portion of the federal debt that is subject to a legal limit set by Congress plummeted by $56,758,000,000 on March 15 hitting its lowest level of 2017, according to the Daily Treasury Statement.On that same day, the federal debt hit its legal limit, according to the same Daily Treasury Statements.For the 15 days since then, according to the Treasury’s statements, the debt subject to the limit has been frozen at $19,808,747,000,000—approximately $25 million below the new legal limit.The debt was able to hit its legal limit—even on a day when it was plunging dramatically–because when the Republican Congress and President Barack Obama on Nov. 2, 2015 enacted the most recent legislation lifting the legal limit on the debt they did not actually set a new limit. Instead, they suspended the debt limit, which allowed the federal government to borrow money and run up new debt without any limit at all throughout the election year of 2016.Read more








Federal debt held by the public is set to hit 77 percent of gross domestic product by the end of this year, the highest level seen since shortly after World War II, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s 2017 long-term budget outlook.Federal debt held by the public, defined as the amount that the federal government borrows from financial markets, has ballooned over the last decade. In 2007, the year the recession began, debt held by the public represented 35 percent of GDP. Just five years later, federal debt held by the public has doubled to 70 percent and is projected to continue rising.Debt has not seen a surge this large since the increase in federal spending during World War II, when debt exceeded 70 percent of GDP. The budget office projects that growing budget deficits will cause the debt to increase sharply over the next three decades, hitting 150 percent of GDP by 2047.Deficits are projected to rise over the next few years because government spending is outpacing tax revenue, causing a substantial imbalance in the federal budget. In 2017, the deficit was 2.9 percent of GDP. This is projected to rise to 9.8 percent in 2047.Read more

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has demanded China do more to rein in an increasingly aggressive North Korea.North Korea is believed to be preparing for a sixth nuclear test. This test will potentially be different from previous tests and may have a higher explosive yield. Nikki Haley warned Thursday that America’s patience on this particular issue is wearing thin.“I have no patience for it, and it is not helping anyone. This administration has no patience for it,” she said. “Look, can we change the way North Korea thinks? No. They’re not going to cave. China can, and that’s the part we want to look at.”“I know China says they’re worried about North Korea. I know China wants to see North Korea stop with the testing. Prove it. Prove it,” she said.President Donald Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week in Mar-a-Lago, where the two leaders will address important issues affecting the bilateral relationship. Haley said that Trump will raise the issue of North Korea during the meeting.“I think you’re going to see them talk very much about the responsibility that we believe China has,” she said. “The fact that we don’t have the patience to sit here and see it go round and round any more. And the fact that we want action.”She alleged that China is still importing North Korean coal despite China’s claims in February to have suspended all coal shipments. Coal is a primary source of revenue for the reclusive regime.Haley said that if North Korea makes another provocative move in violation of U.N. resolutions, she expects to see a response from key players like China and Russia.“If something happens, if this continues down the path that we’re going on, I can tell you we’re not just going to sit down and say ‘Oh, they did it again,’” she said. “This is something that is very serious. This is something the administration is making a priority. And this is something we absolutely expect China and Russia to respond to.”Haley’s comments reflected those of Trump, who has repeatedly criticized China for not doing its part to prevent its neighbor and treaty ally from launching missiles and testing nuclear weapons.“It’s a very dangerous situation, and China can end it very quickly in my opinion,” Trump commented in February. “I think China has tremendous control over North Korea, whether they say so or not. They could solve the problem very easily if they want to.” China has been largely unresponsive, often pushing the burden back on the U.S.Beijing asserts that it has faithfully fulfilled its obligations as a responsible state actor and member of the U.N. Security Council, and claims that the “cause and crux” of the crisis on the peninsula is America’s hard-line policies.









In the heart of tax season, Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen will address the National Press Club next Wednesday even as many members of Congress question why someone who dodged impeachment during the Obama administration continues to be the face of the tax collecting agency under President Donald Trump.“It could be partly that for the checklist of the Trump administration, they don’t yet have a full Cabinet and this isn’t a priority. External pressure, from what I picked up, should continue,” Jordan Sekulow, executive director for the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative legal group, told The Daily Signal. “If we saw more pressure from Congress, I think Koskinen would be gone.”Koskinen’s five-year term ends in November, unless he is removed. Though Koskinen wasn’t in office when the IRS targeted tea party and conservative groups, House Republicans said he was repeatedly uncooperative and misled congressional investigators. Koskinen has said he acted in good faith to cooperate with the investigation.Read more








Defense Secretary James Mattis on Friday hinted at Russian interference in the U.S. election and said a decision will come soon on how to respond to the country’s alleged violations of a nuclear arms control agreement.“Russia’s violations of international law are now a matter of record,” Mattis said at a press conference in London, “from what happened with Crimea to other aspects of their behavior in mucking around other people’s elections and that sort of thing.”Mattis was responding to a reporter who asked whether it was time for the United States to exit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty banning nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.The U.S. has accused Russia of developing and fielding such a weapon. Russia denies it has violated the treaty.Read more
