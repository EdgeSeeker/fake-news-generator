“TSA allows for a pat-down of a teenage passenger, and in this case, all approved procedures were followed to resolve an alarm of the passenger’s laptop,” spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said in an email.Huh? Was the laptop given a full groping too? Why would they need to do this if the teen set off no alarms but a computer did?For at least two minutes, the TSA officer at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport gives the boy a going-over that just seems a little too thorough.Read more: WaPoTSA SEXUALLY MOLESTS TEEN AT LAGUARDIA:
This is so scary for anyone out there but especially for parents who fly their kids to different places alone. This TSA agent took advantage of this young girl who was probably scared to death. Horrible!A college student was sexually molested at LaGuardia Airport by a uniformed TSA agent who demanded she go into a bathroom with him after she got off a flight so she could be searched, sources told The Post.The 22-year-old victim, who is Korean, had gotten off the plane from Salt Lake City around 8 p.m. Tuesday when the agent approached her on the third floor of Terminal B.
He “lured” her into the bathroom by demanding she be searched and then molested her, the sources said.
The woman filed a complaint with cops, and witnesses at a money exchange booth were able to help identify the sex fiend.
The alleged assailant — a 5-foot-9, heavyset man wearing a TSA uniform — has been arrested and charged with sexual abuse, the sources said. The student picked the suspect out of a photo lineup.
His identity was not immediately released.
A spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration was not immediately able to provide any information about the arrest.

United States Marine Field McConnell 

Plum City Online - (AbelDanger.net) 

March 19, 2017


Abel Danger (AD) has explained how AD's Global Operations Director Field McConnell can show President Trump how Serco tracked 8(a) company pedophiles with Demon face-recognition software and injected fake news of the JonBenét Ramsey murder using a bogus ransom note on the federal bridge*.



*The Federal Bridge Certification Authority – A communication network allegedly set up by Serco to synchronize fake-news injects with sabotage, murder, assassination and propaganda missions sponsored by a deep-state community of Senior Executive Service bureaucrats and US/UK pedophile newsgroups. 


McConnell claims that Serco and his sister Kristine Marcy – ICE Foundation director and Con Air founder – began using the DoJ Joint Automated Booking System, built by Nortel Networks, in 1996 to place pedophiles and 8(a) company agents and mentors at Demon crimes scenes and publish fake news of murder for hire on the federal bridge.


McConnell claims that Serco and Marcy staged the JonBenét murder in December 1996 to extort control over selected users of the federal bridge including John Ramsey's Access Graphics, Lockheed Martin director Lynne Cheney and their networks of 8(a) Small Business Technology Companies ('S.B.T.C').


AD claims that Serco – preferred C4I supplier to Boeing – used Demon software and a BBC/ICE archive of child pornography assembled by Jimmy Savile (d. 2011) to blackmail Boeing and Lockheed directors into moving Boeing's HQ to Chicago and mentoring 8(a) attacks over the federal bridge on 9/11.


AD claims that Serco provided the UK Cabinet Office with deep state training for 9/11 when BBC pedophile elites allegedly injected fake news into media plays while 8(a) company actors, experienced journalists and television crews produced the "first live broadcast mass snuff film in human history."


AD claims that Serco and Marcy agents organized the late Clement Freud and Tony and John Podesta into a pedophile news group on the federal bridge and tracked their virtual identities with Demon face recognition software through the crime scenes associated with the abduction of Madeleine McCann on 3 May 2007 from her bed in a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal.


Field McConnell is asking for a meeting with President Trump to explain how, with a 14-word amendment (see below) to the U.S. criminal code, he can stop McConnell's sister Marcy's and Serco's alleged use of face-recognition software on interstate commerce facilities including the federal bridge to extort fake news injects from suspects' – not exclusively pedophiles' – and conceal murder for hire..


"18 U.S. Code § 1958 Use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire where "Whoever travels … with intent that a murder be committed [or news or evidence of such a murder be concealed, withheld, destroyed or faked] … and if death results, shall be punished by death or life imprisonment, or shall be fined not more than $250,000, or both."

"John Ramsey and Lockheed Martin 
Posted in the JonBenet Ramsey Forum
 #5 Feb 26, 2012 
There is a bit about this matter of Lockheed Martin on the Miss Marple website.


I still think it's odd that Lockheed Martin did no investigating at all in the Ramsey case. Then they later made subsequent anti-Ramsey statements about the case, even on TV.


It's almost as if Lockheed Martin know exactly what happened in relation to the JonBenet murder and that they want to cover it up and blame the innocent Ramseys for it.


Don't you think that if the daughter of a senior executive is murdered then Lockheed Martin might be a little curious about it all? I suppose whistleblowing about it is supposed to be unethical and morally wrong, and the media is not much help.


From the Miss Marple website:


"Federal Law Enforcement Cover-up


Evidence for a Federal Law Enforcement Cover-up


FBI Did Not Act. Internet poster Henrietta McPhee (see post #13) has posted the following. It is provided here verbatim because of its explosive implications.


"Donald Freed has an interesting theory about Lockheed Martin and the Ramsey case. He is a visiting professor at Loyola Marymount University (L.A.) and teaches at U.S.C. This is part, and an edited version by me, of what he has said about the matter:


1."So the two units, in the Boulder Area, are trained to react to an act of terrorism, like kidnapping, are Lockheed Martin Security on one hand and the FBI on the other. Now, NOBODY FROM EITHER TWO OF THESE UNITS CAME NEAR THAT CRIME SCENE and the question is as in the case of Sherlock Holmes' dog that didn't bark. What you're looking at here is SOMETHING THAT IS SO IRREGULAR; SO IMPOSSIBLE, because remember, the SOG, the seat of government operates in this regard."


2."The FBI's entire profile is based on quick, rapid, decisive action. They take over public 
relations."


3."They'd have the Boulder police direct traffic at the periphery. No one gets in or out of that house. No one touches the crime scene. Every home in that area of Boulder is secured. In the case of Adobe Graphics three years before, there was an executive kidnapped and hundred's of FBI agents poured into the landscape. When in Michigan where another industrial kidnapping tool place---where a wife was suspected actually-- hundreds of FBI agents poured in."


4."What I'm telling you now is a composite of my interviews with FBI executives in this country and elsewhere---former agents and Lockheed Martin agents. When a note announces "terrorism" it is the magic word in the United States for both law enforcement and budgetary considerations. They had to know, not only were there no foreign terrorists, but they had to know BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT that what happened neither affected the security of the United States of America or the security and profits of Lockheed Martin."


5."That this, though located inside a home, may have repercussions outside in terms of circles of people who would not want investigations going on about child pornography, child abuse, or child sexuality. I've summed up for you what a year of research has led me to.""

ATTORNEY GENERAL PRESENTS HAMMER AWARDS 
AT DOJ "LAB DAY"


WASHINGTON, DC -- Attorney General Janet Reno presented Hammer Awards to three employee working groups from Justice Department components as part of the Department's "Justice Performance Review Lab Day," an event showcasing the achievements of the Department's 16 reinvention labs. 


The Hammer Award is Vice President Gore's special recognition to teams of employees which made significant contributions in support of the President's National Performance Review (NPR) principles of improving customer service, cutting red tape, empowering employees, and getting back to basics. 


"By accepting the challenge to re-invent government, these employees are making government more efficient and improving the way we perform our public responsibilities," Reno said during theLab Day event in the Justice Department's Great Hall. Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, who also attended, noted that the employees "have taken the concept of creating a government that works better and costs less and have made it a reality." 


The three Justice Department teams receiving the award are: 


• The SENTRI Reinvention Lab, for developing a secure, high-tech, automated border inspection system at Otay Mesa, California; 


• The Joint Automated Booking System (JABS) Lab, a multi-component effort which has significantly improved the prisoner booking process; 


• The Justice Prisoner Alien Transportation System (JPATS), which combines the resources of several DOJ components to schedule [murder for hire] and transport prisoners more quickly, safely, and economically. Additional information on the awardees is attached. 96-523 ###"

Global swoop on newsgroup paedophiles 
By Will Knight 
More than 130 people in 19 different countries have been arrested or are under investigation after police traced the distribution of child pornography through different internet newsgroups. 


Technical experts at UK internet service provider Demon Internet aided officers from the National Crime Squad's new Hi-Tech Crime Unit with the investigation. 


A spokesperson from Thus, Demon's parent company, says that investigators were not given access to the server logs that record Demon users' activities. 


Investigators were simply provided with access to newsgroup postings in the same way as any other Demon customer. Technical experts from Demon then helped officers distinguish the identifying information contained within the message "headers" of particular postings. 


Face recognition 


Officers traced postings relating to certain images to different internet service providers around the world and then contacted Interpol to track down suspects. 


Investigators say they discovered 10,000 suspect postings to over 30 different newsgroups and identified 60,000 new images. They plan to use face recognition software to identify victims in different images, to help trace them. This software has been developed in conjunction with UK company Serco, although no technical details have been released".

"Serco farewell to NPL after 19 years of innovation 
Published: 8 Jan 2015
 
Serco said goodbye to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at the end of December 2014 after 19 years of extraordinary innovation and science that has seen the establishment build a world-leading reputation and deliver billions of pounds of benefit for the UK economy. During that period under Serco's management and leadership, NPL has delivered an extraordinary variety and breadth of accomplishments for the UK's economy and industry.  Some of the key achievements during that time have been: -


The beneficial impact of NPL's work to the economy is estimated at £2Bn pa.

In 2012, NPL's role in building the first maser to operate at room temperature was nominated by Physics World as one of the top ten breakthroughs of the year (CERN topped the list for their discovery of a Higgs-like particle).

NPL was instrumental in gaining a 50% increase in European funding for the EMPIR programme, with a total of EUR 600m.

It has been estimated that work carried out by the Centre of Carbon Measurement at NPL will save eight million tonnes of carbon emissions reductions (2% of UK footprint) and over half a billion pounds in economic benefit over the next decade.

Annually over 145,000 people undergoing radiotherapy have relied upon NPL for accurate delivery; it has been estimated that NPL's contribution to improving the accuracy of the radiation dose patients receive can save at least an additional 145 lives each year.

NPL's work on graphene - the new material that could revolutionise the future of high-speed electronics - has been widely acknowledged following a paper in Nature Nanotechnology and then was cited as one of 44 papers as part of 2010's Nobel Prize in Physics.

NPL achieved 11% per annum growth in third-party business since 2004; such work now accounts for over 40% of the lab's revenue, with £52M orders achieved in 2014.

Under Serco's management, Alan Turnbull was the first NPL scientist in many years to be elected as a Fellow of The Royal Society; Professor John Pethica, NPL's Chief Scientist was knighted, Seton Bennett was awarded a CBE, Kamal Hossain an OBE, and Patrick Gill and Michael de Podesta were awarded MBEs.

NPL's caesium fountain atomic clock is accurate to 1 second in 158 million years and NPL is playing a key role in introducing rigour to high frequency trading [and front running frauds] in the City through NPLTime.

"'Angel is next': The terrifying message pilot of Air Force One got as he flew President Bush on 9/11 
 Air traffic controllers warned another jet was approaching and not responding to calls
Pilot flew the Boeing 747 out into the Gulf of Mexico but the other plane did not follow 
By Paul Thompson for MailOnline 
UPDATED: 12:43 GMT, 7 September 2011 
The pilot of Air Force One has revealed for the first time how they feared the presidential jet would be rammed by hijacked jet in the hours after the 9/11 terror attack.

Colonel Mark Tillman said he and his crew received a radio message saying 'Angel is next' as America reeled from the attack on the twin towers.
Angel was the secret call sign for Air Force One as it left Sarasota, Florida, where President Bush had been told about the attacks on the Twin Towers.

'And at that time it kind of led us to believe maybe someone was coming into us in Sarasota, they saw us take off, they just stayed high and are following us at this point.

'We had no idea what the capabilities of the terrorist were at that point.'

Tillman said he flew the specially adapted Boeing 747 out into the Gulf of Mexico to see if the other plane would follow.

When the other jet continued on its route he was later told it was an airliner that had lost its transponder -which sends out an electronic identification signal - and the pilots had failed to switch to a new radio frequency.

Tillman said the threat remained and he received the message: 'We got word from the vice president and the staff that 'Angel was next,' Angel being the classified call sign of Air Force One.'

'Once we got into the Gulf and they passed to us that 'Angel was next,' at that point I asked for fighter support. If an airliner was part of the attack, it would be good to have fighters on the wing to go ahead and take care of us.'

The senior pilot said President Bush's plans to fly to Washington DC were scrapped and he landed at air force bases in Louisiana and Nebraska from where the president addressed the nation.

Tillman said he was fearful Air Force One would be attacked when he brought the plane back to Andrews Air Force base in Washington DC.
'All along, everybody knew I was bringing him home, so my fear was they've done all of this, they know Air Force One is eventually going to come back to Washington, D.C.; they are sitting there, they're waiting for us,' he said.

Tillman, who now flies a corporate jet after retiring from his duties with Air Force One in 2009, said he fears terrorists will launch another attack.

He told Fox News:'I'm a strong believer that there will be other attacks.


'They caught us with our pants down, they attacked our country, they attacked from within... You got to assume right now that they're going to go ahead and infiltrate us and they're going to go ahead, take advantage of everything we offer to them.'


He added: 'I think President Bush did a great job making sure the American people realize our safety is important, but we've got to go ahead and protect each and every one of us, take care of each other and change the way we do business so the terrorists won't take advantage of us anymore.'"

SERCO – The Biggest Company You've Never Heard Of
From Australian television [2:49]
If one single company had to be chosen as the exemplar of the military/industrial complex, esnl's pick would be Serco, a British company created in 1929 as a local branch of Radio Corporation of America.


Today the firm runs air traffic control towers in the U.S., immigration detention centers in Australia, schools and the anti-missile defense system in Britain, and much, much more.


Of special interest to us is the company's growing role in the espionage world and intelligence world, especially here in the U.S., where it is based in Reston, Virginia, the nation’s capital of corporate spookery.


According to Crocodyl, the company holds contracts with an alphabet soup of three- and four-letter agencies, including the National Security Agency [NSA], National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency [NGA], the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Office of Naval Intelligence, the Air Force Information Warfare Center, and the Department of Defense.


Here's an example of the folks who work for Serco, from a new hire announcement posted by the company two years ago:
Serco Inc., a provider of professional, technology, and management services to the federal government, ­announced today that Maureen Baginski has been named Vice President of the intelligence business and National Security Advisor at Serco. … From 2003 to 2005, Ms. Baginski served as the FBI's Executive Assistant Director for Intelligence where she was responsible for establishing and managing the FBI's first-ever intelligence program. Her mission was to adapt FBI intelligence capabilities with information technologies to create an intelligence-sharing operation that could identify threats before they became attacks.


From 1979 to 2003, Ms. Baginski served at the National Security Agency (NSA), where she held a variety of positions, including Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Director, Senior Operations Officer in the National Security Operations Center; Executive Assistant to the Director of NSA/Central Security Service, Chief Officer of the Director; Assistant Deputy Director of Technology and Systems; and lead analyst for the Soviet Union. As SIGINT Director, Ms. Baginski successfully established and directed a unified program to exploit encrypted or denied information on global networks. Leading the NSA's Signals Intelligence Directorate, the Nation's high technology cryptology organization, she managed a complex and geographically dispersed distributed information production enterprise.


The company's CEO is an India-born Pentecostal Christian [shades of Dinesh D'Souza], and is profiled here by The Guardian's Janice Martinson in 2006." 

"DHS ICE OTD … Since 1986, through various contracts, Serco has provided full training lifecycle support for all areas of this key Law Enforcement organization including Inspections, Border Patrol, Enforcement, and DHS operations at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Academy in Glynco, GA. .. Serco developed and scripted three scenarios based on negligent practices identified by the IG report that have resulted in the use of lost or uncontrolled weapons for robbery, murder, and the accidental death of a child. We used creative animation techniques, sound effects, music, and talented voice actors playing multiple characters to create an emotional appeal much different—and infinitely more powerful—from the standard WBT offering.  

Serco has trained more than 400,000 DHS students in every region and district, at every land, air and sea border crossing, in classrooms, through WBT, train-the-trainer programs, on-the-job training and through the implementation of performance support systems in a blended learning environment. In collaboration with ICE OTD, our latest efforts have resulted in the accreditation and completion of three programs, including HSI FOTP, ICE OTD IDC, and ICE OPR. Serco was integral to the ICE team that was recognized by the 2012 "Excellence in Law Enforcement" Award given to the ICE Domestic Field Operations Training Program (DFTOP) Accreditation Project for having greatly improved ICE training, increasing operational efficacy and efficiency, and minimizing safety issues to ICE officers and the public."

They are an ideal way of developing solutions, procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making. Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line, either in real-time or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas. The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations. 


Command/Control Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping. Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems. This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support. The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit, or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan. Such exercises also test information flow, communications, equipment, procedures, decision making and coordination. 


Simulation and Media Support The method of delivering an exercise is flexible and will be designed with the client to meet their requirements with options ranging from simple paper-based delivery through to full use of their real communications systems [Red Switch Network and Hawkeye onion router surveillance aircraft] and advance computer simulation [In Trump's death pool and war room suites].

It was just this morning that Donald Trump once again tried to ignore his mounting failures and pump up his ego by trashing the press. Taking to Twitter, the undeserving POTUS bashed the New York Times (again) with yet another one of his lies. And after Trump trashed the New York Times, he posted another tweet about the “vicious” and inaccurate media:If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2017However, thanks to a new poll released by Monmouth University, Trump’s temper tantrums about the press are far from over, because he seems to be alone in his opinion. The Monmouth University poll revealed that thanks to Trump’s numerous lies and falsehoods, Americans now view MSNBC as a more credible source than him!You can only imagine how devastating it is for Trump to realize that his attacks on “fake news” are actually working against him and HELPING networks that dare to publish the truth about him. The poll stated:“Only 28% of Americans are more likely trust Trump as an information source compared to ABC news while most (53%) say they would tend to trust ABC more, with 15% saying they would trust both sides equally. When pitted against MSNBC, 33% trust Trump more while 47% trust the liberal leaning cable channel more, with 15% trusting both about equally. When pitted against Fox News, only 17% trust Trump more while 37% trust the politically conservative news outlet more, with 36% trusting both about equally.”Another interesting but not surprising finding from the poll was the fact that networks like MSNBC and ABC were viewed as more credible than Fox News, which has previously been outed as the most dishonest network (which is likely why Trump cites them so much). The only area where Trump is actually succeeding in credibility is among Republicans, who tend to take Trump’s nonsense as the truth. The poll reported:“The story is different, though, when isolating the views of Republicans. Americans who identify as GOP partisans are more likely to have confidence in Trump over any of the news sources tested in the poll. This is especially true for MSNBC – Trump is more trusted by a 66% to 16% margin – and ABC News – Trump is more trusted by a 56% to 22% margin. The president even has a slight, although statistically insignificant, 29% to 26% trust advantage over Fox News among his fellow partisans, with 44% of Republicans saying they trust both equally as an information source.”So, Trump basically screwed himself over by trying to damage the credibility of the free press. While it’s somewhat satisfying to see his attacks on the media backfire, we must not forget that what Trump’s ridiculous behavior has resulted in is extremely dangerous. The White House now has no credibility, which could be devastating in the event that something serious happens. No one can trust the president, and he has undermined the credibility of the government. It will take a long time to repair this and rebuild the trust of the American people.Featured image is a screenshot









A 31-year-old man in Virginia was arrested and charged with wearing a mask in public Friday after he was spotted walking around dressed as the iconic comic book supervillain the Joker, police said.

Police in Winchester -- located about 75 miles northwest of Washington, D.C. -- said the Winchester Emergency Communications Center received "several calls" around 2 p.m. on Friday of a suspicious male wearing a black cape and carrying a sword walking around the city.

Jeremy Putman was charged with wearing a mask in public, a felony that could land him in jail for up to five years, the Winchester Police Department said in a statement.

Police said they had received several similar reports over the last week, but they do not believe there are additional suspects.



Although it may seem surprising that wearing a mask in public is a felony, police said it wants "to remind the community of the seriousness of the crime."

According to Virginia Code 18.2-422, "It shall be unlawful for any person over 16 years of age, with the intent to conceal his identity, wear any mask, hood, or other device, whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden or covered, so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, to be or appear in any public place, or upon any private property in this Commonwealth, without first having obtained from the owner or tenant thereof consent to do so in writing."

Putnam is being held at the Northwestern Regional Adult Detention Center on a $2,000 secured bond.

It is unclear if he has an attorney.








Remember a few weeks ago when Trump asked for the resignation of US Attorneys? Democrats and the media acted like it was the end of the world even though Obama and Bill Clinton did the exact same thing.Now the Democratic National Committee has asked for the resignation of their entire staff. It looks like the new chairman Tom Perez is cleaning house.Will Democrats and the media go nuts over this? Not likely.NBC News reported:Embattled DNC Asks All Staffers For Resignation LettersDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has launched a major overhaul of the party’s organization, which has been stung by recent crises — and the DNC has requested resignation letters from all current staffers.Party staff routinely see major turnover with a new boss and they had been alerted to expect such a move. However, the mass resignation letters will give Perez a chance to completely remake the DNC’s headquarters from scratch. Staffing had already reached unusual lows following a round of post-election layoffs in December.Immediately after Perez’s selection as party chairman in late February, an adviser to outgoing DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile, Leah Daughtry, asked every employee to submit a letter of resignation dated April 15, according to multiple sources familiar with the party’s internal workings.Watch the DNC replace all these staffers with far left social justice warrior types.They have learned nothing from the election.

Another Republican was just caught red-handed meeting with Obama and his Deep State shadow government.The group, which operates in secret with a very public agenda of bringing down the Republican-led government, has already been credited with killing the greatest health care bill of all time, the ACHA, by recruiting people like Speaker Paul Ryan and causing a rift between rank and file GOP regulars and the Freedom Caucus.The latest defector, which comes as a HUGE surprise, is Rep Darrell Issa (R-California). Issa is well known as the leader of the congressional committees that investigated Hillary Clinton until Trey Gowdy took over in 2015.He was seen entering a restaurant shortly after Obama arrived with Senator Chuck Schumer, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and none other than Hillary Clinton. Paul Ryan wasn’t spotted but was also unaccounted for at his office on Capitol Hill.All in all, Trump operatives currently doing recon on Obama counted 17 high-ranking members or former members of government, all of whom are known socialists.Issa, who is considered by many to be a staunch conservative, is also the wealthiest member of congress with the most to gain from the fall of the GOP.Trey Gowdy wasn’t available for comment, but his assistant, Mandy Gonsales, told Fox News that he has always been leery of Issa and that now we know why his committees never got to the bottom of anything. President Trump has summoned Issa to the White House. We’ll keep you updated.

A mysterious video posted on YouTube claims there is a super massive wall located beneath Earth’s oceans, encompassing the entire planet. This mysterious wall, found by a YouTube channel called ‘Flat Earth Arabic’ claims the massive wall tens of thousands of miles across beneath the ocean.In the distant past, UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists have found countless unexplained things on Google Earth. From pyramids to mysterious towers, petroglyphs, and even sunken cities, Google Earth has unleashed the imagination of people around the globe.Not long ago we reported about a supposed discovered just off the coast of Mexico—12°8’1.5″N, 119°35’26.4″W—where a researcher discovered a  humongous underwater pyramid. Among the many structures that are said to remain hidden beneath the ocean, ‘researchers’ have found things that—supposedly—challenge everything we know about our history.Last year, a teenager using Google Earth ‘discovered’ what researchers are calling one of the largest, previously unknown ancient cities belonging to the Maya.In similar ways, researchers all around the globe have been hunting for Pyramids and lost structures that have eluded experts for decades.In 2012, American researcher Angela Micol discovered ‘Pyramids larger than those found on the Giza Plateau, using satellite images.But countless different discoveries have been made using Google Earth.Last year we reported about a complex of structures that stretch for a staggering 76 miles at its furthest points.The formations found off the coast of Baja California include mysterious tube-like constructions that are roughly 2.4 miles in width. Given the curious shape and distinguishable lines, many believe these are just some of the many underwater structures on our planet.However, these new claims go beyond anything we’ve probably ever come across.This wall’s sheer size and its adherence to linearity indicate it is not a natural formation to many. In fact, many people are convinced that due to the numerous discoveries made across the globe which completely contradict history as we have been taught in school, something like this is entirely possible. After all—they say—Earth is millions of years old and we are begging to uncover evidence that suggests many ancient civilizations inhabited Earth in our planet’s long history.Zooming in on the provided coordinates you clearly see what seems to be a MASSIVE structure. But who could have erected such a wall? If it really is an artificial structure, how old is it? What was its purpose?Many disagree and don’t believe we are looking at an actual wall. In fact, there even might be a perfectly reasonable explanation for the enigmatic finding.What if we are looking at a Google Earth glitch?Due to the fact that Google Earth uses different images while ‘mapping the planet’, it isn’t uncommon to encounter parts of the map that just didn’t quite match perfectly, resulting in a MASSIVE wall that encompasses the entire planet.One of the most likely explanations for this ‘impressive find’ is that we are looking at a digital seem in the mapping of the Poles.Image stitching or photo stitching is the process of combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama or high-resolution image.Commonly performed through the use of computer software, most approaches to image stitching require nearly exact overlaps between images and identical exposures to produce seamless results.Image stitching is widely used in today’s world and was used in the satellite images we are seeing on Google Earth.A lot of things can have played a role in creating such an effect. Illumination, point of view, reference, and many other things may have played a crucial role in this massive error. One of the most likely reasons for the seam appearing could be the background changing between two images for the same continuous foreground.Check out the video:What are your thoughts? What are we looking at there? A Supermassive wall as the above video claims? Or just another glitch in the image processing techniques in Google maps?Featured image by Julian-Faylona








By: Kalee Brown via collective-evolution.comAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 11% of American children between the ages of 4 and 17 have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as of 2011. However, if you ask the American Psychiatric Association (APA), they maintain that even though only 5% of American children suffer from the disorder, the diagnosis is actually given to around 15% of American children. This number has been steadily rising, jumping from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2007.Big Pharma has played a significant role in manufacturing the ADHD epidemic in the U.S., convincing parents and doctors that ADHD is a common problem amongst children and one that should be medicated. However, many countries disagree with the American stance on ADHD, so much so that they have entirely different structures for defining, diagnosing, and treating it. For example, the percentage of children in France that have been diagnosed and medicated for ADHD is less than 0.5%. This is largely because French doctors don’t consider ADHD a biological disorder with biological causes, but rather a medical condition caused by psycho-social and situational factors.French child psychiatrists use a different system than American psychiatrists to classify emotional problems in childhood. Instead of using the APA’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the French use an alternative classification system produced by the French Federation of Psychiatry called Classification Française des Troubles Mentaux de L’Enfant et de L’Adolescent (CFTMEA). Not only does this significantly differ from the APA’s system, but it was actually created with the intention to “offer French child psychiatrists an alternative to DSM-III” because it didn’t complement French psychiatric practices. The CFTMEA encourages psychiatrists to identify the underlying issues that cause a child’s symptoms and to address them using a psychopathological approach.France defines ADHD as a sociological disorder that’s caused by a set of social situations, whereas the U.S. sees ADHD as a neurological disorder whose symptoms are the result of biological disfunction or a chemical imbalance in the brain. France’s definition of ADHD drastically differs from that of the U.S., which is in part because the pharmaceutical industry helped define ADHD in the U.S. (you can read more about that here). France’s treatment methods, therefore, also greatly differ from those practiced in the U.S.Once a French psychiatrist diagnoses their patient with ADHD, they hone in on the behavioural problems by searching for the underlying causes. Psychiatrists will study the child’s distress and compare it to their social situations. France views ADHD as a social context problem; therefore, ADHD is often treated with psychotherapy or even family counselling. Very rarely do French psychiatrists prescribe medications to treat ADHD, as it’s usually rendered unnecessary after taking a more holistic approach.It’s important to note that French psychiatrists also consider a patient’s diet when searching for the causes of behavioural symptoms associated with ADHD. Poor eating habits such as consuming foods with artificial colours or flavourings, preservatives, sugars, and/or allergens may worsen a child’s behaviour. This isn’t difficult to imagine; even as adults we can feel the effects certain foods have on our mood, energy levels, and thought processes.A study conducted in 2011 stated that the amount of youth in France with ADHD may be as low as 3.5% — a far cry from the 11 to 15% estimate in the United States. Family therapist and author of A Disease Called Childhood: Why ADHD Became an American Epidemic Dr. Marilyn Wedge suggests that this may be as a result of the cultural differences between the U.S. and France in regards to raising children. According to Wedge, French parents will often impose more structured lifestyles onto their children, such as enforcing strict meal times and using the “cry it out” method with babies and toddlers. Children are taught self-discipline at a young age, which is why Wedge feels they don’t need to be medicated for behavioural issues.Unfortunately, spanking is not considered child abuse in France, so this practice is used fairly often to encourage discipline. In March 2015, the Council of Europe, an international human rights organization, faulted France over the country’s lack of legislation regarding corporal punishment of children. As The New York Times explained, “Child abuse is illegal in France and is punished with long prison sentences, but it is not uncommon for French parents to slap or spank children, or for the French courts to view such actions as acceptable under a customary ‘right to discipline.’ “As Dr. Wedge points out (although neither she nor Collective Evolution support spanking or any other form of child abuse), this simply adds to the discipline they’re encouraged to practice throughout their childhood (source).While Wedge makes some interesting points regarding discipline, I don’t think that’s the underlying reason why most French children don’t need to be medicated for ADHD. Rather, because ADHD is largely a behavioural issue, it rarely requires pharmacological intervention. I believe that these treatment methods are successful in France not because of their parenting culture, but rather as a result of their holistic approach in considering diet and behavioural and social context.I believe France does not have an issue with over-diagnosing ADHD in the same way the U.S. does because pharmaceutical companies have not targeted them as heavily. Pharmaceutical companies play a substantial role in defining ADHD and deciding treatment methods in the U.S. For example, doctors and researchers in the U.S. have been paid to overstate the dangers of ADHD and the benefits of taking their drugs and understate the negative side effects.It’s easy for people to believe this misguided information when it’s affiliated with well-known universities like Harvard and Johns Hopkins. Many people don’t even realize that these studies are funded by the very companies that profit from the drugs’ sale because that relationship is hidden in small print (source). These drugs can have significant side effects and are actually considered to be within the same class as morphine and oxycodone due to their high risk of abuse and addiction. You can’t just blame all doctors, either; many of them genuinely believe they’re helping these children because of the information they’ve been given in these studies and by Big Pharma.Another reason the U.S. has substantially higher rates of ADHD amongst children than France is because of the ADHD drug advertisements that run in the U.S. Big Pharma creates ads for ADHD drugs sold in the U.S. that are specifically targeted at parents, describing how these drugs can improve test scores and behaviour at home, among other false claims.One of the most controversial ones was a 2009 ad for Intuniv, Shire’s A.D.H.D. treatment, which included a child in a monster costume taking off his terrifying mask to reveal his calm, smiling self with a text reading, “There’s a great kid in there.” The FDA has stepped in multiple times, sending pharmaceutical companies warning letters or even forcing them to take down their ads because they are false, misleading, and/or exaggerate the effects of their drugs (source). This type of propaganda doesn’t take place in France, at least not on the same scale as the in U.S., largely because it doesn’t coincide with their ADHD diagnosis framework. You can read more about this topic in another article I wrote here.France’s CFTMEA, definition for ADHD, and holistic approach to treating this disorder provide an excellent example of how we should be addressing ADHD patients, especially children. Instead of getting to the root of these children’s “attention deficits” like French psychiatrists do, American health practitioners typically assume ADHD is a medical condition that can only be fixed with medication. This is not only unethical, but also clearly damaging to a child’s self esteem. Many of these kids could simply be uninterested in the subject matter, suffering from some sort of emotional trauma, or even have heightened creativity and energy! You can’t just blame all doctors in the U.S., either; many of them genuinely believe they’re helping these children because of the information they’ve been given in these studies and by Big Pharma.However, many scientists in the U.S. have suggested alternatives to medicine to treat ADHD and many of them don’t even recognize ADHD as a disorder (read our article on why ADHD may not be real here). Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine and Editor-in-Chief of The Carlat Psychiatry Report Daniel J. Carlat, M.D, criticized the DSM, stating, “In psychiatry, many diseases are treated equally well with medication or therapy, but the guidelines tend to be biased toward medication.”Holistic Mental Health Practitioner Dr. Tyler Woods further explains:The DSM tends to pathologize normal behaviors. For instance, the label “Anxiety Disorder” can be given as a result of some kinds of normal and rather healthy anxieties but the DSM will have experts view it and treat it as mental illness. In addition simple shyness can be seen and treated as “Social Phobia”, while spirited and strong willed children as “Oppositional Disorder”. Consequently, many psychotherapists, regardless of their theoretical orientations, tend to follow the DSM as instructed. (source)Neurologist Richard Saul spent his career examining patients who struggle with short attention spans and difficulty focusing. His extensive experience has led him to believe that ADHD isn’t actually a disorder, but rather an umbrella of symptoms that shouldn’t be considered a disease. Thus, Saul believes it shouldn’t be listed as a separate disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & Statistical Manual. You can read more about his opinion in our article here.Leading integrative pediatrician and author of ADHD without Drugs: A Guide to the Natural Care of Children with ADHD Dr. Sanford Newmark, M.D. has spent more than 15 years studying and successfully treating ADHD naturally. Some of his recommendations include improved nutrition, increased sleep, iron, zinc, and Omega-3 supplementation, family counselling, making positive social and behavioural changes, and pursing alternative modalities such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Homeopathy. Dr. Newmark considers conventional medication a “last resort,” given the fact that ADHD drugs only work about 70% of the time and have potential negative side effects (source).It is clear that many doctors are starting to recognize the importance of treating ADHD outside conventional methods. Misdiagnosis and over-diagnosis of ADHD is a serious issue in the U.S., one that is heavily fuelled by the pharmaceutical industry. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with ADHD, I strongly suggest you research this subject more and explore alternatives to medication with the help of a healthcare practitioner!“The very vocabulary of psychiatry is now defined at all levels by the pharmaceutical industry.” – Dr. Irwin Savodnik, Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California in Los Angeles (source)








By Brianna Acuesta at trueactivist.comIs Australia overstepping, or is this what’s needed to protect children?Many states in Australia already have laws nicknamed ‘No Jab, No Pay/Play’ in which children who are unvaccinated are not allowed to attend preschool or daycare centers, and parents receiving child benefit payments will not get checks if they don’t vaccinate their kids. However, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is pushing for an end to anti-vaxxing altogether by calling for national legislation that would cover all the states.It’s estimated that about 5% of children in Australia are unvaccinated, and PM Turnbull is looking to lessen this number even more. In his argument in favor of vaccinations, he pointed to a recent case where a baby died of whooping cough because the mother wasn’t aware of a whooping cough booster available to pregnant women. Her baby died when he was just one-month-old, and the vaccination for the infection isn’t available until 6 weeks of age.“This is not a theoretical exercise – this is life and death,” Turnbull said.“If a parent says, ‘I’m not going to vaccinate my child,’ they are not simply putting their child at risk, they are putting everybody else’s children at risk too.”It’s not illegal to be unvaccinated in Australia, but taking away benefits is one way the government is attempting to force parents to choose between vaccinating their children or giving up welfare checks/daycare privileges. When the first ‘No Jab, No Pay’ policy was enacted, it resulted in about 200,000 children being vaccinated, causing the government to take note and further the stakes.Many studies that ‘prove’ that autism and vaccinations are linked have been unfounded and disproven several times over, but the anti-vaxxing movement continues to grow as people fear that their children will suffer from the injections. Since it’s still not illegal to refuse to vaccinate children in the country, a parent still has the right to choose but their child will have less opportunities to interact with others because of the risk they pose.“If you, as a parent, expect the community to support you by either welfare payments or access to care, then you need to do your bit to contribute to that community by protecting other children,” Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon told Fairfax Media.Those that are against vaccines have pointed to ‘herd immunity’ as justification for not vaccinating their children. Herd immunity is when the people that are vaccinated prevent the spread of disease and therefore prevent those that aren’t vaccinated from ever becoming ill. However, as the number of people that are unvaccinated increases, the immunization of the ‘herd’ weakens, causing cracks and killing children with diseases that have not been a threat for decades.What are your thoughts on vaccinations? Please share, like, and comment on this article!This article (Australia Set To Make Vaccinations Mandatory For Children With New Law) is free and open source.

As presented at the “The Israel Lobby and American Policy” conference presented March 24, 2017 by the Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy.Public opinion polling is important, but little of it accurately measures what the American public thinks about key Israel/lobby issues. This survey series begins to fill in that information deficit.Focused, accurate polling should guide elected representatives, who can then act in the broader public interest. Polling about Israel lobby programs reveals a large gap between US government actions demanded by the lobby and policy outcomes the public prefers.The Israel lobby’s growth, size, composition and division of labor has become better understood since the disastrous US invasion of Iraq (which the lobby quietly supported) and the more recent battles over the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) signed by the Obama administration (which the lobby publicly, though unsuccessfully, opposed). This report uses the neologism “Israel/lobby” to express the oftentimes simultaneous public relations campaigns and lobbying programs pursued by the Israeli government in coordination with top advocacy organizations lobbying for Israel within the United States. Key US organizations include the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the American Jewish Committee (AJC), the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Hundreds more, including a small number of evangelical Christian organizations, play a role within a vast ecosystem that demands unconditional US support for Israel.In the year 2012 the nonprofit wing of the Israel lobby raised $3.7 billion in revenue. They are on track to reach $6.3 billion by 2020. Collectively they employed 14,000 and claimed 350,000 volunteers. However outside data suggests an estimated active membership of only about 774,000.This nonprofit foreign interest lobby, along with an overlapping political campaign contribution infrastructure not counted in the figures above, provides Israel with the US support among members of the Congress and other key influencers that purely American interests would not. This lobbying prowess goes on display as 15,000 AIPAC members gather at their annual policy conference every March, after which many visit their representatives on Capitol Hill to demand compliance with an increasingly costly legislative agenda.What Americans think about the methods by which this is achieved, the enormous costs and the outcomes is the subject of this report.Read the full report here.

CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACTTownsville man, Tyson Campbell (27) says he’s in a bit of a pickle this weekend, with his annual pilgrimage to Oxford street for the Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras clashing with the North Queensland Cowboys round 1 match against the Canberra Raiders.While initially hoping to be able to attend both the Mardi Gras and the football match on the same night, Tyson says he was distraught to find out that the Cowboys were playing Canberra at home.“Just my luck” he says.“Just about every second match they play is in Sydney”While Tyson says that he is a Cowboys fan first and a gay man second, he had already booked the flights to attend the iconic equality parade.“Had I known earlier I would I have given the Mardi Gras a miss. But my rig is looking pretty good and I booked these flights months before the draw came out”.“Hopefully there’s a pub playing the match in Oxford street. I’ve loaded up on JT as first try scorer”“Hopefully they won’t mind me bringing my 2 x 3 metres silk angel wings into the bar with me. But then again, I don’t give a shit if they care or not.

The national media desperately want to convince the American public that Hillary is unloved and unpopular. It is a pervasive and pernicious narrative that marginalizes the millions of people who like, admire and support her. The reality is very different from the media spin.Here’s the headline trumpeting a new ABC News/Washington Post survey: Poll: Clinton Unpopularity at New High, on Par With Trump.This is the traditional media’s favorite storyline: Hillary is hated. Her opponents repeat the point incessantly, hoping it will convince the world that she deserves to be shunned.Yet somehow she keeps winning. It vexes them.Let’s get behind the spin.That same ABC/WaPo poll that paints Hillary as an outcast contains inconvenient details for her detractors:Four out of five Democrats view Hillary favorably, as do four out of five Blacks. Her favorability is nearly 2-1 among non-whites overall.So the negative numbers are coming from Republicans and Independents who are inundated with Hillary hate day and night. It is an unfortunate fact of her candidacy and career that she is subjected to inordinate levels of negativity, unlike anything any other candidate has endured. That avalanche of invective is bound to suppress her favorability among certain segments of the public.There’s one more crucial detail missing from the unceasing narrative that Hillary is deeply unpopular — as promulgated in the ABC headline — namely, that she and Trump are viewed negatively for polar opposite reasons. He, because he is a bigot and bully; she, because she is furiously, continuously and unfairly maligned.Those are the facts.Peter Daou is a former adviser to Hillary Clinton, Arlen Specter, and John Kerry and a veteran of two presidential campaigns. 








WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—At a press conference on Tuesday morning, Ben Carson, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told reporters that people who are pushed out of windows are “extremely lucky” because they get “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fly through the air.”“Ever since the dawn of civilization, mankind has been enchanted by the dream of flight,” Carson said. “People who get pushed out of windows get to realize that cherished dream.”“That’s what makes America a great country,” he continued. “People are pushed out of windows every day here.”Carson said that, while he had never personally been pushed out of a window, “it’s on my bucket list.”On a subject more pertinent to his new job at HUD, Carson said that people without housing “enjoy the rare satisfaction you can only experience by building your own dwelling out of cardboard.”Andy Borowitz is the New York Times best-selling author of “The 50 Funniest American Writers,” and a comedian who has written for The New Yorker since 1998.

A commander in the Syrian rebel group Jabhat Fatah al-Sham has been killed by a US air strike that hit a meeting of the group’s leaders, rebels said.Abu Hajer al-Homsi was killed in a raid on Aleppo province, which was carried out by a US or NATO fighter jet, according to sources on the ground in Syria…








Imagine your local school loses $40,000 in funding because the kids throw the lunch away.Sounds terrible right? Who would throw food away? Who would want to lose $40,000 in lunch program reimbursements?No one, right?WRONG!When your school uses the Michelle Obama lunch program, then pretty much everyone throws the nasty food away. The food is barely edible, lowest quality garbage you can find. She wouldn’t let her kids eat this, so why is she trying to force her nasty food on everyone else?When you see the majority of students throw the food in the trash, directly from the cafeteria line, then it’s time to investigate and figure out a solution. How do you get the students to eat the food?The easiest solution was to stop serving them the equivalent of dog food. That’s what one school in PA did. They basically ditched the awful Michelle Obama free lunch program, opened a free market, and now their kids are eating like they’re supposed to.“You get to choose what you want instead of being sort of funneled in and only having one choice,” she noted. “I think everyone is happier with the new selection.”Obama’s lunch program is based on the belief that children lack the wisdom to make quality choices in the lunchroom. As such, they allegedly need cookie-cutter programs to direct their eating habits, regardless of their varying ages, sizes and genders.“(Y)ou can’t say that a 300-pound football player and a 90-pound cheerleader have the same (dietary) needs on a daily basis,” Lago remarked.This isn’t even the worst one I’ve seen!Before anyone thinks this is about feeding spoiled kids junk food and wants to comment about that- I challenge you to visit your local inner-city public schools and look at Michelle Obama’s food.It’s literally the most disgusting food that you will ever see.If you have kids in these schools, then have them take pictures of the food and post it in the comments for us.We would love to see her nasty food!

With fire departments seeing an increase in EMS based call volumes many are calling for the NFPA to address the needs of fire based EMS. One new mandate will see NFPA 1901 call for any new fire apparatus purchased by city’s with fire-medics have BLS capabilities. So called “Franken-rigs” for the Frankenstein’s Monster like mash up of both ambulance and fire engine, are already in service in some communities. As soon as the new mandate goes into effect many more will see these BLS engines rolling out to calls. Chief Fred Pozhar says the BLS engine should save his department money. “This will make for a great cost savings. Right now I need to have an engine, a ladder truck and an ambulance parked in my garage. I also have to staff a full crew for each vehicle. With all my firefighters certified as paramedics, now I only need to staff the engine and ladder. Fewer people per shift will save tax payers loads of money.”Union officials fear layoffs. The city says that based on anticipated retirements and promotions no one will be let go. The department will just hold off on hiring new staff. Firefighters question the safety of having a engine out of service to run medical calls. Many counter with statistics of fewer fire calls being run by many departments and increased use of sprinkler systems. According to Chief Pozhar he wishes both Engines and Trucks were forced to have the BLS compartments. “If I could also get a ladder on one of these ‘Franken-rigs’ it would majorly help. That would give me two full EMS crews out taking calls. It would also allow the milage for the vehicles to be split between vehicles.”Many cities are saying they will get rid of fire based EMS if they are forced to by a BLS engine. 








Ray J’s manager Cash Jones has just opened Pandora’s box this evening with his claim that famous upcoming rapper, Fetty Wap is not one-eyed at all, that the rapper has been deceiving the media by popping a fake eye that makes it seem like he has a bad eye.“Fetty Wap is a FAKE,” Cash Jones wrote on Instagram. “I knew I wasn’t tripping…One day it’s his left eye missing, the next day it’s his right eye. This n** looks to me like he popping in the fake missing eye.”Last Month, Fetty Wap narrated his growing up story after rumour made rounds that he was shot in the eye:“When I was little I had gotten into a little accident and it gave me congenital glaucoma in both of my eyes. The doctor saved one, I was blessed to still have my vision. That’s it. That’s the story. I never got shot in my eye, basically it was a prosthesis and the song was getting hotter, the pictures were getting viral, I just let it build up, it wasn’t nothing.”So, what do you think of this latest controversy?

Hillary Clinton and others like to say Donald Trump is “ISIS’ best recruiter” but who really created ISIS? George W. Bush and cronies when they destabilized the Middle East with the foolish war in Iraq. Remember, Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq War which makes her culpable in the creation of ISIS.As the phrase goes, “She’s one to talk.”Trump’s words in a 2004 Esquire magazine interview.Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we’re in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the county? C’mon. Two minutes after we leave, there’s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who’ve been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!I admire Trump for being consistently against war in the Middle East. But now we have a huge problem that’s only getting worse: who do you think can fix it?

Judy Strauss is the Executive Director and coordinator of the Fit Parenthood Initiative, based out of Cedar Springs, Iowa. For the past two years Judy has made it her primary goal to mandate a law requiring all parents of children under the ages of 16 years old to be physically fit. Backed by several prominent law makers, she is close to seeing her dream finalized when Iowa Legislature votes on parental fitness tests mandatory for couples and individuals looking to have a child.Civic Tribune spoke with Mrs. Strauss on Monday and inquired her motivation and what she eventually hopes to achieve with this new law. She had the following to say:“People don’t seem to understand that parenthood is a privilege, not a right. The numbers of children being born into homes where parents are inadequate is absolutely staggering. In many cases, we have unhealthy people who simply run rampant, producing several children that they are unable to care for on any level.”“Foster care and adoption services absorb some of these costs but the overall damage inflicted by these unfortunate couplings is long-lasting and tangible. There has been several instances where adoptive parents do their best to raise a child in the correct manner, but the child’s genetic programming is too strong to ignore, regardless of efforts and investments of the adopter. It’s clearly nature over nurture in a lot of cases. These heartbreaking scenarios happens every day. We are simply trying to control the number of children born to adults who are biologically hardwired for failure, disease and addiction.”The Bill has caused quite a stir in the Midwestern region and even gained country-wide notoriety after being parodied on Saturday Night Live. In addition to being slammed by several local politicians, the proposal is unwelcome by the majority of residents.The program provides no-cost pregnancy termination services for those who have failed their parental adequacy tests.

Next StoryEinstein’s theory of gravity explains gravity as a distortion of space that’s caused by the presence of matter or energy. This has long been considered the genius that changed science’s perception of gravity. However, researchers at the University of St Andrews may be giving Einstein a run for his money, having found a gigantic ring of galaxies darting away from us much quicker than predicted.The 10 million light year-wide ring is made up of small galaxies that are expanding rapidly like a mini Big Bang. According to the researchers, at some point in time our neighbouring galaxy, Andromeda, flew past our own galaxy at close range, slingshotting off several small galaxies in the process.“If Einstein’s Gravity were correct, our Galaxy would never come close enough to Andromeda to scatter anything that fast,” explains one of the team, Hongsheng Zhao from the University of St Andrews in Scotland.The discovery, if proven correct, would create a whole new understanding of gravity and our cosmos, considering a galactic flyby is only plausible if, as galaxies move away from one another, gravity weakens more slowly than Einstein’s theory suggests.“The ring-like distribution is very peculiar. These small galaxies are like a string of raindrops flung out from a spinning umbrella. I found there is barely a 1 in 640 chance for randomly distributed galaxies to line up in the observed way. I traced their origin to a dynamical event when the Universe was only half its present age,” says Indranil Banik, the PhD student who led the study.“The high galactocentric radial velocities (GRVs) of some Local Group galaxies must have been caused by forces acting on them that our model does not account for,” the researchers say in their paper.Furthermore, these galaxies exist on the same plane of the Universe as the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy, which the researchers argue is unlikely to be a coincidence.The tsunami-like wake in the sky, then, was likely the result of a near-miss of the speeding Andromeda galaxy with the Milky Way. Orbiting each other in a plane, the the two galaxies would have pushed aside dwarf galaxies in their trails. This may reveal why the speeding dwarfs are in a plane with the Milky Way and Andromeda.“In Einstein’s gravity paradigm, hypothetical dark matter is always invoked. Such a high speed requires 60 times the mass we see in the stars of the Milky Way and Andromeda. However, the friction between their huge halos of dark matter would result in them merging rather than flying 2.5 million light years apart, as they must have done.,” Banik says.Though we’ll have to see where this study leads, the possibilities it opens up for theoretical physics are exciting.“Science progresses through challenges,” says Marcel Pawlowski, a Hubble Fellow at the University of California, Irvine, who elicited Banik’s discovery. “Together with two other known planes of closer-in satellites, this gigantic ring forms a serious challenge to the standard paradigm.” Why are vaccines the greatest controversy of the 21st century?

Posted by Trenton Paul | Mar 28, 2017 | American StrengthAdvertisementVice President Mike Pence addressed the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference, where he spoke on the “unbreakable” bond between the United States and Israel.Vice President Mike Pence, speaking to nearly 20,000 members of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference, sought to assure the pro-Israel community of the Trump administration’s backing. He also made it clear that President Trump is interested in promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace, an issue that had led to friction between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Obama administration.“Under President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this — America stands with Israel,” Pence declared during Sunday’s speech. “President Trump and I stand with Israel for the same reason every freedom-loving American stands with Israel — because her cause is our cause, her values are our values and her fight is our fight.” He continued, “I say with confidence, to all gathered here, President Trump and I stand without apology for Israel and we always will.”AIPAC’s annual meeting is an overpowering display of size and wealth, dazzling enough to crowd out the obvious anxieties and disagreements, at least for a couple of days. Appropriately, the theme of this year’s conference was “Many Voices, One Message,” which Pence conveyed throughout his speech.AdvertisementThe vice president also spoke on Trump’s campaign promise to consider moving the U.S. Embassy away from Tel Aviv. “After decades of simply talking about it, the President of the United States is giving serious consideration to moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,” he said. His comments on the embassy come after last month’s meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu, in which Trump said the administration was looking into the move “very, very strongly” and “with great care.” What better time to make an official announcement than one of the largest conferences for the Israeli people, right?Pence noted that while there will be compromises during the talks between Israel and Palestine, “President Trump will never compromise the safety and security of the Jewish State Israel.”AdvertisementPence also took some time to address the Islamic Republic of Iran’s efforts to destabilize the Middle East. Of course Israel has been the subject of threats from Iran.“The Ayatollahs in Tehran openly admit their desire to wipe Israel off the map and drive its people into the sea,” Pence said. “America will no longer tolerate Iran’s efforts to destabilize the region and jeopardize Israel’s security.” He told them that “under President Donald Trump, the United States of America will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. This is our solemn promise to you, to Israel, and to the world. History attests that enmity toward the Jewish people often turns from evil thought to evil action.”The Iranian regime’s main goal is to wipe Israel off the map. In his speech, VP Pence urged the Israeli people to stay strong.As he continued his speech, Pence used the opportunity to talk about American strength and what it means to people all over the world. He began to speak of a Holocaust survivor he met during a visit to the first Nazi concentration camp in Dachau, Germany, while attending a security conference in the region last month. He talked about the survivor, a 93-year-old tour guide named Abdi Noor, who was imprisoned at the camp at 17 years old. Pence described the torture Noor had to undergo while he was imprisoned, but then he mentioned what he called the defining moment of his trip. Advertisement“Then he stopped, looked up at me with tears in his eyes and said words I’ll never forget. He said, ‘Then the Americans came.’ I was so proud. Those words underscored the imperative of American strength, and they powerfully remind us of the immutable bond between our people and the people of Israel,” said Pence. He added, “Under President Trump’s leadership, America will be strong, stronger than ever before.”Pence visits a Nazi concentration camp in Dachau, Germany alongside his tour guide, Abdi Noor, last month.In his closing statements, Pence left on a high note by saying, “I know with all of my heart that with your help, with God’s help, and with the strong leadership of President Donald Trump, our nations and our people will remain forever friends, and we will go forth together to meet the glorious future that awaits. Thank you. God bless you, God bless Israel, and God bless the United States of America.”Pence’s attendance at the AIPAC conference is seen as an effort to encourage strength from Israel as it goes through a tough period that includes the country’s peace talks with Palestine, as well as the threats from Iran looming over the Israeli people.His speech also comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Beijing last week to discuss the Asian country’s influence on the Middle East. AdvertisementDuring the visit, Netanyahu expressed his desire to work with China on technological advances in Israel. “We have always believed, as we discussed on my previous visit, that Israel can be a partner, a junior partner, but a perfect partner for China in the development of a variety of technologies that change the way we live, how long we live, how healthy we live, the water we drink, the food we eat, the milk that we drink – in every area,” he said. President Xi also commented on the current talks between Palestine and Israel, saying, “A peaceful, stable, developing Middle East accords with the common interests of all, including China and Israel. Peaceful coexistence between Israel and Palestine would be good for both parties and the region and is what the international community favors.” Chinese President Xi Jinping and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met in Beijing last week as part of an effort for the two countries to work together in the technology industry. A better alliance between China and Israel could also help the U.S.’s ties to China.President Xi is expected to attend a two-day summit at Mar-a-Lago with President Trump early next month. Now that both Xi and Pence have spoken on the importance of a strong alliance with Israel and agree that peace in the Middle East is the best option, perhaps their actions will also help strengthen the ties between the United States and China.Share:








Advertisement - story continues belowAdults don’t ask kids for help — that’s the lesson one mom taught her children that likely saved them from a horrific situation.When Jodie Norton became seriously sick in May 2016, she drove herself to the emergency room and left her two sons, age 8 and 10, outside the hospital to wait for a neighbor to take them to school.While they waited, three adults approached the boys and attempted to lure them into a bathroom under the guise of “helping” their friend who was “sick.” The boys, however, weren’t easily tricked, as they remembered the lesson their mother had taught them about adults who ask for help.Advertisement - story continues belowIn a blog post about the incident, Norton explained that, in hindsight, she realized the decision to let the children sit outside the hospital without an adult was “stupid,” but she was in intense pain and thought her neighbor was only a few minutes away.During their time alone, the boys encountered three “tricky people” — two males and an adult female who asked the kids if they would “help them out by going into the bathroom where her boyfriend was hiding from the doctor and see if they could convince him to come out and get treated.”The oldest boy, CJ, told the stranger “no, thank you,” but the female persisted, telling them that they could potentially save the man’s life.Advertisement - story continues belowThankfully, the boys had been warned about “tricky” adults and continued to decline the advances.“CJ said he returned all three of their pleas for help with a ‘no, thank you,’ each stronger than the last, before they finally let up,” Norton explained in the blog post.Of course, as soon as the adult neighbor showed up to pick up the boys, the male who was supposedly “sick” in the bathroom came out, got into the car with the other three perverts, and drove off.When her son told her about the incident and his response, Norton felt grateful that she had warned her children about adults asking kids for help.Advertisement - story continues below“Mom, I knew they were tricky people because they were asking us for help. Adults don’t ask kids for help,” CJ told his mom.Norton notified the police about her children’s experience and surveillance footage from the hospital’s security cameras was pulled to help them locate the predators.In the meantime, the mom hoped that her boys’ experience would encourage other families to discuss what to do in an uncomfortable situation like this one. The world can be a dangerous place for kids. It’s best that they’re prepared.H/T Independent Journal ReviewLike and share this article on Facebook and Twitter if you like the lesson this mom taught her children that likely saved them from abuse.What do you think about teaching children this concept of “adults don’t ask kids for help”?

Special Report: The mainstream U.S. media obsesses over Russian “propaganda” yet the U.S. government created a “psyops” bureaucracy three decades ago to flood the world with dubious information, reports Robert Parry.By Robert ParryNewly declassified documents from the Reagan presidential library help explain how the U.S. government developed its sophisticated psychological operations capabilities that – over the past three decades – have created an alternative reality both for people in targeted countries and for American citizens, a structure that expanded U.S. influence abroad and quieted dissent at home.Walter Raymond Jr., a CIA propaganda and disinformation specialist who oversaw President Reagan’s “perception management” and psyops projects at the National Security Council. Raymond is partially obscured by President Reagan and is sitting next to National Security Adviser John Poindexter.. (Photo credit: Reagan presidential library)The documents reveal the formation of a psyops bureaucracy under the direction of Walter Raymond Jr., a senior CIA covert operations specialist who was assigned to President Reagan’s National Security Council staff to enhance the importance of propaganda and psyops in undermining U.S. adversaries around the world and ensuring sufficient public support for foreign policies inside the United States.Raymond, who has been compared to a character from a John LeCarré novel slipping easily into the woodwork, spent his years inside Reagan’s White House as a shadowy puppet master who tried his best to avoid public attention or – it seems – even having his picture taken. From the tens of thousands of photographs from meetings at Reagan’s White House, I found only a couple showing Raymond – and he is seated in groups, partially concealed by other officials.But Raymond appears to have grasped his true importance. In his NSC files, I found a doodle of an organizational chart that had Raymond at the top holding what looks like the crossed handles used by puppeteers to control the puppets below them. Although it’s impossible to know exactly what the doodler had in mind, the drawing fits the reality of Raymond as the behind-the-curtains operative who was controlling the various inter-agency task forces that were responsible for implementing various propaganda and psyops strategies.Until the 1980s, psyops were normally regarded as a military technique for undermining the will of an enemy force by spreading lies, confusion and terror. A classic case was Gen. Edward Lansdale — considered the father of modern psyops — draining the blood from a dead Filipino rebel in such a way so the dead rebel’s superstitious comrades would think that a vampire-like creature was on the prowl. In Vietnam, Lansdale’s psyops team supplied fake and dire astrological predictions for the fate of North Vietnamese and Vietcong leaders.Essentially, the psyops idea was to play on the cultural weaknesses of a target population so they could be more easily manipulated and controlled. But the challenges facing the Reagan administration in the 1980s led to its determination that peacetime psyops were also needed and that the target populations had to include the American public.The Reagan administration was obsessed with the problems left behind by the 1970s’ disclosures of government lying about the Vietnam War and revelations about CIA abuses both in overthrowing democratically elected governments and spying on American dissidents. This so-called “Vietnam Syndrome” produced profound skepticism from regular American citizens as well as journalists and politicians when President Reagan tried to sell his plans for intervention in the civil wars then underway in Central America, Africa and elsewhere.While Reagan saw Central America as a “Soviet beachhead,” many Americans saw brutal Central American oligarchs and their bloody security forces slaughtering priests, nuns, labor activists, students, peasants and indigenous populations. Reagan and his advisers realized that they had to turn those perceptions around if they hoped to get sustained funding for the militaries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras as well as for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the CIA-organized paramilitary force marauding around leftist-ruled Nicaragua.So, it became a high priority to reshape public perceptions to gain support for Reagan’s Central American military operations both inside those targeted countries and among Americans.A ‘Psyops Totality’As Col. Alfred R. Paddock Jr. wrote in an influential November 1983 paper, entitled “Military Psychological Operations and US Strategy,” “the planned use of communications to influence attitudes or behavior should, if properly used, precede, accompany, and follow all applications of force. Put another way, psychological operations is the one weapons system which has an important role to play in peacetime, throughout the spectrum of conflict, and during the aftermath of conflict.”President Ronald Reagan leading a meeting on terrorism on Jan. 26, 1981, with National Security Advisor Richard Allen, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and White House counselor Edwin Meese. (photo credit: Reagan library)Paddock continued, “Military psychological operations are an important part of the ‘PSYOP Totality,’ both in peace and war. … We need a program of psychological operations as an integral part of our national security policies and programs. … The continuity of a standing interagency board or committee to provide the necessary coordinating mechanism for development of a coherent, worldwide psychological operations strategy is badly needed.”Some of Raymond’s recently available handwritten notes show a focus on El Salvador with the implementation of “Nation wide multi-media psyops” spread through rallies and electronic media. “Radio + TV also carried Psyops messages,” Raymond wrote. (Emphasis in original.) Though Raymond’s crimped handwriting is often hard to decipher, the notes make clear that psyops programs also were directed at Honduras, Guatemala and Peru.One declassified “top secret” document in Raymond’s file – dated Feb. 4, 1985, from Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger – urged the fuller implementation of President Reagan’s National Security Decision Directive 130, which was signed on March 6, 1984, and which authorized peacetime psyops by expanding psyops beyond its traditional boundaries of active military operations into peacetime situations in which the U.S. government could claim some threat to national interests.“This approval can provide the impetus to the rebuilding of a necessary strategic capability, focus attention on psychological operations as a national – not solely military – instrument, and ensure that psychological operations are fully coordinated with public diplomacy and other international information activities,” Weinberger’s document said.This broader commitment to psyops led to the creation of a Psychological Operations Committee (POC) that was to be chaired by a representative of Reagan’s National Security Council with a vice chairman from the Pentagon and with representatives from the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department and the U.S. Information Agency.“This group will be responsible for planning, coordinating and implementing psychological operations activities in support of United States policies and interests relative to national security,” according to a “secret” addendum to a memo, dated March 25, 1986, from Col. Paddock, the psyops advocate who had become the U.S. Army’s Director for Psychological Operations.“The committee will provide the focal point for interagency coordination of detailed contingency planning for the management of national information assets during war, and for the transition from peace to war,” the addendum added. “The POC shall seek to ensure that in wartime or during crises (which may be defined as periods of acute tension involving a threat to the lives of American citizens or the imminence of war between the U.S. and other nations), U.S. international information elements are ready to initiate special procedures to ensure policy consistency, timely response and rapid feedback from the intended audience.”Taking ShapeThe Psychological Operations Committee took formal shape with a “secret” memo from Reagan’s National Security Advisor John Poindexter on July 31, 1986. Its first meeting was called on Sept. 2, 1986, with an agenda that focused on Central America and “How can other POC agencies support and complement DOD programs in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama.” The POC was also tasked with “Developing National PSYOPS Guidelines” for “formulating and implementing a national PSYOPS program.” (Underlining in original)Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush with CIA Director William Casey at the White House on Feb. 11, 1981. (Photo credit: Reagan Library)Raymond was named a co-chair of the POC along with CIA officer Vincent Cannistraro, who was then Deputy Director for Intelligence Programs on the NSC staff, according to a “secret” memo from Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Craig Alderman Jr. The memo also noted that future POC meetings would be briefed on psyops projects for the Philippines and Nicaragua, with the latter project codenamed “Niagara Falls.” The memo also references a “Project Touchstone,” but it is unclear where that psyops program was targeted.Another “secret” memo dated Oct. 1, 1986, co-authored by Raymond, reported on the POC’s first meeting on Sept. 10, 1986, and noted that “The POC will, at each meeting, focus on an area of operations (e.g., Central America, Afghanistan, Philippines).”The POC’s second meeting on Oct. 24, 1986, concentrated on the Philippines, according to a Nov. 4, 1986 memo also co-authored by Raymond. “The next step will be a tightly drafted outline for a PSYOPS Plan which we will send to that Embassy for its comment,” the memo said. The plan “largely focused on a range of civic actions supportive of the overall effort to overcome the insurgency,” an addendum noted. “There is considerable concern about the sensitivities of any type of a PSYOPS program given the political situation in the Philippines today.”Earlier in 1986, the Philippines had undergone the so-called “People Power Revolution,” which drove longtime dictator Ferdinand Marcos into exile, and the Reagan administration, which belatedly pulled its support from Marcos, was trying to stabilize the political situation to prevent more populist elements from gaining the upper hand.But the Reagan administration’s primary attention continued to go back to Central America, including “Project Niagara Falls,” the psyops program aimed at Nicaragua. A “secret” Pentagon memo from Deputy Under Secretary Alderman on Nov. 20, 1986, outlined the work of the 4th Psychological Operations Group on this psyops plan “to help bring about democratization of Nicaragua,” by which the Reagan administration meant a “regime change.” The precise details of “Project Niagara Falls” were not disclosed in the declassified documents but the choice of codename suggested a cascade of psyops.Other documents from Raymond’s NSC file shed light on who other key operatives in the psyops and propaganda programs were. For instance, in undated notes on efforts to influence the Socialist International, including securing support for U.S. foreign policies from Socialist and Social Democratic parties in Europe, Raymond cited the efforts of “Ledeen, Gershman,” a reference to neoconservative operative Michael Ledeen and Carl Gershman, another neocon who has served as president of the U.S.-government-funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED), from 1983 to the present. (Underlining in original.)Although NED is technically independent of the U.S. government, it receives the bulk of its funding (now about $100 million a year) from Congress. Documents from the Reagan archives also make clear that NED was organized as a way to replace some of the CIA’s political and propaganda covert operations, which had fallen into disrepute in the 1970s. Earlier released documents from Raymond’s file show CIA Director William Casey pushing for NED’s creation and Raymond, Casey’s handpicked man on the NSC, giving frequent advice and direction to Gershman. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “CIA’s Hidden Hand in ‘Democracy’ Groups.”]Another figure in Raymond’s constellation of propaganda assets was media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who was viewed as both a key political ally of President Reagan and a valuable source of funding for private groups that were coordinating with White House propaganda operations. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “Rupert Murdoch: Propaganda Recruit.”]In a Nov. 1, 1985 letter to Raymond, Charles R. Tanguy of the “Committees for a Community of Democracies – USA” asked Raymond to intervene in efforts to secure Murdoch’s funding for the group. “We would be grateful … if you could find the time to telephone Mr. Murdoch and encourage him to give us a positive response,” the letter said.Another document, entitled “Project Truth Enhancement,” described how $24 million would be spent on upgrading the telecommunications infrastructure to arm “Project Truth, with the technical capability to provide the most efficient and productive media support for major USG policy initiatives like Political Democracy.” Project Truth was the overarching name of the Reagan administration’s propaganda operation. For the outside world, the program was billed as “public diplomacy,” but administration insiders privately called it “perception management.” [See Consortiumnews.com’s “The Victory of Perception Management.”]The Early YearsThe original priority of “Project Truth” was to clean up the images of the Guatemalan and Salvadoran security forces and the Nicaraguan Contras, who were led by ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza’s ex-National Guard officers. To ensure steady military funding for these notorious forces, Reagan’s team knew it had to defuse the negative publicity and somehow rally the American people’s support.President Ronald Reagan meeting with Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt, who was later charged with genocide against indigenous populations in Guatemala’s highlands.At first, the effort focused on weeding out American reporters who uncovered facts that undercut the desired public images. As part of that effort, the administration denounced New York Times correspondent Raymond Bonner for disclosing the Salvadoran regime’s massacre of about 800 men, women and children in the village of El Mozote in northeast El Salvador in December 1981. Accuracy in Media and conservative news organizations, such as The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, joined in pummeling Bonner, who was soon ousted from his job. But such efforts were largely ad hoc and disorganized.CIA Director Casey, from his years crisscrossing the interlocking worlds of business and intelligence, had important contacts for creating a more systematic propaganda network. He recognized the value of using established groups known for advocating “human rights,” such as Freedom House.One document from the Reagan library showed senior Freedom House official Leo Cherne running a draft manuscript on political conditions in El Salvador past Casey and promising that Freedom House would make requested editorial “corrections and changes” – and even send over the editor for consultation with whomever Casey assigned to review the paper.In a “Dear Bill” letter dated June 24, 1981, Cherne, who was chairman of the Freedom House’s executive committee, wrote: “I am enclosing a copy of the draft manuscript by Bruce McColm, Freedom House’s resident specialist on Central America and the Caribbean. This manuscript on El Salvador was the one I had urged be prepared and in the haste to do so as rapidly as possible, it is quite rough. You had mentioned that the facts could be checked for meticulous accuracy within the government and this would be very helpful. …“If there are any questions about the McColm manuscript, I suggest that whomever is working on it contact Richard Salzmann at the Research Institute [an organization where Cherne was executive director]. He is Editor-in-Chief at the Institute and the Chairman of the Freedom House’s Salvador Committee. He will make sure that the corrections and changes get to Rita Freedman who will also be working with him. If there is any benefit to be gained from Salzmann’s coming down at any point to talk to that person, he is available to do so.”By 1982, Casey also was lining up some powerful right-wing ideologues to help fund the “perception management” project both with money and their own media outlets. Richard Mellon Scaife was the scion of the Mellon banking, oil and aluminum fortune who financed a variety of right-wing family foundations – such as Sarah Scaife and Carthage – that were financial benefactors to right-wing journalists and think tanks. Scaife also published the Tribune Review in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.A more comprehensive “public diplomacy” operation began to take shape in 1982 when Raymond, a 30-year veteran of CIA clandestine services, was transferred to the NSC. Raymond became the sparkplug for this high-powered propaganda network, according to an unpublished draft chapter of the congressional Iran-Contra investigation that was suppressed as part of the deal to get three moderate Republican senators to sign on to the final report and give the inquiry a patina of bipartisanship.Though the draft chapter didn’t use Raymond’s name in its opening pages, apparently because some of the information came from classified depositions, Raymond’s name was used later in the chapter and the earlier citations matched Raymond’s known role. According to the draft report, the CIA officer who was recruited for the NSC job had served as Director of the Covert Action Staff at the CIA from 1978 to 1982 and was a “specialist in propaganda and disinformation.”“The CIA official [Raymond] discussed the transfer with [CIA Director] Casey and NSC Advisor William Clark that he be assigned to the NSC as [Donald] Gregg’s successor [as coordinator of intelligence operations in June 1982] and received approval for his involvement in setting up the public diplomacy program along with his intelligence responsibilities,” the chapter said. Gregg was another senior CIA official who was assigned to the NSC before becoming Vice President George H.W. Bush’s national security adviser.“In the early part of 1983, documents obtained by the Select [Iran-Contra] Committees indicate that the Director of the Intelligence Staff of the NSC [Raymond] successfully recommended the establishment of an inter-governmental network to promote and manage a public diplomacy plan designed to create support for Reagan Administration policies at home and abroad.”War of IdeasDuring his Iran-Contra deposition, Raymond explained the need for this propaganda structure, saying: “We were not configured effectively to deal with the war of ideas.”President Reagan meets with publisher Rupert Murdoch, U.S. Information Agency Director Charles Wick, lawyers Roy Cohn and Thomas Bolan in the Oval Office on Jan. 18, 1983. (Photo credit: Reagan presidential library)One reason for this shortcoming was that federal law forbade taxpayers’ money from being spent on domestic propaganda or grassroots lobbying to pressure congressional representatives. Of course, every president and his team had vast resources to make their case in public, but by tradition and law, they were restricted to speeches, testimony and one-on-one persuasion of lawmakers. But President Reagan saw the American public’s “Vietnam Syndrome” as an obstacle to his more aggressive policies.Along with Raymond’s government-based organization, there were outside groups eager to cooperate and cash in. Back at Freedom House, Cherne and his associates were angling for financial support.In an Aug. 9, 1982 letter to Raymond, Freedom House executive director Leonard R. Sussman wrote that “Leo Cherne has asked me to send these copies of Freedom Appeals. He has probably told you we have had to cut back this project to meet financial realities. … We would, of course, want to expand the project once again when, as and if the funds become available. Offshoots of that project appear in newspapers, magazines, books and on broadcast services here and abroad. It’s a significant, unique channel of communication” – precisely the focus of Raymond’s work.On Nov. 4, 1982, Raymond, after his transfer from the CIA to the NSC staff but while still a CIA officer, wrote to NSC Advisor Clark about the “Democracy Initiative and Information Programs,” stating that “Bill Casey asked me to pass on the following thought concerning your meeting with [right-wing billionaire] Dick Scaife, Dave Abshire [then a member of the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board], and Co. Casey had lunch with them today and discussed the need to get moving in the general area of supporting our friends around the world.“By this definition he is including both ‘building democracy’ … and helping invigorate international media programs. The DCI [Casey] is also concerned about strengthening public information organizations in the United States such as Freedom House. … A critical piece of the puzzle is a serious effort to raise private funds to generate momentum. Casey’s talk with Scaife and Co. suggests they would be very willing to cooperate. … Suggest that you note White House interest in private support for the Democracy initiative.”The importance of the CIA and White House secretly arranging private funds was that these supposedly independent voices would then reinforce and validate the administration’s foreign policy arguments with a public that would assume the endorsements were based on the merits of the White House positions, not influenced by money changing hands. Like snake-oil salesmen who plant a few cohorts in the crowd to whip up excitement for the cure-all elixir, Reagan administration propagandists salted some well-paid “private” individuals around Washington to echo White House propaganda “themes.”The role of the CIA in these initiatives was concealed but never far from the surface. A Dec. 2, 1982 note addressed to “Bud,” a reference to senior NSC official Robert “Bud” McFarlane, described a request from Raymond for a brief meeting. “When he [Raymond] returned from Langley [CIA headquarters], he had a proposed draft letter … re $100 M democ[racy]  proj[ect],” the note said.While Casey pulled the strings on this project, the CIA director instructed White House officials to hide the CIA’s hand. “Obviously we here [at CIA] should not get out front in the development of such an organization, nor should we appear to be a sponsor or advocate,” Casey said in one undated letter to then-White House counselor Edwin Meese III as Casey urged creation of a “National Endowment.”But the formation of the National Endowment for Democracy, with its hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. government money, was still months down the road. In the meantime, the Reagan administration would have to line up private donors to advance the propaganda cause.“We will develop a scenario for obtaining private funding,” NSC Advisor Clark wrote to Reagan in a Jan. 13, 1983 memo, adding that U.S. Information Agency Director “Charlie Wick has offered to take the lead. We may have to call on you to meet with a group of potential donors.”Despite Casey’s and Raymond’s success in bringing onboard wealthy conservatives to provide private funding for the propaganda operations, Raymond worried about whether a scandal could erupt over the CIA’s involvement. Raymond formally resigned from the CIA in April 1983, so, he said, “there would be no question whatsoever of any contamination of this.” But Raymond continued to act toward the U.S. public much like a CIA officer would in directing a propaganda operation in a hostile foreign country.Raymond fretted, too, about the legality of Casey’s ongoing role. Raymond confided in one memo that it was important “to get [Casey] out of the loop,” but Casey never backed off and Raymond continued to send progress reports to his old boss well into 1986.It was “the kind of thing which [Casey] had a broad catholic interest in,” Raymond shrugged during his Iran-Contra deposition. He then offered the excuse that Casey undertook this apparently illegal interference in domestic politics “not so much in his CIA hat, but in his adviser to the president hat.”Peacetime PropagandaMeanwhile, Reagan began laying out the formal authority for this unprecedented peacetime propaganda bureaucracy. On Jan. 14, 1983, Reagan signed National Security Decision Directive 77, entitled “Management of Public Diplomacy Relative to National Security.” In NSDD-77, Reagan deemed it “necessary to strengthen the organization, planning and coordination of the various aspects of public diplomacy of the United States Government.”President Reagan meeting with Charles Wick on March 7, 1986, in the Oval Office. Also present: Stephen Rhinesmith, Don Regan, John Poindexter, George Bush, Jack Matlock and Walter Raymond (seated next to Regan on the left side of the photo). (Photo credit: Reagan library)Reagan ordered the creation of a special planning group within the National Security Council to direct these “public diplomacy” campaigns. The planning group would be headed by Walter Raymond and one of its principal outposts would be a new Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America, housed at the State Department but under the control of the NSC. (One of the directors of the Latin American public diplomacy office was neoconservative Robert Kagan, who would later co-found the Project for the New American Century in 1998 and become a chief promoter of President George W. Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.)On May 20, 1983, Raymond recounted in a memo that $400,000 had been raised from private donors brought to the White House Situation Room by U.S. Information Agency Director Charles Wick. According to that memo, the money was divided among several organizations, including Freedom House and Accuracy in Media, a right-wing media attack organization.When I wrote about that memo in my 1992 book, Fooling America, Freedom House denied receiving any White House money or collaborating with any CIA/NSC propaganda campaign. In a letter, Freedom House’s Sussman called Raymond “a second-hand source” and insisted that “this organization did not need any special funding to take positions … on any foreign-policy issues.”But it made little sense that Raymond would have lied to a superior in an internal memo. And clearly, Freedom House remained central to the Reagan administration’s schemes for aiding groups supportive of its Central American policies, particularly the CIA-organized Contra war against the leftist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. Plus, White House documents released later revealed that Freedom House kept its hand out for funding.On Sept. 15, 1984, Bruce McColm – writing from Freedom House’s Center for Caribbean and Central American Studies – sent Raymond “a short proposal for the Center’s Nicaragua project 1984-85. The project combines elements of the oral history proposal with the publication of The Nicaraguan Papers,” a book that would disparage Sandinista ideology and practices.“Maintaining the oral history part of the project adds to the overall costs; but preliminary discussions with film makers have given me the idea that an Improper Conduct-type of documentary could be made based on these materials,” McColm wrote, referring to a 1984 film that offered a scathing critique of Fidel Castro’s Cuba. “Such a film would have to be the work of a respected Latin American filmmaker or a European. American-made films on Central America are simply too abrasive ideologically and artistically poor.”McColm’s three-page letter reads much like a book or movie pitch, trying to interest Raymond in financing the project: “The Nicaraguan Papers will also be readily accessible to the general reader, the journalist, opinion-maker, the academic and the like. The book would be distributed fairly broadly to these sectors and I am sure will be extremely useful. They already constitute a form of Freedom House samizdat, since I’ve been distributing them to journalists for the past two years as I’ve received them from disaffected Nicaraguans.”McColm proposed a face-to-face meeting with Raymond in Washington and attached a six-page grant proposal seeking $134,100. According to the grant proposal, the project would include “free distribution to members of Congress and key public officials; distribution of galleys in advance of publication for maximum publicity and timely reviews in newspapers and current affairs magazines; press conferences at Freedom House in New York and at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.; op-ed circulation to more than 100 newspapers …; distribution of a Spanish-language edition through Hispanic organizations in the United States and in Latin America; arrangement of European distribution through Freedom House contacts.”The documents that I found at the Reagan library did not indicate what subsequently happened to this specific proposal. McColm did not respond to an email request for comment about the Nicaraguan Papers plan or the earlier letter from Cherne (who died in 1999) to Casey about editing McComb’s manuscript. Freedom House did emerge as a leading critic of Nicaragua’s Sandinista government and also became a major recipient of money from the U.S.-funded National Endowment for Democracy, which was founded in 1983 under the umbrella of the Casey-Raymond project.The more recently released documents – declassified between 2013 and 2017 – show how these earlier Casey-Raymond efforts merged with the creation of a formal psyop bureaucracy in 1986 also under the control of Raymond’s NSC operation. The combination of the propaganda and psyop programs underscored the powerful capability that the U.S. government developed more than three decades ago for planting slanted, distorted or fake news. (Casey died in 1987; Raymond died in 2003.)Over those several decades, even as the White House changed hands from Republicans to Democrats to Republicans to Democrats, the momentum created by William Casey and Walter Raymond continued to push these “perception management/psyops” strategies forward. In more recent years, the wording has changed, giving way to more pleasing euphemisms, like “smart power” and “strategic communications.” But the idea is still the same: how you can use propaganda to sell U.S. government policies abroad and at home.Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

Anxiety — that feeling of dread, fear, worry and panic — is certainly nothing new. Hippocrates wrote about it in the fourth century BCE. As did Søren Kierkegaard in the 1860s. And Sigmund Freud addressed the disorder in 1926.However, jump to the present and we’re seeing a significant uptick — especially with youth.Pharmaceutical drugs tend to be the classic treatment for treating anxiety (as well as the biggest money maker). Cognitive therapy is a common approach as well. Those with a holistic bent often turn to meditation, yoga, massage and other relaxation techniques. Music therapy has also been used with some success. But now neuroscientists in the U.K. have zeroed in on a single song that results in a dramatic 65 percent reduction in overall anxiety…A 2013 survey found that 57 percent of American female university students reported episodes of “overwhelming anxiety.” And in the United Kingdom, the charity YouthNet discovered a third of young women — and one in ten young men — suffer from panic attacks.Marjorie Wallace, CEO of the charity Sane, believes that generation Y (those born in the 1980s and 1990s) is the age of desperation. “Growing up has always been difficult, but this sense of desperation? That’s new,” she says.Writes Rachael Dove in Anxiety: the epidemic sweeping through Generation Y:“So, what’s going on? The rise of technology, overly-protective parenting and “exam-factory” schooling are among the reasons psychologists suggest for our generational angst. Another, brought up on multiple occasions by my peers and by psychologists I spoke to, is the luxury (as ungrateful as it sounds) of too much choice.”Pieter Kruger, a London-based psychologist, says research indicates that people who feel they don’t have a choice are actually more resilient — mainly because they can blame life or others if they make a wrong decision. However, if you have a range of choices, you have no one to blame but yourself. “We become much more obsessive because we want to make the right decision every time,” he says.Writer Claire Eastham, 26, agrees on her blog We Are All Mad Here:“I spend a lot of time worrying about what I am going to do with my life. Previous generations had choice taken out of their hands. If you are told what to do it takes the pressure away.”In our modern era, decision making can trigger a type of paralysis. Often, we will obsessively research the many different options for, say, a pair of shoes. Eventually, information overload will kick in and shut the whole shopping venture down, leaving us exhausted and guilty for being crippled by such a seemingly simple task.Technology also contributes to the rise of anxiety. A good number of millennials feel exposed without their smartphones — and are rarely without them. Mobile gadgets tend to be their window to the world and foster a sense of connectedness. But there’s a dark side to feeling the need to keep on top of what everyone is doing on social media — otherwise known as Fomo, or the Fear of Missing Out.“Fomo is very real and can be a constant addiction that affects anxiety levels and a general sense of wellbeing,” says Kruger.Social media allows us to compare everything — relationships, diet, figure, beauty, wealth, standard of living — not only with our friends, but with celebrities too. And, as research has shown, time on social media “can cause depression in people who compare themselves with others.”Besides revamping our lifestyles and limiting exposure to social media — and learning to work with a sometimes overwhelming abundance of choice — neuroscientists have found listening to a specially designed song can have a profound influence over our levels of anxiety.See also: This Is Why You Should Change The Frequency Of Your Music To 432 HzResearchers at Mindlab International in the U.K. wanted to know what kind of music induces the greatest state of relaxation. The study involved having participants try to solve difficult puzzles — which inherently triggered a certain degree of stress — while connected to sensors. At the same time, participants listened to a range of songs as researchers measured their brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure and rate of breathing.What they found is that one song — “Weightless” — resulted in a striking 65 percent reduction in participants’ overall anxiety, and a 35 percent reduction in their usual physiological resting rates.Interestingly, the song was specifically designed to induce this highly relaxed state. Created by Marconi Union, the musicians teamed up with sound therapists to carefully arrange harmonies, rhythms and bass lines, which in turn slow a listener’s heart rate and blood pressure, while also lowering stress hormones like cortisol.In fact, the music is so effective, that many of the female participants became drowsy — to the point where lead researcher Dr. David Lewis-Hodgson advises against listening to it while driving.But don’t take their word for it.

Newest reports came in, and the show that an Obama appointed attorney is currently refusing to resign, and claims that he will make President Trump fire him. Talking about being stubborn right?Source says US Attorney Preet Bharara doesn't plan to resign, will make President Trump fire him (Reporting from @LauraAJarrett @jaketapper)— Dianne Gallagher (@DianneG) March 11, 2017While we still are not sure what measure President Trump is going to take in the case of this lunatic attorney, we are 100% sure that if he keeps on pushing his limits, he will eventually get fired one way or another.As the days are going by and Trump is becoming more and more famous for his actions which are saving and defining America once again, the Democrats seem to be getting more and more desperate to create scandals, chaos and rallies all in an attempt to receive some sort of attention, as they are not in the spotlight since their dear Obama left office.So it doesn’t matter whether he is forced to resigned or if he waits for President Trump to officialy fire him, one way or another Bharara will meet his end as an Attorney.Share this article to spread the word about this lunatic, and let us all hope that he gets fired as soon as possible!

Donald Trump, “the Moron with a Mouth,”  has grown tired of pandering to liberals, immigrants, and of course, Muslim extremists. Reports close to the President-Elect has said he is responding to HUGE security threats by personally selecting a group of rag-tag mercenaries made up of former military roughnecks and violent psychopathic criminals.The recruits will all be part of a secret government agency tasked with executing black ops missions. They will report directly to ‘The Donald’ himself.Trump reportedly said this to his generals:“I want to put together a team of very bad people who I think can do some good.”Emphasizing his business acumen, he also stated in a heated exchange with Defense Secretary and former General James Mattis:“Getting people to act against their own self interest is what I do for a living.”In exchange for their service, convicts will receive reductions in their sentencing based around the severity and difficulty of the missions completed.Anticipating some push-back from The Batman, Trump started an early campaign in 2013 to turn the Caped Crusader over to his side.Everyone should calm down. @BenAffleck is going to do a great job as Batman.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2013So far the move has panned out well. Batman still has legitimate concerns that a true supervillain may replace Trump in the White House, such as a Mike Pence or even Lex Luthor.








The Ancient Egyptians believed that cats are divine creatures that can see the spirits of the dead.All lazy cat owners have noticed at least a couple of times how their cats look u, hissing angrily at something that the owner can’t see.This ability to detect particular phenomenon, can be demonstrated through photographs taken with sensitive, digital cameras that depict orbs of energy. There exist a couple of photographs in which these spheres, invisible to the naked eye, are clearly visible.Cat watches OrbYou ask yourself how this is possible. Scientists suggest the simple explanation is that it’s a case of optical illusions due to dust. But why would cats get excited by a speck of dust? If , however, it’s a matter of different entities, not necessarily spirits, but perhaps just energy, then this special ability of cats to sense vibrations and frequencies undetectable  by humans, all of this could be explained in scientific terms.This specific sensitivity would allow cats to see objects and phenomena that the untrained human senses cannot perceive. But just because scientists don’t possess the tools to observe a phenomenon, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.Apparently cats possess a large number of specific skills, such as empathy. All cat owners have experienced a situation when you’ve felt unwell, and your cat felt this and come to you in order to transmit energy, in a sense. A stomach ache, a head ache, your cat comes and wants to cuddle with you, giving out energy and a feeling of calm and well-being.This consciousness of pets is used today in Pet Therapy, to successfully treat various psychological ailments. And this is not the only superpower our four-legged friends possess: a think unique in the animal kingdom, the cat tries to sleep on the so-called Hartmann Nodes, which are particular intersections in the Earth’s magnetic field lines, which encircle the whole planet at regular intervals.If a person were to stand over such a node for a longer period of time, he would feel faint. This is not the case for cats, which on the contrary, seem to feel more relaxed on these nodes avoided by all other animals. The ability to detect magnetism is prevalent in many animals, like migratory birds for example. But cats’ abilities go further, as they can sense the Dark Energy that permeates the entire Universe.Is this the secret of cats? Does their warmth have healing powers?  If we consider that this energy – demonstrated through mathematical calculations but not demonstrated in practice because of our sensory deficiency- is related to the ancient ancestral rituals related to the cult of the Mother Goddess, it’s clear why the Ancient Egyptians considered cats divine.  










If you are not familiar with what is happening these days than you should be quick to read the news. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has said some remarkable words for Donald Trump. Saying that Trump is “a clever man” who should be “quick to understand” his role.In a state controlled NTV interview, Putin has said that Donald Trump “is already a statesman”.One thing is certain, and that is the US-Russia relations will improve drastically, as previously voiced by Putin.This is what Mr Putin told the television channel: “Trump was an entrepreneur and a businessman. He is already a statesman, he is the head of the United States of America, one of the world’s leading countries.”“Because he achieved success in business, it suggests that he is a clever man. And if he is a clever man, then he will fully and quite quickly understand another level of responsibility. We assume that he will be acting from these positions.”On the first of December Vladimir Putin added the following. “We don’t want confrontation with anyone. We don’t need it. We are not seeking and have never sought enemies. We need friends.“We are ready to co-operate with the new US administration. We have a shared responsibility to ensure international security,” 








MOMBASA – Kenya – Former U.S president’s brother, Malik has revealed the real birth certificate of Barack Hussein Obama.  It has been a long time coming but former president, Barack Hussein Obama’s real birth certificate has finally been released, this time by his own brother, Malik in Kenya.What the original birth certificate reveals is that Obama was born in Kenya and not in Hawaii as the fake document purported. There were many inconsistencies with the fake Hawaii record but the Kenyan one is as real as it gets.This proves that many people who doubted Obama’s right to be president were correct and one way or another, he has been in the middle of a massive forgery  and fraud attempt that fooled even the highest echelons of the U.S. hierarchy.

March 29, 2017Mike Cernovich is the Mike Tyson of media?More like Mike Tyson is the Mike Cernovich of boxing.Mike Cernovich is on real champion hours, real lawyer hours, he is a titan of media. This is what winners look like.If you hate Mike Cernovich, you are a loser. You have a small penis. You are probably gay. You are jealous.Honestly, if you hate Mike Cernovich, you should just END IT right now.Your life is meaningless, and you are nothing but a drain on society.Because what you little faggots don’t understand is that being the Mike Tyson of media is not about having your own ideas, or presenting other people’s ideas in a moving way. It’s not about whether you’re a Jew or whether you just look and act like one. It’s not about concepts. It’s not about communication. It’s not about coherency or reason.It’s about one thing: mindset.And if your mindset is love, no haters can ever get to you or break you.If you don’t have love in your heart than your pathetic life needs to end.Now.Sheeeit 2 triggerthreads in 2 days.You do realise that's animal cruelty an Hitler was against it right? So edgy of you.Cernojew admits Jewish blood in this recent video:Here's a pic of his, looks like part Paki or dothead wife:I guess that niglet baby on Twitter could be his. shrugsCernovich tells us how Saudi Arabian Muslims, not Jews, control the media:Brandon Martinez / Non-Aligned Media Saudi Arabia sponsored 9/11, controls the CIA and influences US elections, says Alt-Lite huckster Mike Cernovich. Those dastardly Saudi princes are telling Obama, the CIA and the US congress what to do, Cernovich a...The Alt-ristocrats! 
"Several times on Twitter, Mike Cernovich said he was a Jew [...]" quote by Andrew Anglin, December 28, 2016, 'Mike Cernovich, DeploraBall and the Collapse of the Alt-Cuck'https://archive.fo/O28KEIf you claim to be Jew-wise yet find yourself repeatedly promoting race-mixers and/or Jews by writing articles about them even though you know they are cucks and or Jews, you should consider throwing yourself into a bog.He flirted with fascism when it was profitable for him to do so, first having to delete some tweets saying he's Jewish.Sadly a lot of our people went to defend him online in the fall of 2016 when he was still pretending to be something he wasn't, which is a self help book salesman trying to profit off of desperate young White males.People seem to have a hard time to realise that, even if you genuinely believe he's 0% Jewish, someone with a non-White wife is never going to be a genuine White Nationalist.The confusion when he went back to self help books and shilling against WN is something I didn't understand. It was always going to happen.








LD (introducing video) : It is becoming increasingly clear that the ‘Deep State’ is absolutely determined to bring down Trump and replace him with a Hillary proxy. If Trump is forced out of office, evil triumphs. It’s as simple as that. And the millions of honest Americans who voted for Trump, longing desperately for change, will have been given a right royal kick in the ass.What does the Deep State want? Simple. They want a restitution of the status quo — with themselves in charge. The Deep State are wearing the big boots, and they want to go on using those big boots to trample on anyone who gets in their way or challenges their supremacy. This is a death struggle between the elite One Percenters and their vast slave population: the rest of America, the underclass. Trump can be seen as the leader of ‘the Slave Revolt’. He was not expected to win, but now that he has won against all the odds, he has to be removed. As soon as possible. By hook or by crook. The status quo must be restored at all costs, with the Slave Masters in charge. [LD] The video covers a lot of ground and requires several viewings to digest. Thanks for the useful introduction which helps to throw a light on what is going on in the background. The role played by the Federal Reserve (mentioned in the video) is of vital importance. After all, it’s through the Jewish banksters, with their central banks, that the Rothschilds and their minions control not only America but also Europe and many other vassal states.I just learned that the CIA can easily pose as Russian hackers. Links between Trump and alleged highup sources in Russia can therefore be fabricated. Here is Jon Rappoport giving details:Let’s see. The CIA claims that Russian government hackers interfered in the US election, on the side of Trump. But suppose CIA hackers fabricated an operation to make it look like a Russian hack? Too far-fetched? Not anymore.In conjunction with their new data-dump of CIA material, WikiLeaks issues this statement:“The CIA’s Remote Devices Branch’s UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques ‘stolen’ from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ‘fingerprints’ of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.”A group within the CIA wanted to shift blame for Hillary Clinton’s defeat? How about pointing at the Russians? “Easy. We can use Russian hacking tools and fabricate a scenario. We can say we discovered ‘fingerprints’ that point to the Russian government.”https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/wikileaks-cia-hackers-can-pose-as-russians-ring-a-bell/The interesting part is, Sardonicus, that whether or not it was Russian (or any other source of instigation) it has been played as a matter of ‘WHO’ rather than a matter of ‘WHAT’.  Killing the messenger has taken priority over considering the message.  For example, many people are not aware of the recent arrests and impending exposure of widespread pedophile activity among these “deep staters” – which the msm has kept at low key.  They are terrified.   Instigated and cited via the term “Pizzagate”, it has already accounted for the arrest and prosecution of contingents of ‘The Swamp’.  The drain is flowing, and will be hard to plug – and in their panic, the dark minions will do much damage, and what should be ‘small’ matters will be inflated to ‘big’.   I get the feeling that Trump’s strongest supporters understand this, and do not care whether or not it causes chaos.   Trump is only the messenger, in many respects, and we should stay focused on the message.Why would the Jew World Order in the US (e.g. the Media, Academia, Intelligence) force a Jew-friendly Trump into a trap?  This does not compute.  It is more likely a Kabuki Grande sil vous plait.  Let us follow Lobro’s advice and “scour” the Jewish press — you don’t have to look hard.Jew-media on Jew-friendly Trump…When he bought his Florida home and turned it into a popular and exclusive country club, he specifically opened the membership up to Jews. Mar-a-Lago was the first club that ever allowed Jews in Palm Beach. Donald changed the customs of the most-wealthy, WASP-y town in America to favor Jews.http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/20/trump-is-headed-to-white-house-did-just-elect-our-first-jewish-president.htmlIf walks like a duck?  Recall the fake Menshivik/Bolshevik split?  Kerensky was most likely a crypto.  I am starting to suspect Trump of being a crypto also and we’re witnessing the manufacturing of a crisis in the US.Oi Vey!Kikar Shabbat has recently released a rare photograph showing Fred Trump, father of United States President-elect Donald Trump, whodonated land that he owned for the establishment of a Talmud Torah (cheder) in Flatbush, New Yor

I think Trump is not just a puppet but another crypto Jew in charge.  No I don’t have a smoking gun but logic and circumstantial evidence are enough for me to form an opinion. Just my own belief. Here’s hopin’ that Putin is the real thing.PS Trump’s ancestors in Germany also have the whiff of Jewish ancestry.Oops, forgot to add to this list…“Jew World Order in the US (e.g. the Media, Academia, Intelligence) ”…BANKING 😀The system produced Trump; the system is Jewish through and through; and Donald Trump is most likely a Jew.I bid you adieu.@ FlopotI bid you adieu.That’s the third time you’ve said goodbye and come slinking back. Make up your mind! I’d be sorry to see you go because your contributions to this site, in my humble opinion, are second to none.Some of your posts are truly brilliant, though of course one doesn’t have to agree with everything you say.However, I regret to tell you that your recent behavior leaves much to be desired.

It saddens me to think that such an intelligent man should be so woefully deficient in self-control.FLOPOT asks: “Why would the Jew World Order in the US (e.g. the Media, Academia, Intelligence) force a Jew-friendly Trump into a trap?”Answer: Media, Academia, Intelligence, Banking = globalists. Trump = nationalists. We are witnessing nationalists butting heads with globalists. Me thinks globalists and globalism is waning.

Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.Code-named “Vault 7” by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.
The first full part of the series, “Year Zero”, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.“Year Zero” introduces the scope and direction of the CIA’s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of “zero day” weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency’s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA’s hacking capacities.By the end of 2016, the CIA’s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency’s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other “weaponized” malware. Such is the scale of the CIA’s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its “own NSA” with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.Once a single cyber ‘weapon’ is ‘loose’ it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.CIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVsCIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA’s DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA (see this organizational chart of the CIA for more details).The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide.The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell’s 1984, but “Weeping Angel”, developed by the CIA’s Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization.The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom’s MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a ‘Fake-Off’ mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In ‘Fake-Off’ mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. The CIA’s Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user’s geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone’s camera and microphone.Despite iPhone’s minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA’s Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA’s arsenal includes numerous local and remote “zero days” developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.[much much more at the links above]@Pat – Seeing the all-encompassing scope of Big Brother (as further revealed by Wikileaks), perhaps I’m lucky that I’m too technologically dumb to know how to use a smart phone.

Of course, Big Brother could get me for posting on subversive sites like this one, but that’s a chance I’m gladly willing to take.Foll –Billy would say, “I feel your pain.” 🙂If you have a Driver License or SS Number or Registered to Vote…. they got ya already.

….. from the engine room.Take your topsiders off every couple of weeks or so..  🙂There is something that I do not understand. Why the people who voted Trump do not march on the streets or fill the roads and squares in the most important US cities? How is it possible there are only anti-Trump protests and no pro-Trump support?
Aren’t there any or do media hide them?
Gian Franco
ItalyGFS –“Aren’t there any or do media hide them?”There are only a few….. The bleachers were MOSTLY EMPTY at the inauguration. EVEN IN THE COVERED GLASSED-IN GRANDSTAND…!!The (S)election was a sham…. as the video suggests. AS USUAL..!!The ‘fix’ was in. AS USUAL…!!The ‘LIAR-IN-CHIEF’ goes along with it…. AS USUAL..!! As the video showed.. We have a ‘MADE FOR TV’ prezzy… 🙂@ Gian FrancoI suspect the answer to your question lies in the fact that all successful revolutions  tend to be organized by the Jews. Lobro will tell you more about this. I don’t have time.Check out rise of Cromwell and Civil War in England. Set up by Jews! French Revolution. Jews behind it! Russian Revolution. Again, cherchez le Juif! Spanish Civil War. More hooked noses in plain sight! So, mass agitation is pretty much a Jewish thing. Jews specialize in protest and demolition. They are the ultimate Complainers and Whiners. In order to succeed in stirring up vast numbers of people to take to the streets, you need TWO things — and both these things the Jews have in abundance: (1) An unlimited supply of money for subversion, which is needed for bribery and corruption. (2) Complete control of the mass media (for brainwashing public).  I could add a third: mass surveillance of the population. (Needed for blackmail). The Jews have this not only through Mossad but through NASA (in US) and GCHQ (in UK) which they have infiltrated thoroughly. They also have control of the CIA and FBI and all the major think tanks and universities.Gian –The closest explanation I can give you is that most of the people who support Trump have other, more immediate, concerns.   Many of us have lots of other responsibilities, and are not the type of people you will find parading in the streets, or “filling the grandstands” (at the inauguration). (I was invited by a congressman, but did not attend, either.)
Today, for instance, I am lingering too long at my morning coffee (as I often do!), and really need to get my ass in gear for other things.  🙂Gianfranco,
normal people don’t protest, only the mentally unbalanced, maladjusted ones, whose weak, embittered minds were easily rerouted into antisocial deviance under jew’s quarterbacking, only they can be sufficiently exercised and whipped into mass freakout that leads to street protests, violence and revolution.as perennial malcontents, they are ready to hate their own group, they crave chaotic changes, they don’t care where it lands so long as they can vent their bitterness.
But of course, Der Jude cares very much and has a detailed plan on how to guide the hateful herd to his goals, the doom of goyim.
Read The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, it is all there, check the bolshevik coup whose centenary jew celebrates this fall, double check the kiev maidan and the arab spring, even back to the french revolution and you will see that the basic script needs very little modification to adapt it to the circumstances of the place and time.BUT … this time they will fail, like they ultimately failed in Russia, because there are goyim, as dedicated and smart or smarter who know how to play that game and what we are seeing is the counter-coup by the remnants of the white establishment (mentally sane faction in the CIA, the military, the FBI and the media – FOX), people who understand the principles of a military strategy and organized campaign.
The rabid beast is howling impotently, all the marching pussies and disaffected imbeciles but to no avail.
Every day, Trump is stronger not only because he is a sharp one but because he has some serious backing that can get stuff done not by frenzied premenstrual drama but by coolly letting the enemy strangle at the end of its own rope.Which is why i don’t post much anymore, if i can’t ration with some people, what is left, to hop up and down scratching my ribcage while yelling like a chimp?@ LobroWhich is why i don’t post much anymore…I advise you to post a bit more because you are genuinely missed! If all the best posters abandon ship as you have done, Lasha will have no incentive to continue with this website. She will shut it down. I know that for a fact.Maybe you ought to consider starting up or own website to replace DM when it is shut down? Have you ever thought of that?no way Ruth, a double no way.
i have no desire of running my own blog, too stressful and unrewarding in my view, and
I WILL NEVER LEAVE LASHA’S BLOG.it’s just that on the subjects of trump and russia, the lines are drawn and opinions so entrenched that there is no point: either i preach to the converted or to the easter island stoneheads.
I will on occasion say something, when there is new material but not to worry, Ruth, even when quiescent, i will hover around.
Would you want me spouting the tired old mantras ad nauseam? not my way, you know that.Lobro –“…it’s just that on the subjects of trump and russia, the lines are drawn and opinions so entrenched that there is no point: either i preach to the converted or to the easter island stoneheads.”You wrote that DM is highly viewed. Top 2%.I KNOW Alexa showed 25% of viewers get here by search-engines.There are new unconverted “stoneheads” coming in every day. They need you.Repeating the waffle recipe  is good.. 🙂@ PatTO LOBRO: “You wrote that DM is highly viewed. Top 2%.”Last time I checked DM was easily within the top 1%. I think the figure Lobro gave was that DM was in the top .02% (not 2%). This is based on the fact that there 1 billion websites in the world. As for what DM’s Alexa ranking is right now, I can’t give you an exact figure because Alexa refuses to grant me access to its figures. You now have to PAY $$$ to check their darn figures. How ridiculous!Sard –You have to pay because AMAZON bought them.And they do NOTHING for free…!! AGAIN…. follow..$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 🙂Pat,I didn’t know Amazon had bought Alexa. I wonder what they paid? Is Amazon owned by a Jew?Lobro
Nice, I feel the same way. Another prayer goes out tonight.Sard –$300 million a few years back.Jews???? You judge…Amazon Mass-Bans Dissident Materials
Hundreds of Titles Erased within a Dayhttp://codoh.com/library/document/4266/Interesting in this context is the reference by Yad Vashem and the world’s media that one reason to ask for this act of censorship was the recent “unfortunate change in climate with more-visible antisemitism” (Jerusalem Post, Feb. 23, 2017).We at Castle Hill Publishers were holding our breaths. Amazon had been criticized by the media many times before for allowing the sale of controversial material on their website, but they never censored anything that was legal. So at first, nothing happened. **But then, as if ordered to emphasize the urgency of Yad Vashem’s request, two Jewish cemeteries were vandalized, first one in Philadelphia (Feb. 27), then allegedly another one in New York (Mar. 3).Ruth,
Although I don’t post as often as I should, I will continue to post and comment on Lasha’s site as long as possible. There are some very (((dark))) and (((sinister))) forces working to suppress dissident opinion under the guise of cracking down on so called hate speech. (((They))) are now putting pressure on Amazon to curtail the sale of “holocaust denial” books. What next? Dissidents should seriously consider moving out of the anus mundi states ( Europe and North America) to freer climes, where rule by a military junta is the norm. Democracy as practised in the anus mundi states is a sham. It’s all a shameless Klepto-Plutocracy; Government of rich thieves, by rich thieves for rich thieves.Lobro……you just stay close…..take a “vacation” if needed….but, don’t stray too far…… Now, stop swinging from the chandelier and watch a good movie…. and take a nap…..Best….Redmond@GFS – O’Reilly ran a short segment a few nights ago in which Trump supporters and the cultural Marxists on the other side came to blows.  The Leftist snowflakes appeared to have Trump supporters outnumbered.  No surprise as Trump’s people have to work for a living.  But, with winter breaking soon, I look for many clashes in the spring/summer.  If the Right doesn’t show up in large numbers, the know-nothing Left will win by default.@ Gian Franco SpottiGood questions.No, the media does not hide them because they do not exist.  The reason they do not exist is rather simple.  Unarmed people protest and armed people create revolutions when the government gets way out of hand against the people. Most Trump supporters are armed and they represent the most heavily armed society in the history of mankind, a force that the government fears because they know that they will lose a confrontation with it.  The only “mass” indications of support for Trump will be at Trump’s 2020 campaign rallies like the one he had in Florida a couple of weeks ago.If the deep state succeeds in dumping Trump by whatever means, they will get what they do not want, a revolution they cannot control or survive from a spontaneous guerrilla war.The jews and their stooges, the establishment, are very nervous and it shows.It’s difficult to understand what is going on. Is it a real struggle between the zio-jews and the globalist-jews? Or a fake struggle? Is trump a jewish rebel who wants a union with the jewish putin?
Cui bono ?PAT :There’s some evidence indicating that Trump and Putin are actually cooperating in Syria, and though there’s no joint military operations, the USA and Russia are at least somwhat coordinating their respective military missions in Syria and targeting the same enemy in Syria now, unlike under Obama who supported ISIS in Syria. What say you about Trump and Putin actually cooperating with one another vis-a-vis the situation in Syria with ISIS and all the other ZOG-Deep-State-owned-and-controlled Islamic Jihadist mercenary armies? What do you say about that, Pat?Another question for you : Trump is also targeting ZOG’s Deep State Islamic Jihadists in Yemen, unlike Obama who supported ZOG’s Jihadists in Yemen. What say you about that, Pat?TROJ –I say… it has been “IN THE CARDS” 🙂 for years…. at least since 2014,Casinos wanted around the globe – even in Putin-Land –  need Trump’s help…. then go bankrupt..!!Both Putin and Trump use the Pharisee-Jew method for making “BIGGLY” profits… GAMBLING CASINOS..!! 🙂Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new law allowing the establishment of a gambling zone in Crimea and extending the Krasnodar gambling zone to Sochi, according to a statement published on the official web portal of legal information on Wednesday(July 2014).MOSCOW, July 23, 2014 (RIA Novosti) – Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new law allowing the establishment of a gambling zone in Crimea and extending the Krasnodar gambling zone to Sochi, according to a statement published on the official web portal of legal information on Wednesday.The statement says that Crimean authorities will determine the borders of the new gambling zone. The Crimean leaders already said that they will either spread gambling facilities across the peninsula, or establish a gambling zone in the south coast of Crimea, near the town of Yalta, where the majority of resorts are located.
At the same time, the borders of the Krasnodar gambling zone will now be set by the Russian government so that the territory of Sochi will be included.In Sochi, casinos will be located near the Olympic Village.Moscow banned gambling in Russia in 2009, except for special designated zones across the country. The four zones established earlier are located in Kaliningrad near the Baltic Sea, the Far East, Siberia’s Altai Region, and southern Krasnodar territory.Russian lawmakers believe that allowing gambling in Crimea will attract investors, increase the number of tourists and create new jobs.https://sputniknews.com/russia/20140723191133719-Putin-Signs-Law-Establishing-New-Gambling-Zone-in-Crimea/Lasha wrote“It is becoming increasingly clear that the ‘Deep State’ is absolutely determined to bring down Trump and replace him with a Hilary proxy.”Given the premise of Trump’s being (S)ELECTED, then this just may point to Pence as being the pre-planned Hellary proxy all along.just like i said, trump will win: Why Donald Trump will WIN against the lying mass media.
But the kabuki season’s ticket holders will never change the tune, the more advanced claim that jesus and satan are all kabuki, the world is a kabuki and they and only they are the outside spectators, they can’t go to washroom without the cries of kakabuki being heard.“You say kakabuki, I say kikebuki” by  Scholmo ShtickspeareAll the world’s a kikebuki,
And all the goys and gals merely cattle;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one Jew in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so the Jew plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans shekels. Oy Vey!Wowzers…….that’s all I can say…..Be well, my friends…..If my house was on fire, the last thing I would be worried about would be antagonizing my ostensible “enemies” that lived on the other side of town.For a man under serious domestic attack by the “deep state”, potentially even with his life at stake, Trumpster seems a little too concerned with things like stacking his administration with an eclectic mix of rabid Russophobic warmongers, for example. Here’s an embattled babe-in-the-woods president that has to look under the bed every night, but he’s not too worried about a bullet with his name on it; rather, he’s worried about Iran testing a missile, or China’s activities in the South China sea. Seriously?Anyway, he didn’t know that the NSA was out of control? He didn’t know that the “government” in general, was almost completely unaccountable? What does think the NSA does all day, play tiddlywinks? He had no clue that all they do (when they’re not downloading porn) is spy on people, being apparently answerable only to the “deep state”? I keep asking myself: Why doesn’t Trumpster get together with sheriff Joe and prosecute Obama for his fraudulent birth certificate? Trumpster’s making a big deal out of Obama spying on him, but the apparent fact that Obama is an illegal alien with a fraudulent birth certificate, whose whole “presidency” was illegitimate, doesn’t mean anything?I think I know why. But I’ll relate it by way of a story: As a kid one of my favorite TV shows was “Star Trek” (the original Star Trek). And I remember one episode where Kirk, Spock, et al. were on some planet where the people had telekinetic powers. And Dr. McCoy discovered it was due to some chemical in the water on that planet, so he figured out how to isolate the chemical, injected the landing party with it, and they also developed the same telekinetic power (only stronger than that of the natives, because McCoy gave them a big dose), with which they defeated the bad guys, and all was well with the universe again.But then a few episodes later, Kirk, Spock, et al., were in another serious jam involving some different rogue aliens, and I thought, “why don’t they use the telekinetic power they already discovered?” As a serious little kid, that really bothered me, so I asked my Mother why, and she said: “Because it’s only a show, it’s not real”, or something like that.look, i understand what you’re saying but you also must understand the limits of an EMBATTLED president’s powers.
it is easy to make potus look almighty when he is a creature of the protocols with the entire cast of senate+congress in obediently supportive role, like it was for gw and obama.
but try to do something on your own and the entire apparatus is sprung on you with every piece of legislation and many more invented “constitutional challenges” boxing you in, on top of the entrenched fifth column left by the outgoing administration who are your worse enemies than all the foreign powers put together (excluding israel, a special case).so you think that trump is turning hostile on russia, ramping up the confrontation in order to please massa jew?think again, because how is it that russians don’t see it?
maybe unlike us, russians didn’t watch jew star trek but learned the chess basics instead.once again, it is imperative that you and everyone else learns to distinguish between jew’s acting and reality of his emotions and if psychology is no help, then the trusty old CUI BONO works the best.jew will only invent fake opposition in order to undercut real opposition, which is not the case here, it has been tried and people saw through it, #occupy, MoveOn, democracy in Action, all those Sorosian pustules and warts are now ineffective and it is time for direct confrontation because there is no opposition other than christian denominated elements of old establishment on its last legs, the military, police – and they clearly see that their best allies are international, just like jew is international – the goy diaspora, Russia, Iran, China … so while the talk is pseudo-hostile ranting, the underlying message is JEW IS THE ENEMY.The one and only.pick up the cue from those who didn’t learn their reality from reality TV.Lobro –“JEW IS THE ENEMY. The one and only.”You can finally see….That means Trump’s Administration is….
…….. MOSTLY  “the one and only enemy”..!! 🙂“but try to do something on your own and the entire apparatus is sprung on you with every piece of legislation and many more invented “constitutional challenges” boxing you in, on top of the entrenched fifth column left by the outgoing administration who are your worse enemies than all the foreign powers put together (excluding israel, a special case).”Of course there was a time when I gave Trumpster the benefit of the doubt for this very reason. But as time goes on, and more and more things happen (or fail to happen) that that line of reasoning simply can not explain, the impotence theory has to be rejected; yet you still cling to it.Did they put a gun to Trump’s head and make him say things like “Russia has to return Crimea”, and “Was Obama too soft on Russia?”
http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/15/politics/trump-crimea-russia-twitter-obama/index.htmlYour theory can’t explain it, but I believe I can: Trumpster and his handlers know Crimea is a non-negotiable issue with Russia. Thus the posturing at the UN and Trump’s ridiculous statements are obviously a calculated provocation designed to burn bridges with Russia. There’s no other reasonable way to construe this.“so you think that trump is turning hostile on russia, ramping up the confrontation in order to please massa jew? think again, because how is it that russians don’t see it?
maybe unlike us, russians didn’t watch jew star trek but learned the chess basics instead.”First, no, I think the hostility toward Russia was something Trumpster planned with his Jew handlers at the very beginning of his fraudulent campaign.  Second, with regard to the link, one man (who’s apparently not even Russian himself), speaking in regard to his own personal opinion, discussing the “war” between Trump and the “media” (real or imagined), doesn’t convince me that “Russia” doesn’t see Trump’s provocations and hostile administrative appointments for what they are.“once again, it is imperative that you and everyone else learns to distinguish between jew’s acting and reality of his emotions and if psychology is no help, then the trusty old CUI BONO works the best.”From my perspective, I can say the same thing to you. I really think you’re looking at things the wrong way.“jew will only invent fake opposition in order to undercut real opposition, which is not the case here, it has been tried and people saw through it, #occupy, MoveOn, democracy in Action, all those Sorosian pustules and warts are now ineffective and it is time for direct confrontation because there is no opposition other than christian denominated elements of old establishment on its last legs, the military, police – and they clearly see that their best allies are international, just like jew is international – the goy diaspora, Russia, Iran, China … so while the talk is pseudo-hostile ranting, the underlying message is JEW IS THE ENEMY.”I’ll be the first one to say that I don’t have all the answers…and neither do you. That said, frankly I think the Jews are in a desperate situation. Their Satanic Judeo-communist “New World Order” is crumbling.
And as I mentioned in another comment, I’m not sure the status quo ante will work for them anymore. That is, the days of effectively ruling the U.S. by way of puppet presidents may have come to an end, and Trumpster may be the one selected to preside over the transition to a military dictatorship (or to nuclear war, or whatever they decide), just as Bush/Cheney were selected to preside over 9/11, for example.Harold –“…Trumpster seems a little too concerned with things like stacking his administration with an eclectic mix of rabid Russophobic warmongers..”NO RUSSIAPHOBES….!! Just greedy oligarchs… Trump’s cadre…!!RUSSIA  is the BEST ENEMY money can buy…!! “YUGE” cycle repeatedly. 🙂From Truthseeker:
“From 1917 to 1953 The Soviet Union, dominated by Jews, was treated as OUR FRIEND. In 1953 Stalin was murdered and Jews, led by Beria, began a purge of their enemies. However, General Zhukov and Kruschev struck first and executed thousands of mainly Jewish NKVD members. This change in personnel started what we knew as “The Cold War”. Suddenly the Soviet Union was OUR mortal enemy. This situation continued until the fall of the Berlin wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990. The puppet Yeltsin took over. Western banks funded oligarchs (nearly all Jewish) who bought up the newly privatised assets of the state and, Lordy, Lordy, Russia was now OUR FRIEND again. Fifteen years or so later Putin started jailing oligarchs and retrieving pirated state assets. Many of the oligarchs run for their lives into the west. Russia gets defined as a ‘Christian’ nation. The Jewish population has fallen to one in seven hundred and sixty six (0.133%) and Russia is, lo and behold, OUR ENEMY again.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0cjhN-cVdAhttp://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=148171“What does the Deep State want? Simple. They want a restitution of the status quo — with themselves in charge.”What if they’ve decided that the status quo ante won’t work anymore? Maybe they feel that their rule can only effectively continue under martial law/military dictatorship?Could they be using a contrived “Trump vs deep state” conflict to show “the people” that America is no longer governable by the constitution (sic)? Then when things get bad enough some deus ex machina will appear on the scene and restore “order” (i.e., iron-fisted rule by the deep state with no more need for such burdensome mind games)?Thank you Darkmoon.  I can’t watch; it’s all too painful.  And worse yet everyone I know is on the side that wants to take Trump down.  I don’t know how they are going to manage it but I wish Trump weren’t so naive, and that he would wake up and just start prosecuting the Hillary nexus beginning with whatever was on those e-mails that came out of the Weiner sexting bust.   But Trump is Trump.  He is a straight guy, military school graduate, a Fifties dude who goes for locker room talk and the prettiest girl he can find… He is proud that he led the Israel parade.  He hasn’t looked into the dark side of the Democratic party, or the dark side of the Jewish elite.  In some ways he is as too naive to be president.  Yet who else could take on something this vast. this sinister, this lethal than someone who really didn’t know what the heck he was doing.  So he put on his red baseball cap (like a knight putting on his armor) and he went in front of the disenfranchised and completely destroyed American people and said I am going to lead you out of this dark place.  Oh my…and here we are in the middle of it.  God help us!So…Justin Raimondo has written (as per usual) a brilliant article on the situation: “Spygate: America’s Political Police vs. Donald Trump” .  In the article he basically says that the spy network is way beyond the old wiretapping days.  Apparently Obama expanded and relaxed the spying capacity of the NSA before he left office and all the anti-Trump people had to do was to comb the available data and he gives numerous instances of this happening.Are we doomed?  I hope not.  Of course, no one in Congress or anywhere in the Justice Dept–entirely on board with it–bothered to protect us.  I think I heard this one guy out here in California but I can’t remember his name who brought it all up.  Trump has to solicit that type of person for some real help.  Trump is so straight that he can’t think the worst but he has got to start doing it and he has to do it in a less open way but behind the scenes, quit the tweeting in the wee hours of the morning.We need Trump to help us free our bureaucracy from the grip of the corporate fascists and pedophiles.  He has to think of what happens to all of us who have been shoved under the rug.  Personally, I am not sure what I will do already living in the corporate fascist state of California I know what it’s like to be powerless against multiple mandates, to be forced into buying products in order to make money for pharma, to have politicians that laugh at children who have been poisoned by vaccines and kick out mothers from the halls of government.  A new word has to be invented for what has happened in California in the time period of ten years.  It’s beyond the gulag, it’s beyond anything anyone can imagine.  Drunk as skunk politicians passing maniacal laws that stick to the books like glue.The trick for Trump to AVOID allowing Israel to draw the US into another middle east war is to preemptively partner with Putin, have Putin step in preemptively as a threat if USA joins with Israel, thereby providing Trump with “cover” to NOT step in. Russia need not do anything in actuality, just move a few pieces around the chessboard and threaten further involvement. That allows Trump/US to then argue that we want to avoid another messy middle east quagmire. (which is actually a good argument and true). Meanwhile, Putin & Trump can stay friends and do deals that benefit both countries and actually neutralize middle east tensions and false flags by IsraelisI like that scenarioCan’t stop sorry…so upset.  OK imagine a society of robotic people who are so mind controlled they are looking at their phones that predict sun and it’s raining, and they say it’s a sunny day… that’s what we have.  If the cell phone says what the weather is, then that’s what the weather is..   Imagine these same people are actually controlled through their cell phones, their every move is potentially charted and plotted.  Imagine that someone can decide they aren’t complying so their cars can be blown up from some remote computer screen–whoops kapoore is too non-compliant, she’s a good driver but her car is wired to a satellite therefore we blow her up.  Imagine a billing system run by covert means where what you buy and more importantly what you don’t buy is monitored.  Finally, imagine the most heartless, materialistic, spirit cooking pedophile sadists in charge of the network.  They drain the lifeblood of children like vampires to extent their own pathetic lives.  Please God, don’t let Trump fail.Remember the statement made by “Zuck” (Mark Zuckerberg) when discussing his stolen facebook project? Something along the lines of ‘people give me all their secrets, I don’t know why’. Do you invest in “Smart” tech? I don’t. Never Facebooked, Tweeted, prefer landline to microwave cell phone in close proximity to the brain, except for emergencies when a cell is useful – not that landlines are totally safe, but far less worse from a electromagnetic perspective. Mr. Trump and his administration move very fast, but there has been at least one campaign style rally in FLA. Secretary of Commerce Ross has successfully imposed a fine of $1 billion on a Chinese Company for violating tech sales to North Korea (his modest statement when complimented: “Don’t annualize that rate”.) Now, 47,000 employees at commerce are working on NAFTA. This process will continue with or without Mr. Trump for the next 4 years at least – provided voters continue to demand it. The Intelligence community is NOT MONOLITHIC. “They” are not all about ‘getting’ Mr. Trump. Zion Internationale (the Globalist faction) is, but even the jewish community is split between people who work for a living, have careers, meet payrolls, and so on and the creatures from la-la land – Academia, Hollywood, MSM, and the Globalist-Internationale who promote as “important” transgenderism and other created issues while they are busy stealing wholesale. Pat’s observation about the latest Wikileaks Year Zero (Vault 7) deserves further attention, the continuing attempt to delegitimize Mr. Trump is expected but is largely failing. Looking forward to the EU broken into a million pieces, hopefully soon…Ruth, Lasha and LOBRO are hard to split, just like the letters “s” and “t’ in the German language. They have a saying or a grammatical rule in German that says, ” trenn die s nicht von t, dass tut die beiden vie.” In English (don’t split the s from t, that hurt both them.) Except, the expression does rhyme  when you say it in German.vie should be Weh.Trenn das “s” nicht von dem “t”, denn das tut den beiden weh.
Rule for syllabication, let that word roll off of your tongue,  like in Ge-sta-po. 🙂weh should be Weh. Substantives are capitalized in German.Machnichts!Long time no hear. Don’t be such a stranger.Franklin,
you would be right , but there are these pesky rules and exceptions in German grammar.  “weh”  in the above context does not count as a noun.
Regel (rule) 132 of the Duden (new and expanded edition, Bibliographisches Institut  Mannheim/Wien/Zuerich 1973) says that in standing connections with verbs in which the noun exists only in a diminished meaning it is not felt as such anymore -weh tun -.“Es ist mir weh ums Herz.” Meaning “Having Weltschmerz”.
“Es ist ein staendiges Weh und Ach.” Meaning everything is always lamentable.Oh boy,  I don’t want to be a copy of Grammar Fiend, and you spell it like you want.  Macht nichts!  🙂Brownhawk,
sometimes life gets in the way. And usually I prefer to listen instead of talking.I hear ya, Machtnichtsreminds me of the old adage about why we are endowed with two ears and only one mouth!{The trap set in “THE SWAMP” being drained, caught a  “YUGE” alligator from the Obama side of the  ‘SWAMP’ to be Ambassador to RUSSIA.Trump is “DRAINING THE SWAMP”… yeah…. SURE… “BIGGLY”……. right into the Oval Office..!! 🙂Jon Meade Huntsman Jr. served as the 16th Governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009.  He was United States Ambassador to Singapore from 1992 to 1993, and China from 2009 to 2011. He has served in the “SWAMP” of five U.S. Presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. In January 2014, Huntsman was named Chairman of the Washington-based foreign policy think-tank the Atlantic Council:
https://issuu.com/atlanticcouncil/docs/pitching_guide_rw_0301_web?e=23027907/33845422Huntsman began his career in the “SWAMP” as a White House staff assistant for Ronald Reagan, and was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and United States Ambassador to Singapore by George H.W. Bush. Later as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under George W. Bush, he launched global trade negotiations in Doha in 2001…. and “BIGGLY” guided the accession of China – INTO –  the “MIRE” of the World Trade Organization…!! He also served as CEO – BOSS ALLIGATOR –  of his family-owned Huntsman Corporation and chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. In 2009, he was appointed United States Ambassador to China by Barack Obama..!!As Winston says, avoiding the  spook electronic surveillance is easy for any mildly technically orientated people – those  intent on criminality or those who consider privacy a natural right. Electronic surveillance is the psychological pen for the sheeple.If the NSA are so smart how come Vault 7 exists.The real concern is that “experts”, in this case NSA, can roll out emotional but unsubstantiated claims, picked up by the controlled media, and a new policy or action result. Society is a now just as much a theocracy, based on unfounded manipulations, as any religion.On Trump, I am with Loboro, but I can easily see how Trump is a plant, whose job is to engender chaos, to then be replaced by Pence. The evidence from Pat and others is convincing. The only crutch I have is my belief that Trump is genuine based on observation of his speeches. The strongest action Trump has taken is on the TPP and lobbying.  But these could easily be sacrificial pawns in a tactical game. We have also to consider the the anti-globalist sentiment that Trump has whipped up.In conclusion I believe Trump is fallible but genuine and caught between zionist (his kin) and globalist Tribe members.@ Flan“The only crutch I have is my belief that Trump is genuine based on observation of his speeches.”I cannot reconcile any of his actions since Jan 20 with his foreign policy speech of April 27, 2016 (and other things he said during his campaign). Therefore, I have to conclude that there was an intent to deceive. “The strongest action Trump has taken is on the TPP and lobbying. But these could easily be sacrificial pawns in a tactical game.”Exactly. His presidency seems to be the political embodiment of a “limited hangout” propaganda ploy.“We have also to consider the the anti-globalist sentiment that Trump has whipped up.”I think that has to be taken with a BIG grain of salt. As I see it, Obama and Clinton already inadvertently whipped that up. Trump came along and used his apparent “outsider” status and deceptive rhetoric to take advantage of the anti-globalist sentiment.
But what are the globalists’ biggest apparent headaches? A powerful and independent Russia, China and Iran. And what’s Trumpster’s position on Russia, China and Iran? Same as Obama’s if not more aggressive.You are right too on foreign policy.let’s hold on for a bit.raqqa is not part of russian-syrian operations yet.trump spelled out very clearly at all stages that his urgent goal was to destroy the jew caliphate (ISIS, DAESH, al Nusra and affiliates).so far, he hasn’t broken this promise.
if on the other hand, this is just in order to grab raqqa and hold it on behalf of israel against liberation by assad, that would be a true game changer towards not just assad, for whom trump expressed admiration and respect but also toward russia.
as far as i am concerned, too murky to call it play-by-play.
maybe you are right but it’s still early days.i can see global research being concerned because they have an important iranian contingent and though i am always on their side, they may be overly anxious at this point.Dear Pat, Sardonicus, Gilbert and Lobro,
I would like to thank you all for the answers you gave me.
As a matter of fact  you gave me the confirmation I was almost expecting.

ItalyIn the early part of Reagan’s 1st year in office (1981) a bullet fired from the gun of mind-controlled John Hinkley came less than a half an inch from killing him. It could be that orchestrating his death was the plan for getting Bush Sr. into the presidency, which in effect happened in spite of his survival, seeing that it was ex-CIA chief Bush who was the defacto president overseeing Iran-Contra and the dismantlement of the Soviet Union.Consider that “Uncle Ronnie” was primarily used for his Hollywood charisma in order to get (s)elected, with Bush as his running mate in position to take over. Fast forward 36 years, and perhaps with a little tweaking here and there  to ensure Trump got enough electoral votes, the same thing* is in play with VP Pence being the “point man” with a direct pipeline to those REALLY in charge – factions of the CIA dwelling under the sordid pile.  Martin Bormann meet George (Schiff) Bush meet Mike Pence?*But without the messiness of an assassination, having perfected (((their))) m.o.B-Hawk –I remember “RED RONNIE”… He was the only other divorced President.Trump has ‘Trumped’ him with TWO divorces…!!Neither were/are trustworthy…!!  🙂Yep…. I certainly DO remember him…..VERY well. He was a ‘great actor’ and liar ALL of his life. Here is a short list of what I remember. There is much more: 
I remember that HE could NOT ‘remember’ his part in the Iran-Contra drug deals….that started the drugs pouring into America. He said “I don’t remember” over 200 times. He was a ‘great actor’. Ollie North covered for him and was convicted for lying to congress, but was pardoned by his accomplice and leader.
 
 
I remember that he took the national debt from $900 billion to over $3 trillion by the time he left office. That was more than all the presidents before him …totaled up. That was the start of our debt problems we have today. He was a ‘great actor’….. liar.
 
 
I remember that ‘Red Ronnie’ was the president of the Screen Actors Guild, a communist organization, and he continued the communist movement the rest of his life. Ed Asner praised him. He was a ‘great actor’…. liar.
 
 
I remember he was a Democrat, and changed to Republican because he saw that he could not get elected as a Democrat. But, being the good actor, he could talk one way and act another, fooling most of the people that did not know what he was really doing. He was a ‘great actor’….. liar.
 
 
I remember that the Republicans of California knew his communist policies, having lived under his regime. Here is what they resolved when he ran for president the first time and was defeated because of opposition like this. He was a ‘great actor’…. liar… and they KNEW IT:

Santa Maria , California
May 4, 1975 ….BTW – I believe George(Schiff) was actually Scherff. 🙂http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_bush19.htmI remember that HE could NOT ‘remember’ his part in the Iran-Contra drug deals….that started the drugs pouring into America. He said “I don’t remember” over 200 times. He was a ‘great actor’. Ollie North covered for him and was convicted for lying to congress, but was pardoned by his accomplice and leader.Pat,Red Ronnie the Commie was a B-Actor (B-grade or 2nd rate to those not familiar with the term ‘B-Actor’). You don’t need to be a great actor or even a good actor to read the teleprompter. And as for his forgetting…. he may very well have truly forgotten. The more I look back and study him in old YouTube videos, Ronnie was showing signs of alzheimer’s even before he was shot by John Hinkley Jr. in 1981. His alzheimer’s was advanced by the time the Iran-Contra Hearings ended in 1987.JFC –“he may very well have truly forgotten”That’s a good guess.He did enough earlier on to NOT get a pass from me.. 🙂Reagan was sworn into office on Jan 20, 1981 on the WEST WING of the Capitol Building, all previous Presidents took their oath of office on the East side of the building. This was done so that Reagan would face the Washington Monument (obelisk) during his swearing in ceremony as President of the United States. Twenty years earlier Ex-Jesuit Priest Alberto Rivera informed the world that when the Jesuits had completely taken over ALL the American Christian Churches an American President would be sworn into office facing an obelisk as a sign.

This is what the russians are saying (march 9):
Turkey is increasingly uniting Syria, Kurdish forces, America and Russia against its imperial ambitionsAll of this happens as Kurdish forces have reached an accord with the Syrian Arab Army to cooperate against a common foe, Turkey and their FSA terrorist allies.Adding to the turn of events, both American and Russian forces have agreed to separate Kurdish forces from Turkish forces in eastern Syria.Turkey has increasingly backed itself into a corner. America, Russia, Syria and Kurdish forces are now lined up against Turkey, albeit each with a unique but increasingly similar goal.and of course, erdogan has come unhinged, only obeys israel’s wishes.
i think some journalist got decades in slammer for stating that erdogan is a crypto-jew – must have hit home.

No? Then it’s just another act of war from an unaccountable presidential warmonger…obviously doing Jew dirty work. Even if Trumpster’s motives are “sincere” (ROTFL!), putting U.S. forces in close proximity to Russian and Syrian forces – especially with tensions being what they are – risks a war by “accident” (e.g., false-flag attack). Trumpster’s apparently willing to risk nuclear war with Russia to show the world how tough he is with other peoples’ lives. This piece of subhuman filth masquerading as a human being is even lower than Obama.(BTW the Jews are out in force on youtube. Every “Trump exposed” video on youtube that I’ve seen so far has an army of Jews defending Trumpster in the comments).With such a mentally and morally defective, shamelessly servile Jew puppet in the White House, I can see another Jew false flag operation happening, e.g., a replay of the Jewish attack on the USS Liberty.Jew puppet LBJ has nothing on Jew puppet DJT.I can easily imagine Jews pretending to be the Syrian Army attacking Trumpster’s illegally deployed cannon fodder.In one of his last major predictions in 1945, Edgar Cayce not only saw the end of the Soviet Union, but saw Russia emerging as the hope of the world:“Through Russia comes the hope of the world. Not in respect to what is sometimes termed Communism or Bolshevism. No. But freedom, freedom! That each man will live for his fellow man. The principle has been born there. It will take years for it to be crystallized. Yet out of Russia comes again the hope of the world.”He saw Russia eventually merging in friendship with the U.S.“By what will Russia be guided? By friendship with that nation which hath even placed on its monetary unit In God We Trust”“…against a common foe, Turkey and their FSA terrorist allies.Adding to the turn of events, both American and Russian forces have agreed to separate Kurdish forces from Turkish forces in E.

This is calculated to detract from the DEEPER state “CIA” machinations (as reflected by the protocols) doing the spinning, while underneath it all it appears that the ruse of fighting “Islamic terrorism” is beginning to stagger.‘Based Stick Man’ Fights Antifa Leftists At Trump Rally, Gets Arrestedhttps://needtoknow.news/2017/03/520/Kyle Chapman, the ‘Based Stick Man,’ also known as the ‘Alt-Knight,’ was wearing a gas mask and carrying a long stick at the Berkeley March4Trump this weekend.

(filed March 12, which happens to coincide with today – Happy Purim, wahhabi jewboys)let’s distill the extraneous bullshit from this down to the simple diagram.
CIA declares war on Trump, using Putin as the proverbial but unwilling blunt object?
Ok, then Trump declares war on CIA, using Putin as the proverbial and willing blunt object.Really, you should read the whole thing but here is (almost a random) excerpt to catch the flavor:On 27 February, according to this report, the office of the Pentagon liaison to the RSII Coalition (located in the Green Zone, Baghdad, Iraq) provided to the Federation’s Aerospace Forces commander a US intelligence document detailing that the CIA had organized a secret meeting of all of their top Al-Nusra Front terror commanders to be held the following day (28 February) near Rasm al-Eis village (28 kilometers south-west of Aleppo)—and that within 26 hours of receiving this information, a single AF Su-24 fighter jet was able to target with a KAB-500 guided bomb killing at least 67 of these radical Islamic terrorists, including 19 of their top field commanders.
Astoundingly, this report continues, not only did President Trump’s Pentagon aid in the killing of these CIA-led Al-Nusra Front terrorists, America’s new leader, also, directed his US Air Force to target ISIS fighting units, tanks, storage facilities and command centers around Palmyra that resulted, yesterday, in Russian, Syrian army and Hezbollah military forces retaking this ancient city—and that the General Staff declared a decisive victory with at least 1,000 ISIS terrorists killed or wounded thus allowing the liberation of 36 settlements located in an area of 400 square kilometers.Equally as significant as President Trump’s ordering his own CIA’s Islamic terrorists in Syria targeted for destruction by Federation Aerospace Forces, this report notes, was his, also, unleashing the US military against the, likewise, CIA funded Al-Qaeda forces in Yemen that former President Obama never allowed to be attacked, much less destroyed.I told you, i told you (Trump just delivering on promises, that’s all).Lobro –GREAT..!! It’s about time…I’m glad to see you NOW LIKE US TROOPS in Syria… now Trump does it…

….. but has a long way to go yet… to demolish as much for the London Pharisee-Jew Bankers…. the financiers.There were 12,192 bombs dropped by US in Syria last year:US drops more bombs in Obama’s final year of office than in 2015The U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs last year, 3,027 more than 2015.According to an analysis of Defense Department data from the Council on Foreign Relations, a non-partisan think tank, the majority of the bombs were dropped in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. leads an international coalition fighting the Islamic State group in both countries and has carried out air operations in attempt to reduce the area controlled by the terrorist organization.Nearly the same amount of bombs were dropped in Syria (12,192) and Iraq (12,095) last year. http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article124842824.html#storylink=cpyAND…. it IS correct…“pat will be Pat will be Pat” 🙂Trumpster rescues ISIS commanders in Iraq:http://www.globalresearch.ca/protecting-the-terrorists-us-forces-come-to-the-rescue-of-isis-commanders-in-iraq/5578939Trumpster bombs the sh*t out of Yemen:https://www.antiwar.com/blog/2017/03/10/bomb-the-sht-out-of-them-trump-drones-yemen-more-in-one-week-than-obama-in-a-year/@ Lobro“Harold & everybody, get a load of this (let me pitch for a change, you be the catcher): Trump Approves Russian Airstrike That Killed CIA Terror Leaders In Syria .
(filed March 12, which happens to coincide with today – Happy Purim, wahhabi jewboys)”How do you know that Trumpster’s handlers haven’t given up on Syria (e.g. as a stepping stone to attacking Iran)? Or at least, how do you know that they haven’t given up on their previous approach to ousting Assad, which has apparently already failed? Who knows, they might have a new strategy in mind (e.g., a false-flag attack blaming the Syrian army or Iran), and thus be willing to sacrifice some of their no longer useful “assets” in return for some modicum of “credibility” in the eyes of the gullible. You should know by now that you can’t put ANYTHING past them.During his campaign – especially as per his “foreign policy speech” of April 2016 – Trumpster tried to present himself as a “non-interventionist”. Now, in my mind, non-interventionism is like vegetarianism/veganism; it’s something that sincere people do because of a firm commitment to an ethical/moral principle. Let’s say there’s a girl you want to ask out on a date, and she’s a vegan, and she won’t date anyone who’s not a vegetarian/vegan, so you pretend to be a vegan and you start dating her. You don’t really care for the vegan diet, but you force yourself to deal with it, at least when you’re with her.But then one day she visits your apartment unexpectedly and catches you eating a steak. Now, all that quinoa you forced yourself to eat in her presence was for nothing. You ate a hundred nauseating vegan meals and it all came to naught, because she understands that a real vegetarian/vegan is committed to an ethical principle, and one steak dinner is all it takes to prove that you’re a fraud.Now back to the Trumpster fraudster. Trumpster recently sent hundreds of troops into Syria without the approval of the Syrian government. Can there be a more dispositive example of where Trumpster stands on the issue of non-interventionism, diplomacy, etc.? Trumpster has thoroughly repudiated the principle of national sovereignty, minding your own business, doing unto others, etc. The self-professing vegan got caught eating a steak. Period. The end. He’s already abundantly proven that he’s not a principled person but a scheming tactician, and his whole campaign was obviously a fraud.Harold S.Simply put, Putin is managing to take some of the ISIS pawns off the grand ME chessboard, and in so doing this steers Trump and his handlers into the neutralized position he wants them… for nowAnd yes, some of the “deeper state” ISIS pawns (assets) are still in play with their accompanying pieces, but with the “Turkey piece” in no position to move, at present.Deeper state’s move, and they’ve been stymied…for now@ BrownhawkAs I see it, the Jews agenda in the Mideast may or may not be stymied at the moment, but to me the most important question is this:
Was Trumpster’s campaign a carefully planned fraud right from the beginning? Because if the answer is “yes”, then he is doing nothing in good faith and WW3 is imminent, IMO.
I believe that Trumpster is exactly the “fools rush in…” type of mentally and morally defective puppet ruler the Jews need to get the job done.The Trumpster’s trying to protect CIA torturers:http://www.activistpost.com/2017/03/the-trump-administration-is-attempting-to-block-testimony-on-cia-torture.htmlPresident Trump has invoked states secrets privilege in an effort to prevent the two psychologists who created the CIA’s torture program from testifying in court.The lawsuit against the two architects of the Central Intelligence Agency’s torture program has dragged on for nearly two years, with the CIA attempting to limit or completely block attempts to hold the creators of the program accountable.  The lawsuit faces yet another hurdle as the Trump administration has invoked “state secrets privilege” to prevent the two men accused of creating the program from testifying in court.**SO MUCH FOR DRAINING THE DAMN SWAMPS..!! Trump is a hustler… a criminal.. a LIAR…!! This IS misprision…!!“Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.”https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/4@ PatBut we’re told there’s a “war” going on between our “hero”, Trumpster, and the evil CIA. LOL!Speaking of our hero, Trumpster, he also seems to be going out of his way to ramp up tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and he apparently has plans to send thousands more troops to the Mideast; not to mention that he’s apparently ramping up the genocidal war on Yemen.I’ll be shocked if this filthy, sub-human, mass-murdering Jew puppet doesn’t start a war somewhere; perhaps multiple wars. It’s anyone’s guess where it’ll start.I plan on getting out of the U.S. before the summer, as I just can’t take living in this Satanic Judeo-communist dictatorship anymore. I hope Trumpster fraudster doesn’t bring the missiles before then.Deep State???? No problem. Here is the ‘Shallow State’ in full view…. 🙂ALL ‘Shallow State’ puppets and National Leaders ARE LIARS..!!

By Eric Striker
We all know Jews operate on a wild battery of double standards that they try to keep a jealous secret, and when a brave soul dares point them out, they threaten and attack them. There used to be a whole industry of political commentary dedicated to covering for this double standard, called “Conservatism,” but it is waning after the Jew Neo-Cons put all their chips on Hillary and blew their credibility.It’s impossible to make billions in Manhattan real estate without an intuitive understanding of the Jew and his odious psychology. I’m not saying Donald Trump hates every individual Jew, but he definitely knows how dangerous Jews are when they get together in a group, and without a doubt notices that their impact on our country and the world is detrimental.For the less savvy, Trump’s meeting with Netanyahu makes him a cuck, but there was a subtle troll at this event that brought bat ears to attention across the political spectrum.Reuters:Donald Trump said today that he was open to a “one-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, appearing to casually back away from a decades-long US commitment to supporting a separate Palestinian state alongside Israel.Speaking alongside Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of their first meeting at the White House, Mr Trump was asked if he supported a two-state solution or a one state-solution to the long-running conflict.“I’m looking at two-state and at one-state and I like the one that both parties like,” Mr Trump said.“I can live with either one. I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two but honestly if [Mr Netanyahu] and if the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I’m happy with the one they like the best.”Mr Trump’s openness to a one-state solution is a break from the policies of Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton, all of whom tried to broker a peace deal that would lead to the creation of two separate states.Terms like “Two-State Solution” and “One-State Solution” to the Israel-Palestine conflict are abstract-sounding; this language is used purposefully, so that you don’t know what they’re talking about. The two-state solution, which is what American politicians are paid to support, is a plan to deport Israel’s indigenous Arab population to a Palestinian state, and create a racially homogeneous Zionist country.Trump’s little off-the-cuff remark about a “one-state solution” is something which Jews are angered at the mere mention of. A one state solution would mean Israel absorbs the Palestinian territories and integrates the Arab population as fully-protected legal citizens. In such a scenario, the Arab population would outnumber Jews about 3 to 2.What’s wrong with the one state solution? Aren’t Jews the most tolerant, open minded and cosmopolitan people to ever live? Why does diversity work everywhere in the West but not in Israel?Every last Jewish and Zionist institution supports a “one-state solution” for white countries, and their genocide organs (the media, academia, finance) constantly stress how beautiful it is that whites will be outnumbered and outvoted by non-whites in the near future.In fact, when white nationalists and black nationalists want to discuss the prospect of a desperately needed two-state solution in America, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League call it “hate” and put them on a targeted-harassment list. Yet, these same Zionist groups believe anyone calling for an American-style racially pluralistic democracy in Israel is also “hate”!The Right of ReturnTypically, Jewish racists pretending to be hippy-citizens of the world have evaded direct rebuttals of exactly why they don’t want to share a country with non-Jews by claiming that the Palestinians don’t want it either. This is a lie bolstered by cooked up polls. The two dominant Palestinian parties, Hamas and Fatah, both have the Palestinian “Right of Return” as dominant aspects of their platforms. The right of return is the assertion that Palestinians who were ethnically cleansed from Israel in 1948 and 1967 have a right to move back into the homes and properties they once owned and were never compensated for.There is a much stronger legal and ethical case for this claim than there is for the “Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society” assertion that endless millions of random non-whites in other countries are entitled to live in America on our tax dollars and social services because of a poem written by some other Jew about the Statue of Liberty.The belief in the right of return is so strong among Palestinians, that Fatah arguably lost the last election over taking bribes in support of a no strings attached “two-state solution.” In recent years, they have gone back to supporting this important plank. Hamas’ principled stance to refuse to negotiate until Palestinians going back to homes they have deeds to in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, etc. is on the table, as well as being able to equally access Muslim holy sites in Israeli territory, is the basis from which cuckservatives and Zionists attack them as “refusing to recognize the Jewish state.”The Jew Unmasked
Netanyahu knew to play it cool while next to Trump, but his agent behind the scenes, Commissioner Gordonberg, beamed the spotlight. Ratmen got the signal.Some Jews, like Alan Dershowitz, interpreted (or tried explaining away) Trump’s remarks as a ploy to attack Palestinians and so supported it. A minority of Jews saw it as an endorsement of South African style Apartheid and applauded his comment, but I don’t think this is what Trump intended at all.Trump’s brilliance here is that at the same time he is being barraged by organized Jewry for his immigration restrictions, he has simultaneously forced them to go around talking about how Israel must be kept racially Jewish at all costs. It isn’t just rabid Kahanists who are reacting, but also high profile liberal Jews, writing for hard Left publications, being forced to awkwardly attack Trump for suggesting maybe a “diverse” Israel is an option, while the related headlines around their article call him “racist” for banning Somalis.Here are some examples from some very anti-Trump, anti-white, pro-mass immigration publications that support my theory. Some reactions are more extreme and kneejerk, while others are more surgical.The Atlantic, by (((Adam Chandler))):Though increasingly diminished and undermined, the two-state solution has endured since then—through the assassination of an Israeli prime minister, an intifada, the Israeli disengagement from Gaza, and three subsequent wars. In some of his final remarks as secretary of state in December, John Kerry made an urgent plea for the survival of the idea. “Here is a fundamental reality: if the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic—it cannot be both—and it won’t ever really be at peace. Moreover, the Palestinians will never fully realize their vast potential in a homeland of their own with a one state solution.”Nevertheless, after decades of American diplomacy, jockeying, and cajoling, the two-state imperative did not survive a four-question press conference with President Donald Trump. And, in its place, there are still no other alternatives.What about diversity and inclusion Adam? Last December, this brazen Jew wrote a fawning article on his fellow Jews working as immigration lawyers heroically defying Donald Trump, overtly implying that there are no alternatives but to make America brown. But for Israel, there are “no alternatives” but to keep Israel a majority Jewish Talmudic-authoritarian country.The New York Times, Editorial Board statement:President Trump came forward with a nonsensical statement on Wednesday as he dangerously backed away from the two-state solution, which has been central to America’s Mideast policy for more than 20 years and remains the only just answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.…Mr. Trump voiced optimism about getting a “great peace deal” between Israel and its neighbors. While Mr. Trump did urge Mr. Netanyahu to “hold back” on settlements in the West Bank and said Israel must make compromises, he offered no details on any peace initiative, and the vagueness of his remarks suggests he has no inkling of how to move forward. His willingness, however, to lend credence to those who would deny a separate state to the Palestinians will certainly make peace harder to achieve. Palestinians have long sought their own state and are sure to reject the idea of having their lands annexed by Israel, even if offered some kind of limited autonomy.How many Palestinians are on the New York Times editorial board? Yet this Jew fake news portal once again claims to speak in their name.Meanwhile, the actual  Palestinians at Electronic Intifada liked Trump’s statement.Electronic Intifada:Advocates of a two-state solution, including the previous US administration and European governments, see it as the only way to rescue Israel as a racist state that ensures its Jewish demographic majority through a battery of racist laws – a situation they refer to as “peace.”The New York Times of course doesn’t agree with Palestinians that Israel is also their country. They are the natives, and had a functioning and sophisticated state before Jews began flooding into it. They have a right to be there, unlike millions of Oaxaca Mexicans Jews transplanted into California.Jerusalem Post:According to J street, Trump’s statement that was “both meaningless and dangerous” and essentially “removed the anchor that has steadied and stabilized US policy toward the region”.“How can there be a negotiation, let alone an agreement, when there is no longer a consensus on what the end goal should be?,” they said. “To be clear, there is no one-state configuration that leads to peace. There is no resolution to this conflict without full political rights and independence for both peoples.”The organization added that “all so-called ‘one-state solutions’ are recipes for more violence that will ultimately threaten Israel’s identity as a democracy and a Jewish homeland” and that the two leaders “seemed detached from reality”.They added that President Trump’s vagueness on this issue will likely dismay key allies of the US in the Arab world and will embolden extremists within Israel, among Palestinians and throughout the region.J Street is considered a “liberal” Zionist group with a special place in their heart for Palestinians. Except when Trump talks about them having to share a country with these indigenous people, then the real Jew explodes out of their chest like a scene from John Carpenter’s The Thing.This reaction from the (((Congressional Democrats))) speaks for itself.Al Monitor:Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, called Trump’s comments “shameful” and “short-sighted.” Last year, she spearheaded a letter to then-President Barack Obama signed by 394 House members — 90% of the entire chamber — reaffirming Congress’ support for a two-state solution.“A two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians is the only means to ensure Israel’s long-term security and enable Palestinian aspirations for their own state,” she said in a statement Feb. 15. “That is why presidents from both parties, the vast majorities of the House and Senate, and the American people have consistently supported this objective, and why President Trump must as well.”The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs committee, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., agreed on the substance.”The alternatives to a two-state solution would mean that Israel would have to choose between its commitment to democracy and the solemn obligation to be a homeland for the Jewish people,” he said in a statement. “The parties must come back to the negotiating table to find a mutually agreed-upon solution.”The top Democrat on the committee’s Middle East panel, Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., shared similar thoughts.“The goal of this process must continue to be two states for two peoples living side by side in peace and security — a Jewish democratic state of Israel and a demilitarized Palestinian state,” he said in a statement.Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., told Al-Monitor that Trump “doesn’t really understand the issues.” Earlier in the day Nadler tweeted out an April 2015 letter from Netanyahu in which the prime minister wrote him that he remained “committed to a sustainable two-state solution.”“Certain things are very clear. You have to have a two-state solution, because you’re going to get no other solution,” Nadler said. “A one-state solution just means you’re going to try to impose your will on the Palestinians, and that’s a formula for war eventually, or you have a binational state, which has never worked in the Middle East, which is never going to work, and the dream of Zionism for 2,000 years for a Jewish state goes up in smoke.“Vox, by (((Sarah Wildman))):By abandoning an American-led, negotiated two-state solution, Trump is essentially giving up on the idea of there ever being a real, internationally recognized sovereign Palestinian state. Many Israelis and Palestinians believe that outcome would not only destroy any hope for peace between the two sides, leading to years of violence. They believe it could fundamentally alter, if not destroy, the Jewish and democratic state of Israel as we know it…In part that is because of demographics: Absorbing the Palestinian population would eventually result in there being more Palestinians than Jews in the country. To maintain a democratic state, with equal rights for all people, Israel would have to cede its Jewish character. The alternative is undemocratic — giving Palestinians unequal rights and treating them as second-class citizens.I’ve written extensively about the extreme anti-white vitriol published by Vox. Predictably, it’s run entirely by Jews who get fat Wall Street investments.Huffington Post, by (((David Harris))):In the end, however fraught with difficulty the two-state path might be, the one-state alternative is even more menacing because it is simply not sustainable. Sooner or later, it would sound the death knell for Zionism as we know it. Hence the concern about President Trump’s comment, even if this is surely not what he intended.Why would a few million Palestinians be the “death knell of Zionism,” since nations are nothing but passports and a set of values? That’s the kind of thinking Jews forcefully impose on everyone else!The quotes in this article are only the tip of the iceberg. There are literally dozens of high profile media Jews who oppose any immigration restriction in America who are furious about Trump’s comment.The Jew Harris, whose gang of international vermin at the American Jewish Committee personally went to Greece to get Golden Dawn thrown in jail, is an egregious hypocrite to say the least.Some people think that pointing out Jewish double-standards is a fruitless endeavor, and it is – but only when you’re trying to point them out to Jews. Of course, trying to play that “I’m a White Zionist” game to get Jews off your back is pointless (although it can lead to some mildly effective moments if non-Jews are watching).But in the end, National Socialists are distinct from Zionist Jews. National Socialists accept that all races have a right to their living space. We do not endorse driving natives out of their land, whether it’s the people of Tibet, the Palestinians or the Germans in Germany.But Israel isn’t Jewish land, and looking at the reaction from Left-wing Jews at what is essentially a very mild comment (he didn’t even say it would be US policy), Trump has stumbled upon a gaslighting gold mine.For whites, people who live by double-standards are viscerally offensive. If you show the average white person that organized Jewry is behind every unpopular immigration project in the West while at the same time holding virulently racist views in the only country they have loyalty to, it will resonate.With a bigger audience than ever, renew that prescription of red pills on this topic. It didn’t work before because nobody was listening. They’re listening now.








Billionaire George Soros—who works hard to portray himself as just a well-meaning philanthropist—was utterly exposed after a massive batch of leaked emails uncovered the truth.

(INTELLIHUB) In a ballsy move for a mainstream news anchor, Fox News’ Sean Hannity delivered the home run we’ve all been waiting for on the Sean Hannity Show Tuesday night when he gave much-needed publicity to Hillary Clinton’s Russian State ties to Uranium One which I first reported on back in January of 2016 in an Intellihub Magazine article titled “Clinton Foundation took massive payoffs, promised Hammond Ranch and other publicly owned lands to Russians along with one-fifth of our uranium ore.”The issue resurfaced in the media Tuesday after President Donald Trump acknowledged the little-known scandal on Twitter.“Why doesn’t Fake News talk about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia to Clinton – sale of Uranium?,” the President tweeted.Why doesn't Fake News talk about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia to Clinton – sale of  Uranium?— Donald J.

Oh, to be young and stupid again.  Let’s face it, we all were at some point, and had no idea.  Eventually, though, we grew out of it, usually recognizing that there really is something to be learned from our elders.  (Usually.  Not always.)  The problem with the typical millennial is that they don’t realize that is a condition of every generation prior to their gaining three decades of experience of life on the planet. (By that time, if you don’t know that you don’t know jack, you’re probably a professor on a college campus.)Take the special snowflake who actually agreed to be interviewed by Tucker Carlson on his show Wednesday.  This millennial…well, doesn’t know what he doesn’t know.  Watch:Schools are now teaching that anyone from around the world has a right to come here to work, and always has?  Ellis Island doesn’t ring a bell, where newcomers were herded through the immigration lines, documented often with names misspelled, and then quarantined for months to be sure no disease was imported?  I hate to be the bearer of bad news to this little darling, but relatives of some ancestors got sent back to their countries of origin due to disease.  The people at the front of the line in those days were usually skilled labor.  In this writer’s family, even the skilled labor people had every intention of returning to the old country until there was a revolution.  They came here to find work, not draw a dole.LEGALLY.And that is the sticking point that Tucker tried to impress on this special snowflake.  If immigration law is ignored simply due to the low skill sets of the illegals coming into the country, why should ANY laws be obeyed?  The reality is that in the 19th century, this writer’s ancestors came to this side of the pond, some via Canada, to avoid starvation.  Others came due to the plentiful farmland.  Later, when zinc smelting needed workers, yet more emigrated.  All were hated in their time mostly due to being Catholic, and came in under quota systems.  But still, this was all legal.It is a sad truth that many illegals are here due to no fault of their own.  At the same time, it is not fair to those who have gone the legal route for someone to just come to this nation and expect all the same rights and privileges as a citizen.  That’s what Tucker tried to tell this young man, and what he stubbornly refused to see.

At JPMorgan Chase & Co., a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours.The program, called COIN, for Contract Intelligence, does the mind-numbing job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went online in June, consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation.While the financial industry has long touted its technological innovations, a new era of automation is now in overdrive as cheap computing power converges with fears of losing customers to startups. Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for the biggest U.S. bank. The firm recently set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue, while reducing expenses and risks.read more:  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance








A Russian high school student who became the face of defiance amid anti-Kremlin protests on Sunday is the son of an ally of President Vladimir Putin.Roman Shingarkin’s father, Maxim Shingarkin, is a former member of parliament and was a member of the LDPR party, a nationalist party that supports Putin on almost all major issues.During Sunday’s protest in Moscow against what organizers claim was official corruption, 17-year-old Shingarkin and another teen climbed to the top of a lamp post in Pushkin Square.A police officer dressed in riot gear scaled the lamp post and attempted to get the teens to come down as the crowd of protesters cheered and whistled. They young men refused, and the police officer retreated, further exciting demonstrators at the biggest protest in Russian in several years.Through images posted on social media, Shingarkin’s sit-in on top of the lamp post was embraced by Kremlin opponents as a David-and-Goliath act of defiance.After the demonstrators had dispersed, police persuaded Shingarkin to come down, and he was detained. Police took him to a police station where he could not be charged because of his status as a minor. He was taken to a police station but, as a minor, he could not be charged. The teen had to call his father to pick him up.Shingarkin’s father was unaware that his son had been participating in the protest.“When I rang my dad from the police station, he immediately understood why I was there,” Shingarkin said in an interview with Reuters TV.“I went there (to the rally) out of interest to see how strong the opposition is, how many people would take to the streets, and at the same time to get a response from authorities to a clear fact of corruption.”He claimed that he climbed the lamp post because he “could see nothing from the ground”.When reached by telephone on Wednesday, the elder Shingarkin said he was sympathetic with his son’s motives for attending the demonstration.“He has a social position, against corruption, I support it completely,” Maxim Shingarkin said. He also emphasized that his son’s actions were no indication that he or the family opposed Putin.Maxim Shingarkin contended that Putin is popular among voters and there is no one to replace him, but the officials around him let him down.Roman Shingarkin noted that he would not participate in future protests unless they were sanctioned by the government. He said that he might attend a non-approved demonstration once he turns 18, claiming that if he gets arrested then, the police will charge him and not involve his parents.H/T: Reuters  Sign up to get breaking news alerts from Dennis Michael Lynch.











Riad (Archiv) - Über eine Milliarde Menschen nutzen WhatsApp – doch im erzkonservativen Saudi-Arabien bekommt der US-Kurznachrichtendienst nun Ärger. Der Großmufti des saudischen Königreichs hat in einer Fatwa beschlossen, dass unverhüllte Emojis gegen die eigene strenge Auslegung des Islam verstoßen und ab sofort verschleiert werden müssen.

"Da sich nicht eindeutig erkennen lässt, ob Emojis Männer oder eben doch womöglich glatzköpfige Frauen darstellen, müssen sicherheitshalber alle verschleiert werden", erklärt ein Sprecher von Großmufti ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn ʿAbdallāh Āl asch-Schaich, während er zu Demonstrationszwecken einen zwei Meter großen Zwinkersmile aus Karton mit einem in Saudi-Arabien üblichen Nikab verhüllt. 
Die Rechtsabteilung von WhatsApp versuchte zwar noch zu intervenieren und argumentierte, die körperlosen Emojis seien im Prinzip auch als enthauptete Köpfe ohne Rumpf zu deuten und somit perfekt geeignet für die Kommunikation im arabischen Raum. Doch der Großmufti blieb hart. Inzwischen hat die Regierung auch weitere Firmen, darunter Twitter, Samsung, Google (Android) und Apple, aufgefordert, ihre Emojis anzupassen. 
Bei WhatsApp ist man stolz darauf, die saudischen Auflagen in Rekordzeit erfüllt zu haben: "Ab sofort werden alle Emotionen nur noch über die Augen ausgedrückt", erklärt ein Designer der Firma. "Damit können wir speziell für arabische Frauen bis zu 50 verschiedene Arten von Schmerz, Angst und Unterdrückung darstellen." Zusätzlich zu den verschleierten Emojis wurden auch noch weitere Symbole neu entworfen – etwa eine abgehackte Hand mit dem Daumen nach oben sowie eine abgehackte Hand mit dem Daumen nach unten. Eindeutig als männlich identifizierbare Emojis wie 👨, 🎅 und 🍌 blieben dagegen unverändert. 
Immer wieder sind in Saudi-Arabien das Internet oder einzelne Computerprogramme von der islamischen Zensur betroffen. Ein Paradebeispiel ist bis heute der Spielklassiker "Tomb Raider". Die saudi-arabische Variante setzte sich am Markt nie durch – kaum ein Spieler konnte den ersten Level meistern, da Lara Croft beim Laufen ständig über ihre Ganzkörper-Verschleierung stolperte.

Spotted in Pahranagat Valley, Lincoln County, Nevada on Highway 93 (the Extraterrestrial Highway). Strange shape, huh! Wonder where it's going?For those who believe that extraterrestrials visit us, few places in the world are as attractive as the remote Nevada desert in the United States. In recent decades, there have been reports of several witnesses claiming to have seen unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in that region.For many, the alleged spacecraft are just planes that take off and land on a huge military base in the desert. But this explanation does not convince everyone. To attract more visitors to the site, the authorities decided in 1996 to name state Highway 375 - which runs from north to south to Lincoln County - from the "aliens road."According to tourism officials in Nevada, nowhere else in the country are there any more reports of sightings of extraterrestrial ships than on this 100-mile road, located just outside the mysterious Area 51 military base - two and a half hours north Of Las Vegas.

 It stands within reason to expect those receiving government welfare to be upstanding citizens and to contribute to society despite their low economic standing.Sadly, that hasn’t always been the case in the United States. But now that Donald Trump is president, things have changed. The Department of Agriculture this week announced a change in the way that food stamps or now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan (SNAP) will be doled out.The Department will now start being stricter about who is eligible for the program. The eligibility guidelines were updated three years ago, but have not been implemented up to date.Section 4008 of the 2014 Farm Bill denied benefits to two groups: Those “convicted of federal aggravated sexual abuse, murder, sexual exploitation and abuse of children, sexual assault, or similar offenses under state laws, as well as those who are not in compliance with the terms of their sentence or parole or are fleeing felons, from receiving food stamps.”Since 2014, these rules have not been enforced — but now Trump has ordered the Department of Agriculture to start enforcing them strictly.The move is the fulfillment of Trump’s promise to scale back the nearly 43 million Americans on SNAP, which is expected to cost taxpayers $45 billion this coming fiscal year.H/T TruthmonitorNow that Trump is in office, law and order has returned.Do you think Trump is doing a good job?

By Maayan LubellJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expected to sign off on Thursday on building the first new settlement in the occupied West Bank for two decades, even as he negotiates with Washington on a possible curb on settlement activity.Netanyahu was due to convene his security cabinet later in the day to approve the new enclave, government officials said."I made a promise that we would establish a new settlement," Netanyahu told reporters. "We will keep it today. There are a few hours until then and you will get all the details."He made the pledge in the run-up to the eviction in February of 40 families from the West Bank settlement of Amona. Israel's Supreme Court said the dwellings had to be razed because they were built illegally on privately owned Palestinian land.Israel and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump are in discussions on limiting the construction of settlements, which are built on land Palestinians seek for a state.Such settlements, in territory that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, are deemed illegal by most of the world. Israel cites biblical, historical and political links to the land, as well as security interests, to defend its actions.Establishing a new settlement could be a way for Netanyahu to appease far-right members of his coalition government who are likely to object to any concessions to U.S. demands for restraints on building.Trump, who had been widely seen in Israel as sympathetic toward settlements, appeared to surprise Netanyahu during a White House visit last month when he urged him to "hold back on settlements for a little bit".The two then agreed that their aides would try to work out a compromise on how much Israel can build and where.Trump's Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, this week wrapped up a second trip to the region aimed at reviving Middle East peace talks that collapsed in 2014.A new settlement would be the first built in the West Bank since 1999. About 400,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank which is also home to 2.8 million Palestinians. Another 200,000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem.Palestinians want the West Bank and East Jerusalem for their own state, along with the Gaza Strip.(This version of the story was refiled to remove extra words in paragraph 7)(Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Louise Ireland)

Working in a morgue and being surrounded by corpses sure is freaky, especially if you have an incredibly fertile imagination. It wouldn’t be surprising if visions of ghosts and the dead coming back to life constantly haunt you. However, some say that if you get used to it, all those scary thoughts eventually go away.But what if you get too used to working in a morgue and you get too comfortable with dead bodies, and so you begin to think of them in an erotic way? Okay people, make way for necrophilia.Necrophilia has existed centuries ago, as evidenced by written texts from ancient Egypt and artifacts from other ancient civilizations. It begins when one develops sexual attraction with a corpse, and then feels the need to act on such sexual urges. In 1989, psychiatrists Jonathan Rosman and Philip Resnick found out that the primary motivation for it is the idea of possessing a partner who does not resist nor reject them.Such thoughts may have crossed the mind of one female mortician named Felicity Marmaduke who worked at a morgue in Lexington, Missouri. She was a diligent worker and a pleasant colleague, according to others.One time, during a late shift, Marmaduke set eyes on an attractive dead male body. So, she washed the corpse on the examination table.If you think that this story is too terrible or too ridiculous to be true, then be happy that you’re right. This is one of those fake stories that circulate on the internet and that has long been debunked.Just imagine how sick this story would be if it was real.corpsedeadmorguemorticiannecrophiliapregnantSee moreNurse.

Please share and comment if you support Trump’s picks. Former Governor, and now Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, is being sued by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.washingtonexaminer.com reports: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Wednesday sued energy secretary and two-term Texas Gov. Rick Perry for not moving ahead with the Yucca Mountain waste repository site in Nevada, one day before the White House issued its budget blueprint suggesting the president wants to restore funding for the project. The lawsuit, filed in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, seeks to force an up-or-down vote on the project to avoid input from Nevada on permit approval for the site. “The Obama administration ignored congressional requirements, withdrew funding from the Yucca Mountain licensing process, and formed an unlawful Blue Ribbon Commission to identify alternative methods of nuclear waste storage,” according to a statement from Paxton’s office issued Wednesday. 










Today Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met with leaders from the nation’s top historically black universities to discuss funding and federal support needed for HBCU’s. The Seattle Times reports:The nation’s historically black colleges and universities are pushing for President Donald Trump to set aside more federal contracts and grants for their schools, and take a greater hand in their welfare by moving responsibility for a key program for those colleges to the White House.The college presidents, as well as the United Negro College Fund, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and other HBCU advocates, planned to express their support for migrating the White House Initiative on HBCUs from the Education Department to the White House itself. Such a move would give the initiative “greater impact for our institutions,” said Johnny Taylor, head of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a nonprofit organization which has supported public historically black colleges and universities since 1987.“Anything that the Trump administration could do to channel more federal dollars in form of grants and contracts to and through the HBCUs would really benefit our institutions and in many cases, our communities, as well,” said Mickey L. Burnim, president of Bowie State University, in Bowie, Md.Despite this very important meeting regarding the concerns HBCU leaders have, Kellyanne sat comfortably on a couch in the Oval Office, entertaining herself on her cell phone, giving the impression that what was being discussed had no importance to her.








CONCORD, New Hampshire – Chester Miller, who has been studying the effects of global warming for nearly 20 years, says that he has finally found conclusive proof that the phenomenon is completely and totally bogus.“I have been looking into the effects of global warming, and can conclusively say that the world is not warmer at all,” said Miller. “I had been waiting and waiting for this discovery, and it came to me earlier this week. It was a true moment of glory for all of science.”Miller says that during the night between Thursday and Friday, his town of Concord, New Hampshire received a massive amount of snow – over a foot in just a few hours. This, he says, is proof that the world is not getting warmer.“If global warming were real, then how come we got 14″ of snow the other night?” asked Miller. “I assume you all understand that in order for it to snow, it has to be cold. And in order for it to snow THAT MUCH in that amount of time, well – it has to be very cold. I believe I can rest my case.”

Last year, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick made headlines when he repeatedly refused to stand for the national anthem before his football games, saying that he was doing this because the U.S. is a “racist” country.Now, one year later, Kaepernick has found himself a free agent after being dropped by the 49ers. Unfortunately for him, insiders are saying that his anti-American, race-baiting antics have made it unlikely that any other team will sign him.The Blaze reported that NFL Sports Agent Eugene Lee said this week that Kaepernick is not a free agent because of his playing ability, but rather because of his attitude and his distracting protests. When asked if it was fair for teams not to hire Kaepernick due to his protests, Lee pointed out that teams are private organizations and are responsive to their customers and any potential backlash they might face for signing Kaepernick.“If you look at it from the outside looking in, I mean that’s what it appears like,” Lee admitted. “I think the situation right now with Colin is that he’s without a job, and I saw an analysis saying that part of it is due to his playing ability, but if you look around the league right now, you see some of these free agent quarterbacks that are being signed with deals, there is absolutely no way that it relates solely to his playing ability.”Lee also said he has some issues with Kaepernick personally, as he feels the quarterback had no interest in helping the black community when he was at the height of his popularity. However, now that he’s having trouble finding a new job, he has a new-found desire to help.SHARE this story if you think Kaepernick is getting the karma he deserves!source : www.truthmonitor.com comments








The Seattle Seahawks will become the first NFL team to join Colin Kaepernick’s silent protest during the national anthem this Sunday.In their home opener against the Miami Dolphins, the Seattle Seahawks have planned a “big surprise” during the national anthem, according to starting linebacker Bobby Wagner. Wagner emphasized that the entire roster will take part in the protest, though he didn’t specify if the team would sit or kneel.“Anything we want to do, it’s not going to be individual. It’s going to be a team thing. That’s what the world needs to see. The world needs to see people coming together versus being individuals,” Wagner told the Seattle Times.The team has the support of head coach Pete Carroll, who recently stood up for cornerback Jeremy Lane when he sat during the national anthem in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last Thursday before Seattle’s final preseason game against the Oakland Raiders.“[Lane]’s pretty clear on what he did and what he was trying to express and I think it is very simple and so we’ll leave that up to him,” Carroll told the Times.In addition to Lane and Wagner, starting wide receiver Doug Baldwin has publicly expressed support for Kaepernick on social media. After Kaepernick started receiving blowback for refusing to stand up for the national anthem, Baldwin defended the protest and cast Kaepernick’s critics as ignorant of what free speech entails.We honor those who fight for our right to freedom of speech and then condemn those who exercise that right?— Doug Baldwin Jr (@DougBaldwinJr) September 2, 2016Don’t tell me you just disagree with the methods.

		 * "When a child has been recruited, transported, harbored, or received and some commercial element is introduced in the production of child pornography, then that individual has also engaged in child trafficking. Whether they work in strip clubs or sweatshops, these boys and girls are victims of human trafficking."* The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) defines “severe forms of trafficking in persons” as: sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age." * "The economic reality is that human trafficking is driven by profits. If nobody paid for sex, sex trafficking would not exist."Child trafficking victims, whether for labor, sex or organ trafficking, come from all backgrounds, include both boys and girls. They span a wide age range from 1 to 18 years old. Sex trafficking victims up to roughly 25 years old most often started as young as 14. Children are trafficked out of, or into the United States from all regions of the world and represent a variety of different races, ethnic groups and religions. They may be brought to the U.S. legally or smuggled in.Trafficked children can be lured to the U.S. through the promise of school or work and promised the opportunity to send money back to their families. Children are also vulnerable to kidnappers, pimps, and professional brokers. Some children are even sold to traffickers by their families, who may or may not have an understanding of what will happen to the child. U.S. born children are also trafficked within the U.S., coming from any racial group, socio-economic background, and come from or trafficked within both city and rural areas.Update: In 2012 the (UNODC) United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reports the percentage of child victims had risen in a 3 year span from 20 per cent to 27 per cent. Of every three child victims, two are girls and one is a boy.Gender and age profile of victims detected globally: 59% Women - 14% Men - 17% Girls and 10% were Boys.Click to read the Needs of Rescued Trafficking Victims The largest group of at-risk children are runaway, thrown away, or homeless American children who use survival sex to acquire food, shelter, clothing, and other things needed to survive on America's streets. According to the National Runaway Switchboard  1.3 million runaway and homeless youth live on America's streets every day. [5,000 die each year] It would not be surprising to learn that the number of children trafficked in the United States is actually much higher than 300,000.Children are often targeted by traffickers as they are deemed easier to manipulate than adults. More money can be earned by younger girls and boys exploited in sexual exploitation, especially virgins. Pre-pubescent girls are reported to be injected with hormones to bring on puberty. Younger girls are expected to have a greater earning potential, and as such are in greater demand. Click to read about Ark of Hope's planned Harbourage Safe Homes for Child Trafficking VictimsDemand for cheap labor and for prostituted women, girls, and boys is the primary "pull" factor. Common push and pull factors exploited by traffickers include:Sex buyers are far more complicit in the victimization of sex trafficking victims. Sex tourism and child pornography have become worldwide industries, facilitated by technologies such as the Internet, which vastly expand the choices available to pedophiles and permit instant and nearly undetectable transactions.  Click to read the Needs of Rescued Trafficking VictimsMany youth, especially U.S. citizen children trafficked within the U.S., run away from problems at home and may be exploited as a result of emotional vulnerability, homelessness and the need to survive. Youth who run away from home and engage in "survival sex" often find themselves vulnerable to pimps and traffickers involved in prostitution networks. Approximately 55% of street girls, and a good percentage of boys, engage in formal prostitution and some think it is much higher than that. This means that a child client who has been homeless or living on the street for any amount of time has a great likelihood of having been sexually exploited or trafficked.The sexual exploitation of children is not limited to particular racial, ethnic or socioeconomic groups, although children from poor families appear to be at somewhat higher risk of commercial sexual exploitation. In fact, most of the street children encountered in the study were Caucasian youths who had run away from middle-class families. One clear theme is the is proportionate number of street youth who have histories of recurrent physical or sexual abuse at home and took to the streets in a desperate effort to bring their abuse to an end.According to these researchers, child sexual exploitation in the United States affects as many boys as girls, but boys are less well-served by social service and law enforcement systems because of the widespread belief that boys are better able than girls to fend for themselves. Without intervention, research has shown many boys shift from being victims of sexual abuse to victimizing other boys and girls as pimps and traffickers.People are recruited in several different ways such as through fake employment agencies, acquaintances, newspaper ads, front businesses, word of mouth or abduction. Traffickers may be neighbors, friends, returnees, agricultural operators, owners of small businesses, diplomats and even families. Increasingly, however, the traffickers are organized crime syndicates, often in collaboration with corrupt law enforcement entities, government officials or employers, who may use several intermediaries from the first point of contact to the final destination of the victim. If the victim is transported, they use both legal and illegal means of transport and various techniques to keep their victim enslaved.They may keep them under lock and key or in isolation from the public and from their family members or support networks, confiscate their passports or identification documents, use the threat of violence against the enslaved person or their families, threaten them with shame, fear of imprisonment or deportation, and control their money.The psychological effects of torture are helplessness, shame and humiliation, shock, denial and disbelief, disorientation and confusion, and anxiety disorders including post traumatic stress disorder, phobias, panic attacks and depression. Victims may experience Traumatic Bonding (Stockholm Syndrome) – a form of coercive control in which the perpetrator instills in the victim fear as well as gratitude for being allowed to live or for any other perceived favors, however small.Click to read about Ark of Hope's planned Harbourage Safe Homes for Child Trafficking Victims 2012 UNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME Global Report - ViennaU.S. Trafficking In Persons Report - June 2012Trafficking Victims Protection ActU.S. Trafficking In Persons Report - June 2011Child Trafficking Update - October 2011Defender FoundationFBI on Human Sex Trafficking – March 2011Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, HanoiChild Victims of Human Trafficking Report- Dept Health & Human ServicesCrimes Against Children Report- Interpol – September 2009Trafficking in Human Beings Report- Interpol – December 2009 








do not understand moderationFor those who don’t or refuse to believe that we will be Raptured before the Tribulation must not read there bible. It saddens me.Sorry, it’s at the 7th trumpet, not before. That is a feel good gospel. That is an escape route gospel and that is NOT bible. There’s no foundation there whatsoever.
Revelation 11:15-19 that is the appearing of JESUS (YESHUA) and that is the resurrection of the saints same as the (rapture-the catching up) of the saints…I read where God shut the door on the ark and not one drop of rain fell on Noah and his family also lot was saved from the city of sin set for us as an example I believe God will rapture the church will take place before great tribulation and the dispensation of the Gentiles will be fulfilled God will turn from gentile back to Jews and will save them in tribulation amenI believe there is no such thing as a 7 year tribulation.I believe that first of all there is the covenant which the antichrist makes with many.That starts Daniels 70th week.After three and a half years comes the abomination of desolation when the antichrist takes centre stage and the mark of the beast is introduced.Up till this mid point is the tribulation then at the mid point the great tribulation starts and world wide persecution of us christians occurs.Then after a short time the sun is darkened and the moon does not give its light and the rapture occurs at the 2nd coming which is 1 Thess 4:13-18,Matt 24:31.Then the wrath of god is poured out which lasts for about 3 years or so.Rev 19 when Jesus comes on a white horse with us behind him is not the same event as Matt 24:30 when He comes in the clouds.Thats when He sets up His kingdom after armageddon.So the tribulation and the great tribulation lasts just over three and a half years and Gods wrath the rest of the time.This fits scripture like a glove.Matt 24 and Rev 6 match perfectly.The rapture occurs just after the 6th seal and we in seen as the great multitude in heaven in Rev 7.That is a very astute observation you have made concerning the similarity between the Rapture and Noah’s Ark, Tchild. It makes perfect sense.Why don’t you read about all those who were filled with Yahweh’s people at Pentecost and the tribulation they went through.  Why don’t you read the 4th Seal which represents the Roman Empire that killed off the last of Yahweh Messiah’s elect and they were loyal up to their deaths.  Now Christians are taught they are going to escape the Tribulation Period which is for 3 1/2 years not 7, sorry, but it won’t happen and Christianity will be the One World Religion at that time.  The Christians are the ones who will kill Yahweh Messiah’s elect at that time.tom It saddens me that when you make mistakes spelling, you might be making mistakes reading, so with that said. I read scripture all the time and I disagree with you. The “Parousia” happened in the 1st century after the second temple was destroyed by the romans.  Jesus told the world out of each and every generation god will call his own to him and his kingdom will know no and expand forever, just as the world will abide for ever, Amen.
Every time you see a rainbow
 do you not remember gods promise to Noah?The dead being raised at the last trumpet, is a resurrection to be with Christ during His millennial kingdom on earth. The resurrection is not the same as a rapture of those alive on earth. Which is not to say that some will not be raptured at that time in their resurrected bodies to also be with Christ during His millennial reign – who proved faithful and worthy through the crucible of the tribulation. I have a thorough analysis in my rapture teaching of Jesus paper that everyone can probably get very important and helpful insight from, but most importantly why believers need to be alert, be ready and to be spiritually prepared for this event, and what He means by that.
http://bibletruthsandteachings.simplesite.com
Briefly, I will just say I have studied end times for decades, but the Lord has fairly recently given me this insight to share and teach at this time, for His purposes.
In His service,
TroyTroy I guess you deleted 1 Thes. 4:16-17 from your scriptures. The dead in Christ rise first and we who are alive at Hi coming are caught up to meet the dead and Jesus in the air. The 1st resurrection (Rev. 20:5) includes the 2 witnesses, the 144,000, the dead in Christ and the raptured saints. There are 2 and only 2 resurrections of the dead. One for the righteous (1st) and one for the wicked (2nd) That is what scripture specifically says so where do you get something different?Yes but also the dead who are not in Christ will also arise but for everlasting shame and contempt according to Daniel 12.Mari, you are absolutely right.  This is what people are not being taught.  Preachers do not know the whole truth to this and why it will happen.  Even those who believe this do not know the whole truth to it either.Isaiah 26:19 But your dead will live; their bodies will rise.  You who dwell in the dust, wake up and shout for joy. Your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead. verse 20 Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by.  v21See, the Lord is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins.  The earth will disclose the blood shed upon her; she will conceal her slain no longer.  Also Daniel 12:2 Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to everlasting contempt.If you have studied for decades, why don’t you know that Yahweh is the Messiah’s name?
2 Thessalonians 2:11
10.  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
11.  For this reason Yahweh sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.
1 John 2: 22,23
22. Who is a liar but he that denieth that Yahweh is the Messiah? He is Anti-Messiah, that denieth the Father and the Son.
23. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.
1 John 4:1-3
1. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of Yahweh: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
2. Hereby know ye the Spirit of Yahweh: Every spirit that confesseth that Yahweh Messiah is come in the flesh is of Yahweh:
3. And every spirit that confesseth not that Yahweh Messiah is come in the flesh is not of Yahweh: and this is that spirit of Anti-Messiah, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
1 John 2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that Anti-Messiah shall come, even now are there many Anti-Messiahs; whereby we know that it is the last time.
2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Yahweh Messiah is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver a Anti-Messiah.
Acts 18:28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Yahweh was the Messiah.
NOTE:  The name of Jesus Christ, or any other name, Yahshua, Yeshua, are all anti-Messiah names and any other name people may use for salvation, except for Yahweh’s name.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             YAHWEH MESSIAH IMPALED

John 1:1
1.  IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and THE WORD WAS WITH YAHWEH, AND THE WORD WAS YAHWEH.1 Timothy 3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of righteousness: YAHWEH WAS MANIFEST IN THE FLESH, justified in the Spirit, seen of Messengers, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into heaven.Colossians 1:15-17,19
15. WHO IS THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE YAHWEH, the first born of all creation;
16. FOR IN HIM WERE ALL THINGS CREATED, IN THE HEAVENS AND UPON THE EARTH, THINGS VISIBLE, INVISIBLE, WHITHER THRONES OR DOMINIONS OR PRINCIPALITIES OR POWERS; ALL THINGS HAVE BEEN CREATED THROUGHT HIM, AND TO HIM.
17. AND HE IS BEFORE ALL THINGS, AND IN HIM ALL THINGS CONSIST.
19.  FOR IT WAS THE GOOD PLEASURE OF THE FATHER THAT IN HIM SHOULD ALL THE FULNESS DWELL;Colossians 2:9
FOR IN HIM DWELLETH ALL THE FULNESS OF YAHWEH BODILY.2 John 1:7 For MANY DECEIVERS ARE ENTERED INTO THE WORLD, WHO CONFESS NOT THAT YAHWEH MESSIAH IS COME IN THE FLESH.  THIS IS A DECEIVER A ANTI-MESSIAH.Acts 18:28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, SHOWING BY THE SCRIPTURES THAT YAWHEH WAS THE MESSIAH.Acts 17:3 Opening and alleging, that the Messiah must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and THAT THIS IMMANUEL, WHOM I PREACH UNTO YOU, IS YAHWEH.1 Corinthians 1:23
23. But WE PREACH YAHWEH IMPALED, UNTO THE HEBREWS A STUMBLING BLOCK AND UNTO THE GENTILES FOOLISHNESS;Isaiah 2:10-11
10. Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of Yahweh, and for the esteem of his majesty.
11. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and YAHWEH ALONE SHALL BE EXALTED IN THAT DAY.Revelation 6:15-17
15.  Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and
16.  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and HIDE US FROM THE FACE OF HIM WHO SITTETH ON THE THRONE AND FROM THE WRATH OF THE LAMB!
17.  FOR THE GREAT DAY OF HIS WRATH HAS COME, AND WHO SHALL STAND?John 3:36  He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; BUT THE WRATH OF YAHWEH ABIDETH ON HIM.Revelation 1:8
8. “ I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA,” SAYS THE SOVERIEGN YAHWEH, WHO IS AND WHO WAS AND WHO IS TO COME, THE ALMIGHTY.Psalms 83:16-18
16. Fill their faces with shame; THAT THEY MAY SEEK THY NAME, O YAHWEH.
17. Let them be confounded and troubled forever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
18. THAT MEN MAY KNOW THAT THOU, WHOSE NAME ALONE IS YAHWEH, ART THE MOST HIGH OVER ALL THE EARTH.Malachi 2: 16
16. THEN THEY THAT FEARED YAHWEH SPOKE ONE WITH ANOTHER; AND YAHWEH LISTENED, AND HEARD, AND A BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE WAS WRITTEN BEFORE HIM, FOR THEM THAT FEARED YAHWEH, AND THAT THOUGHT UPON HIS NAME.Isaiah 43:11
11. I, EVEN I, AM YAHWEH; AND BESIDE ME THERE IS NO SAVIOR.Zipcodey, you cited 1 Jn 2:22 as:22. “Who is a liar but he that denieth that Yahweh is the Messiah? He is Anti-Messiah, that denieth the Father and the Son.”The KJV certainly doesn’t render that verse that way.  Rather, it is:[22] Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.The name “Yahweh” never appears in the New Testament; rather, the expression “The Lord” is used to mean anything from the Graecized Jewish euphonym for God, to any earthly lord or master, to what is is used for today in Israel, i.e. “Sir”.  Which is to be rendered as which, depends on the context; but in the text you cite, this word is not even used:  Jesus is explicitly called ιησους,  “Jesus”.Michael S., I believe you need to study Constantine, he was the one who started Christianity and gave you the name Jesus Christ name to believe in.  Jesus, Christ, Lord, God, Amen, Hades, Hell, Sacred, Angel, Adonai, are just some of the pagan sun deity names that were put into the scriptures and they took Yahweh’s name out making the scriptures void of salvation.  Yes, this was supposed to have happened if you knew scriptures.  I am well studied and you have no clue to what happened to the scriptures and why you use the name Jesus Christ, not knowing that Yahweh is the Messiah’s name, the only name given for salvation.I have “never” seen a bible with the names YAHWEH or YESHUA. They are all GOD the FATHER, and JESUS CHRIST His Son.
Yahweh is GOD’s name and YESHUA is JESUS name, that much is truth. We don’t pray to them as such b/c that’s “not” what people have been taught to do. I have mentioned those two names to people and they want to know who I am talking about. They “never” knew those names before.I know one thing instead debating just know that we should get it together and quick because Jesus is coming soon we need to ready our self’s before its to late..I have visions in dreams , I just know one thing I’m going to live every day like its my last and follow each step as the voice of truth tells me….I know you hear it tooAmen, always be ready. And tell everyone you know about the Lord Jesus! Have a blessed day.Yuppers you are correct sir…
what gets me (about the Yahweh stuff) is the quote where the angel clearly calls him Jesus and Emmanuel.
any-one saying differently are just confused and think “they” know and everyone else is wrong, what a goofy thing to think, the only thing that really matters; is the first 2 commandments, not; I’m right and you are wrong; clearly people like that are not open for discussions about salvation.
“And thou shalt call his name Jesus (SALVATION = YESHUA);
for he shall save [salvage] his people from their sins!
Jesus is the English word for YahwehYAHWEH is the original name of GOD, and YESHUA is the original name of JESUS CHRIST (his son).
GOD is the spiritual FATHER…
JESUS is the earthly SON…and
The HOLY SPIRIT was the comforter that would lead us into all truth.
And when you know the “truth”, the truth will set you free (spiritually free) to know right from wrong, truth from error and the real from the fake.Hi, TroyI do not have time to check your link; but I agree with everything you have said here.  Irvin, and apparently all “Pre-Millenial Rapture” advocates, base their doctrine on the one scripture you have cited, namely,
“We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”
That passage, indeed, says nothing of a “rapture”.  When one looks intently into the passage about the “seventh trumpet”, one also sees no mention of any rapture.  The “Rapture”, in fact, is one of the least-attested of Christian doctrines; and indeed, it was not once mentioned as a doctrine until 1830.  It does sell millions of books, though.
The doctrine is intimately entwined in the Pentecostal movement, having begun with a woman named Margaret Macdonald.
cf. http://www.askelm.com/essentials/ess025.htm
Unsurprizingly, she did not deduce the doctrine from a careful study of the Bible, but from a direct revelation she believed she had received.
I agree with you, Troy, that the cited scripture was intended to reinforce faith in the resurrection, not a rapture — something one would readily deduce by reading the passage in its context.
BTW, I do acknowledge that Irvin and many here are Pentecostals.  My remarks are not meant as a personal slur against them or anyone.  We should seek to agree with one another as much as possible, for the sake of the Body of Christ; so let’s not all get too hot under the collar or not.  The only real “proof” of a rapture will happen on the “morning after” — of which, I say with dismay, we have had many in recent decades.You pre-tribulation people are going to have a rude awakening.  But Christians will anyway at the beginning of the 7 Year Peace Plan when you find out Christianity has never been the truth.YAHWEH COLLECTS HIS ELECT:
 
1 Thessalonians 1:10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Yahweh, which delivered us from the wrath to come. 
 
2 Peters 2:9 Yahweh knoweth how to deliver the righteous out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
 
1 Thessalonians 5:9  For Yahweh hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Master Yahweh Messiah, 
 
John 14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; THAT WHERE I AM, THERE YE MAY BE ALSO.
 
Isaiah 40:10  Behold, Yahweh will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with Him, and his work before Him.
 
Mark 13:24-27
24. But in those days, AFTER THAT TRIBULATION, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
25. And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
26. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and righteousness.
27.  And then shall he send his Messengers, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
 
Before going further, I’d like to say the Jerome’s Latin Vulgate is the only scriptures that used the word “RAPTURE” which the root word of it is “RAPE” which means taken by force in 1 Thessalonians 4:16.  It was the only scriptures to be had for over 1000 years locked up in the Latin tongue.   Christians still use that word today passed down through the generations.
 
Matthew 24:30-31
30.  And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the CLOUDS of heaven with power and great esteem.
31.  And He shall send his Messengers with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
                                        
1 Thessalonians 4:16-18
16. For Yahweh himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch Messenger, and with the trump of Yahweh and the dead in Yahweh shall rise first:
17. Then we which are alive and remain shall be (caught up together with them in the clouds (spacecraft), to meet Yahweh in the air; and so shall we ever be with Yahweh.1 Corinthians 15:52  “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.” So you are wrong Michael S.Recall that satan disregarded the rest of scripture when he tempted Jesus to throw Himself to His death. You need to look at other ‘resurrection’ passages to build up the picture:-
1 Thess 4
16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the TRUMPET CALL of God, and THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL RISE FIRST. 17 AFTER THAT, we who are STILL ALIVE and are left will be CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
Which part of ‘RISE‘, ‘CAUGHT UP’ FIRST’, ‘AFTER’ AND ‘TOGETHER’ is not clear ?
Lets get another piece of the whole picture….
This ‘TRUMPET CALL’ must be the LAST trumpet:
1 Cor 15:52
…….at the LAST trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the DEAD WILL BE RAISED imperishable,All perfectly lear from my point of view. If you’ve been studying for decades I suggest you step back for a while and come back to it later with a fresh unbiased mind….and a little revelation wouldn’t do any harm either.Hello, KevI have to gather, from what you say, that you believe the “last” trumpet to be the seventh trumpet preceeding Messiah’s return.  There will definitely be a partial resurrection at that time; but the time when “those of us who remain until his coming” are transformed, could be any time after that and before the final judgment: 1 Thes. 4:
[15] For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
[16] For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
[17] THEN we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.I assume that the word “then” means “after that”, as it is translated in many versions.  This “rapture”, therefore, when we are “caught up with him in the clouds”, could well happen at the END of the millennium, not the beginning.
Whenever the rapture occurs, it will be AFTER the great persecution which, as far as I can see, is ushered in by the fifth trumpet, if not sooner; as the sixth trumpet speaks of the signs that Jesus said (in Matt. 24) are to happen “immediately AFTER the tribulations of that day”.The scriptures are clear, then, that the rapture is post-tribulation, and quite possibly post-millennial.The word “Rapture” was only used in Jerome’s Latin Vulgate the only scriptures to be had for over 1000 years locked up in the Latin tongue.  “This “rapture”, therefore, when we are “caught up with him in the clouds”, could well happen at the END of the millennium, not the beginning.”The catching up takes place at the coming of Yahweh Messiah, then He wipes out all the armies that came against Jerusalem at that time.  He kills everyone left on earth at that time and burns them up.  He then brings His elect right back to this earth for the Millennial Kingdom.  This is when He teaches all those who never heard the truth or had the opportunity to believe it or not.  Right after the Millennial Kingdom which is right here on this earth, then is when Satan is released for the final judgement to deceive the world one last time…..no excuses.  Caught up in the clouds, clouds represent spacecraft.  There will be so many when He returns they will actually block out the sun and moon.The Rapture and the 1st resurrection are one and the same. It’s a PRE-WRATH Rapture. It happens “after” the tribulation, but “before” the wrath of GOD. The church “is not” appointed to the “wrath of GOD”, therefore JESUS will appear in the clouds with a host of HIs heavenly Angels (not saints) and that is when the dead in CHRIST that were asleep in their graves will “rise up”. They’re not “coming down out of Heaven”, but “rising up” from their graves.
It’s not pre-trip b/c that’s not biblically sound doctrine at all, and the only thing that is, is that GOD will take us out of here just before his wrath falls onto ALL of the unrepentant sinners…The church will suffer. That’s “not” what they are taught b/c it’s not a “feel good gospel”, it’s sugar coated gospel to keep everybody happy. But, it’s also a “false” gospel. People won’t be prepared for what is coming. NOW is the time to prepare spiritually, mentally, and physically.The scriptures that the Devil twists to support his Pre-Tribulation Rapture Doctrine really refer to the Great White Throne Judgment that occurs when the Earth is about to end AFTER the Great Tribulation, AFTER the 1000 year Reign of Christ on Earth and AFTER the Gog-Magog wars. The earth ends when our sun like any other star in the universe approaches the end of its life, swells up becoming a red giant and vaporizes the Earth and everything else around it. This is the lake of fire talked about in the scripture below.2 Peter 3:10-13 “But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and Godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed his coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. But in keeping with his promises we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of the righteous.”This scripture talks about how all of the dead are resurrected to face this final judgement and what happens to those whose names are not in the book of life.Rev 20:11-15 “Then I saw a great white throne and him (Jesus) who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence (as well as from the sun’s heat), and there was no place for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and the books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. ( left to burn in the dying sun’s heat) The lake of fire is the second death. If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”The following scripture says what happens to those whose names are found in the book of life.Rev 21:1-4 “ Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”The rest of Revelation Chapter 21 goes on to describe the new Jerusalem which has to be a super-natural spiritual city (ie heaven) because anything physical will be vaporized by the dying sun’s heatIf you read the most famous “rapture” scripture below after reading about the Great White Throne Judgment in Revelation 20 and 21 it is easy to see that is referring to the Great White Throne Judgment and not some imaginary rapture thousands of years earlier before or immediately after the Great Tribulation period.1 Thess 4:15-17 “According to the Lord’s own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord (with the New Jerusalem at the end of the earth), will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of god, and the dead in Christ will rise first (to be judged according to Rev 20:11-15). After that, we who are still alive and are LEFT (name written in the book of life) will be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And we will be with the Lord forever. (according to Revelation chapter 21)The Great White Throne judgment is also referred to in the following scriptures. Again when you put all of the pieces of the puzzle together you get the complete picture of the Great White Throne Judgment that each scripture alone can’t provide.John 5:28:29 “Do not be amazed by this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out – those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.”1 Cor 15: 51-53 “Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed – in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.”Matt 25:31-46. “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats…..”Dear Brethren,

Punjab PakistanKeep up the good work!I thank God for his Spirit on every believers who know the truth of the gospel, God has made us understand the time of his coming back here on earth again to take his church home. We study the bible and we found truth, and our spirit agreed to the word of the Lord. Weather to know the time and period shouldn’t be a problem with us, we should have God in our heart and maintain our relationship with Him still that day God put in his own power. Talking about it always is to remind us not to forget quickly about our hope we have in Him and to let the unbelievers believe in Christ and the gospel of Christ we preach. I want to use this great opportunity to thank you all for the grace of God upon your life the wisdom of God giving to you all to teach and to make the word of God to be heard every where, through medias and internet, God bless you all Amen.Was wondering about Revelation 9:20-21.  I agree that the scriptures leading up to this pertain to WW3 and that from this war a third of mankind will die. But verse 20-21 says that the rest (remaining 2/3 of mankind) repent not and they continue in their wicked ways.  This seems to say that the rapture must be before or during WW3 since those 2/3’s who survive it remain with an unrepented heart and continue to be wicked.  Another words, the righteous in Christ are not part of those who survive this war according to scripture.  Any thoughts?100% agree. The rapture and the second coming of Christ are two separate events. Christ will save his children from the great Tribulation and he is coming after the tribulation to defeat the Anti-christ, satan, and the rest of the wicked who did not repent. Then his kingdom will be established. But before all of that is said and done, we will be raptured from the earth. What would be the point in    a rapture if believers had to go through the Tribulation? Those who are left behind will have to make a decision to follow Christ or the anti-christ. Those people are the ones who will wait for Christ’s second return.Katlyn, I agree the rapture and His 2nd coming are two separate events.  I disagree with your view of it.  One reason is because the dead shall be raised first.  When will the dead be raised?  1 Cor 15:23 “At his coming.”   John 6:40 “At the last day.”
Mark 13:24-27: “..After that tribulation…Also, I asked myself, “What are we being raptured out from?  After What tribulation”   Rev 2:17, 26 – He that overcometh “Unto the end,”  Rev 3:10 “I also will keep the from the HOUR of temptation, which shall come upon ALL the world…”  Rev 18:4 is where I see the rapture happening, “Come out of her, my people…”  We are rapture out here, before Jesus destroys the earth in one day, and one Hour Vs 10, 17, 29.     Then Jesus returns in Ch 19 vs 11, which IS 2 separate events.If we, His people, are raptured out before Rev 18, then why is there a need for Jesus to say Come out of her, My people in Rev 18? Thanks Katlyn for letting me respond with my view, and questions.Oh he speaking of coming out of the worldly system of things. We were told to be in the world, but not of the world. Therefore he is telling us to come out so we don’t have to suffer their plagues or the last set of judgments…
It has nothing there to do with the rapture (the catching away of the saints).
You will however find all that in Revelation 11:15-19…Read that and let me know what you have discovered. JESUS comes and takes this evil world away from satan right there at the 7th trumpet, but “before” the wrath of GOD is poured out onto all of the unrepentant sinners. It’s a Pre-wrath rapture of the church.Yahweh Messiah comes back only one more time.  Everyone alive at the time of the Tribulation will go through it.  People who except the truth of the Word of Yahweh during the Tribulation Period, they will be persecuted and even killed for their testimony that Yahweh is true.
The reason for the catching up is so Yahweh’s people do not have to go through His Wrath that he pours out on this earth and when He kills every person left on earth with fire and burns them up.  He then sets up His Millennial Kingdom on earth, so no one goes to heaven.  He said where I am, there ye shall be also.
All this left behind stuff is nothing but a lie.  Those left behind, will be burned up.
Why don’t you read how the people in the days of Peter and Paul were persecuted and were killed.  They are the ones under the table at the beginning of the 5th Seal, waiting for those who like them will be killed during the Tribulation Period.WW3 >>>> 7 Year Peace Plan – NO 3rd House of Yahweh, Dome of the Rock will be used >>>> Moses and Eliyah bring back the truth – killed midway of Peace Plan >>>> Pope takes power – start of Tribulation Period – Christianity made World Religion – Mark of the Beast given – Yahweh’s elect persecuted and killed >>>> Armageddon >>>> Return of Yahweh >>>> Millennial Kingdom on earth >>>> Satan loosed to deceive the world one last time – White Throne Judgement – End of this world.I think the rapture will be right after the war/during the war.  …..for the sake of the elects those days will be shortened….Did you read Revelation 11:15-19? That’s a very powerful scripture and it tells us that JESUS will come at that moment and take possession of the world from satan at that time. Read that and see for yourself. It says it’s time for the dead to be judged, and that JESUS has possession and will reign from now on (this is at the 7th trumpet, not before and not after).I believe the righteous will be taken up to be changed for the war, while the rest of humanity will be left behind to suffer or repent for the final test. Then all will be put right. Order: 7th Trumpet, coinciding with Rapture, 7 years Tribulation while simultaneous battle of Heaven out of sight, ending in Victory, and defeat of evil. We gotta get home to put on our armor and wings! 🙂  <3I don’t recall where this came from, but what are your thoughts on this concerning pre-trib rapture seeing that you are a post-tribulationist? What is your position on this? Rapture & Second Coming 2 separate events
8 January 2011 at 15:06RAPTURE (CAUGHT UP)            While it is true that the word ‘rapture’ is not in the Bible, but the word ‘caught up’ is found In the first Latin Bible (Latin Vulgate). The Greek word “harpazo” is translated “rapiemur,” which comes from the same latin verb “raptus’ which means “caught-up” or”caught-away” The literal meaning is to “seize or carry off quickly.” It points to a swift snatching away, 1 Corinthians 15:52 says it will happen in the “twinkling of an eye!” RAPTUREChrist’s bride, the Church is rescued before the TribulationsSECOND COMING    Saints return with Christ, Justice is done, and His Kingdom is established.1.

It is a message of HOPE and meant to                 17. It is a message of JUDGMENT.1 Thes. 4:18; Titus 2:13; 1 John 3:2-3             Joel 3:12-16; Mal. 4:5; Rev. 19:11-21.The verse comparison indicates they may be referring to two different events occurring at two different times.The rapture is the same as His appearing. He comes with His host of Heavenly Angels and He appears in the clouds. His feet do not touch the ground.
THEN, after the 1,000 reign with CHRIST, He returns on a white horse, and His saints from heaven (the bride) accompany Him. At this time He sets His feet on the ground and that is when they will fight the battle at Armageddon.I can easily see two separate events here, as they both are described with different things happening. As you said, one is with Angels, one is with Saints, one says he meets them up in the clouds, the other says he rides in on a white horse. He doesn’t touch the ground at the appearing but only calls up the saints from the graves and the ones that still remain on the earth will be called up and this is happening at the 7th trumpet Rev.11:15-19…whereas the other one describes Him as stepping foot on the ground.
So, two different descriptions of two separate events in my opinion. Wonder if anyone else sees it this way?Yes, wandakate: this is true, so many think the 1000 years are spent on earth, not so. Jeremiah 4: 23-28 confirms this…But isn’t tribulation from man and satan?  Wrath is from God such as Noah’s flood time and Sodom and Gomorrah.Tribulation is the wrath of satan upon the whole world and especially all the Christians which satan hates.
The wrath of GOD are the very last 7 judgments of Revelation. There is no escape route out for Christians. They are around for everything until the 7th trumpet of the LORD, then they will rise up. JESUS will appear and open up the graves all over.
Then after the millennium he will return (the second coming) and fight the battle at Armageddon at that time.
First time He comes with His host of Angels, but the next time (at the second coming) He will be with all of His saints (the church) and He will appear on a white horse and proceed to win the battle of all wars once and for all. Satan won’t have a chance and neither will any of his followers.im confused, some say there will be an earth impact  this year or next, that the powers of the world will construct a staged rapture, to decieve the christians of the world to not believe, that a hologram of showing people being raptured and others left to be angry they didnt go, thus making them question their lord, and HIS promise. Then there is a saying that the antichrist , matrayia, will become the peace maker with middle east then the seven years starts of tribulation, others say that before that time or after sometime, that the second tribulation will happen, I am so confused, what do we ,as believers have to do to know this is a hoax and not believe, then what do we do to survive the forced immunizations that have the chip so they say,  then what do we do to survive the horrific things that will come upon the world and what do you all think about the supposedly proof that there are two suns in the skys now. Is the one really nibiru and will it impact the world? some say it is being covered up? to not create turmoil that many will perish, is this in the Bible, will God allow this to happen to mankind soon?I would like to suggest that you read the scriptures Matthew 24 and others to know what is and is not going to happen.
Listening to all these “people” is enough to confuse anybody, b/c chances are they don’t know what is right and what is wrong. They don’t know their bibles, they are just making it up as they go.
JESUS will come at the end when the 7th trumpet blows and not before or after according to Rev. 11:15-19. Remember it says “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the “last trumpet”. How many are after the last one? None…He doesn’t let the church suffer the wrath of GOD, only the wrath of satan which were the seals and the trumpets. Scripture tells us that we will suffer persecution, trials, and tribulations.
The soldiers of CHRIST have always suffered, so why would we be exempt? It would be the height of arrogance to think otherwise.
JESUS said we must endure to the end in order to be saved. That is in Revelation.
Study the word and learn the truth that will set you free and stop being deceived by man and what they think they know. The masses are always wrong.agreedMarie, you need to study Matthew, Daniel and Revelation to be able to understand the end-time.
I am a Bible scholar and believe me you need to get all of Irvin Baxter’s videos or CD’s. Believe me that I also teach the end time and been doing it for 35 years — this man has it right.  You need to study the scriptures don’t listen to those that don’t know where to locate what they tell you including some pastors!  The Bible interprets the Bible and that is the truth!  “The Truth Will Make You Free!  Don’t just read Darnel and Revelation Study them!Hi Precious Person
When Jesus comes in the air it will be in a twinkling of a eye 1. It will happen so fast you won’t even have time to think a thought . A twinkling of a eye would be like when you blink before your eyelids come back up your out of here . 2. He is doing it you won’t have time to ponder is this my Jesus or a trick .
3. Remember you are sealed and nothing can snatch you out of his hands .
I know there are so many things like that going around . To produce fear and doubt .
It wouldn’t surprise me if they try to explain our disappearance as aliens ( really demons ) took us ..
But many will remember what we told them , even though they didn’t believe us .
God said his word will not come back void .
If you are a Child of God you have nothing to fear . You are safe in his loving arms .
Peace BelovedI want to learn more about the raptureCheryl…did you read Revelation 11:15-19? JESUS comes right then and takes this world’s government away from satan. The graves open, the people are judged, the ark of the covenant is seen there. Study and pray that GOD will open your eyes to His truth that is found in the word.
That truth will set you free.
There is “NO” secret rapture. Nobody’s going anywhere until (as Irvin says) the 7th trumpet judgment. That is when JESUS will appear.
We spend our 1,000 years with Him and then He returns for the battle at Armageddon. Don’t be confused or deceived. There is NO pre-tribulation rapture and there is No escape route either…Pray for wisdom from above.helloHi Pastor Baxter.  Thank you for your view about this topic.  I am open to the thought that the B.O.R. has already begun, based upon historical events, comparing Bible Prophecy, since John wrote the B.O.R almost 2,000 years ago. He was seeing events in HIS future, not necessarily OURS, which makes sense to me.  So Seals, and trumpets could have been opened already.   You also think the Rapture will occur at the 7th Trumpet.   I have two questions…   1: You can see a comparison of trumpet soundings to WW1, WW2, Chernobyl, etc.  What do you believe were the Seals, in history?    2:  If the Rapture happens at the 7th trumpet, how can you explain Rev 18:4 where it says, “Come out of her, my people.”    If we’re already raptured previously, then why is there a need for Jesus to say this, in Rev 18?  Thank you, and God bless you.I think is somewhat like Isaiah 26:20-21  Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by.  See, the Lord is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins.  The earth will disclose the blood shed upon her; she will conceal her slain no longer.  It is believed that right after the tribulation the rapture will take place, that’s why he is saying that they should come out.Yes, after the tribulation but “before” the wrath of GOD. Because the tribulation and GOD’s wrath are not the same, and that is what is confusing people.
The church is NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD, therefore just prior to the last set of 7 judgments JESUS will appear in the clouds of heaven and remove the ones who were in their graves and the ones who were still alive and take them up with Him. THEN, the 1,000 yr. reign of CHRIST will happen, and then the second coming where he will come on a white horse, he will step foot on the ground and fight the last battle ever at the Battle at Armageddon. He will come from heaven with His heavenly saints (the ones who were raptured up). After that satan, the false prophet, the antichrist and all sinners will go to the pits and the Church will forever be with the LORD in the Kingdom of GOD for eternity.
So, comfort each other with those words. If we belong to the LORD, we will reign with the LORD, just as He said we would.Michael, Believe me whom I understand you don’t know.  Please believe that if you will take time to open your Bible and do what Revelation Chapter 1 Verse 3 and Chapter 22: verse 7 these two scriptures tell you something good!  these scriptures tells us that if you just overhear someone read the Revelation Prophecies and take what you hear to heart. God tells us in those two scriptures that you will be blessed each and every time your read and take what you read or hear and take it to heart God will give us a blessings.  My sweet wife and I receive continued because we read and study and teach Daniel and Revelation and Irvin Baxter’s videos help a lot because he also teaches that the Bible interprets the Bible! if it doesn’t sound right and your studies prove what ever it wrong, you will then know that what is said may be wrong, but always compare what you hear and read with the truth of the Bible!
I am also a Bible Scholar and this man has it right or as right as it can be.  I suggest that you obtain Irvin Baxter’s videos and training because like I said I have compared much of his work with the Bible and it appears that he allow the Bible to interpret the Bible and remember that the truth will make you free.  Don’t you believe it or anyone else if it can’t be compared to the truth of the Bible.  God intended us to serve and he would help us understand but God always intended for those that are living in the end time to be able to understand things that no one prior could because the time was not right for the en time understanding.  In Daniel it is said to such up the 7 thunders until the end time.  Everything is pretty-well open now because we are without question in the end time.  Don’t believe watch the news every day for a month and you will understand that everything is building just like the Bible tells will happen!  The current events will be like a woman’s birth pains, this will get faster and faster until it become obvious where we are in time.  Prophecies are also already looking like the readings of the newspapers aand the TV’s news.  Also be a watcher because one of the 5 crowns that the Bible says we can will be the watchers crown and that means if we are watching we are also studying and Taking Revelation Chapter 1, verse 3 and Revelation Chapter 22: verse 7 to heart.  I myself desire as many blessing as God will allow me to have.  I personally hope that my wife and I will win the five crowns the Bible says that we can win!
Your friend in Jesus,
JimmyBRevelation is not written strictly in chronological order therefore you may have read a chapter that actually was before another chapter. Ch. 18 for instance could have happened before ch. 6. They weren’t written in the order that John saw them. He was taken from earth to heaven and back again over a period of time with the visions. So this should help to explain why. Irvin is correct, JESUS appears at the 7th trumpet, not before. The dead will rise at that time, and all the ones who are still on earth will rise also and be with JESUS. He’s coming with a multitude of heavenly angels and He will be coming in the clouds of heaven. He will not touch the ground this time. The graves will open and those people the ones who were dead (sleeping) in their graves will rise up (same as be raptured) and go to be with JESUS and His host of angels right then. See Revelation 11:15-19 and it explains some of this. JESUS takes possession of the earth from satan right then.Just curious, how do you know revelation was not writen in cronological order?Wandakate, can you give me an answer to what I posted on May 10, 2015 pertaining to what the bible seems to say about the rapture being before or during WW3 in Rev. 9:20-21 ?  TIA.Richard…pls realize that the book of Revelation was not written in chronological order. John had visions that were taking him from earth to heaven and back again. It’s not written like a regular book, but in the style of apocalyptic language that John used back then, his familiar writing style.
This brings us to Revelation 11:15-19 which tells us that at the 7th trumpet JESUS will appear and at that time He will take possession of this evil world that we now live in from satan and He will begin right then to rule heaven and earth.
He will also at that time bring up the saints that died and the ones who remain alive at that time.
We see from this particular passage that it’s not happening until the 7th trumpet. The judgments will fall in order from 1-7 as read so they are in order, however the remainder of the book is not. Hope this helps…I disagree. How do you know the book of revelation was not written in chronological order? Can you shoe us from scripture?I just explained it briefly to Richard above.When do you believe the rapture will happen?We cannot say for sure.Very funny ,John! lolFunny? In what way?We don’t know for sure? We were told to be awake, be aware, alert, and to be watching, ready, and to know the signs of the times. Does Rev. 11:15-19 not reveal most of what we need to know? Jesus comes and takes possession of this world right then away from satan. The graves open and it’s time for the people to be judged then, and even the Ark of the Covenant will be seen at that time…That is enough proof.
The day or the hour wasn’t necessary, it’s actually irrelevant, it was the signs that JESUS told us to be watching for. When is the rapture?, at the 7th trumpet…Because after that is the last 7 judgments and they are all the bowl/vial judgments and are only meant to fall upon the unrepentant sinners. The church of GOD is not appointed to the wrath of GOD, we will be out before His wrath (the last judgments), the rest of those judgments were brought on us by satan, why? Because he is still the god of this world and is still allowed to be in charge per JESUS authority. When satan is done, then JESUS will take over. Hopefully this makes sense. The “appearing” of JESUS and the catching away/rapture are the very same event, they’re not separate, and it won’t be secret either. Loud and visible is what it will be. He comes with a shout, a trumpet call and the voice of the archangel, that sounds loud to me.I have always had problems with the pre-trib teaching because I belive the bible teaches a post-trib second coming and rapture. I attend a church which believes in the pre-trib theory. I am also one  of the associate ministers should I discuss this with the Pastor although he is firm with his teaching?First of all you should be in a church with like minded people. It’s hard to believe that you’re able to put on a front and stand by a pre-trib preacher when you have a post-trib opinion.
You’re pastor is a deceived man. The bible in no way supports a pre-trib rapture of the saints.
JESUS appearing is after the antichrist and the mark of the beast and after the tribulation of those days.
Satan’s wrath were the seal judgments and are  continuing through until the 7th trumpet sounds.
JESUS won’t appear for the saints until the 7th trumpet, regardless of what your pastor says.
YOU need to get right with the LORD in mind, spirit and body, so you are in unity with the outpouring of the HOLY SPIRIT. GOD’s the same now as He always was and wants us to worship Him in spirit and in truth.
You believe what you believe b/c that’s the truth. Unfortunately your pastor has it all wrong, and his message to the people isn’t biblical. The church is not appointed to the wrath of GOD, and that isn’t until the last set of 7 judgments (the bowl/vial judgments) that are in Revelation.
Satan’s wrath upon the Christians that he hates, and then JESUS appearing to take up the saved dead and alive and then GOD’s wrath and His judgments poured out on the unrepentant sinners. The truth will set you free.Be careful before you judge others beliefs. Jesus will reveal the truth when He is ready. Don’t judge what they believe how do u know they are wrong and u are right.If they follow the teachings of the Bible they’re right, and if they don’t then they are wrong, so it’s pretty simple. We will know them by their fruits…Shelly:  No one knows for sure, we are all giving our own interpretations.  Peter warned us about “personal interpretations.”  While speculation is helpful, it is also very confusing.  Most people will believe what feels more comfortable to us, what feels like the “truth” to us.  One person’s “truth” can be another person’s heresy.  Oh, and BTW, I have a KJV of the Bible called “The Life and Times Historical Reference Bible.”  It is a chronological journey through the Bible, culture and history.   Not to purposely contradict wandakate, but it does reveal that the ONLY book that IS in chronological order IS Revelation.  When we read Revelation, everything is in the proper sequence.  wandakate, this is an awesome version of the KJV.  I think you would really enjoy it.  I almost gave it away to a Protestant friend of mine until I decided to explore it one day.  Now, I wouldn’t give it up for anything.  The history in it is wonderful.  Peace to all.If Obama is still President in 2016-2017 due to some type of crisis that postpones the elections, wouldn’t he then be both the 6th and 7th King, which would ultimately mean he is the antichrist?No, that is not at all what that would mean. President Obama will leave office on schedule.Let’s pray he will however if we have some sort of huge catastrophe he has the authority to call martial law on the land and that means he’s sitting right where he is and not going out of office…John:  From you lips to God’s ears.  I would not be a bit surprised if Obama found a way to stay in office.  Blessings…The rapture will come when we are done doing Gods work. It is none of your business when the rapture will come, your business is the great commission. So get to work and maybe the rapture will come tomorrow or tonite.Sorry but the bible doesn’t say that. It tells us that JESUS will appear at the 7th trumpet in Revelation 11:15-19…
He also tells us that the apostasy (the great falling away) AND the man of sin (the antichrist) MUST come before JESUS will appear to raise the dead.
Those two things “must” happen before not after. Those who hold on to going out in the rapture have a false hope. They are deceived and have been unknowingly led astray. There is NO escape route.
We’re all here during the wrath of satan, but JESUS will get out His own before the wrath of GOD which isn’t until the final 7 judgments. Right at the 7th trumpet He will appear in the clouds and take up His church and then the wrath of GOD will be poured out onto the unrepentant sinners…The word “Rapture” was only used in Jerome’s Latin Vulgate, the only scriptures to be had for over 1000 years, locked up in the Latin tongue, which the common person did not know.  Yet, Christians still use that word today.No, the Catching Up, cannot happen at anytime.  It happens when the Messiah returns to fight the armies of every nation that goes against Jerusalem, at the end of the Tribulation Period.  Yes, everyone alive at that time will go through the Trib, there is no secret catching away and going to heaven.  He collects His people, right before He wipes those armies out, they are there also to fight Yahweh at His coming.The word “Rapture” did not hit the scene until the 1800’s.  The “Vulgate” only speaks of a 2nd return of Jesus, as both Bibles say today.  The Catholic Church has always taught that Jesus will come only one more time, at THE END OF TIME.  Catholics have never used the word Rapture.  We have always understood it as the Resurrection.  First the dead in Christ and then those that are left.  The Vulgate was in Latin BECAUSE that was the language they spoke then.  Rome, remember.  We have always been taught post tribulation.  You are comparing language of 2000 yrs. ago with modern day language.  We cannot do that.  We have to read the Bible in the traditions, customs and laws that it was written 2000 yrs. ago.  Blessings…The RAPTURE word came from Jerome’s Latin Vulgate and Christians today still use that word passed down through the generations.  Yahweh Messiah comes on one more time at the very end of the 3 1/2 year Trib.  When all the armies of every nation goes against Jerusalem the Harlot the last day Babylon.  The common person did not even know Latin.  Only the educated and those in government.  Only Christian priests like Wycliffe, Tyndale and Luther were allowed to teach the people in a language they did not even know…..There was not a Catholic denomination until the Council of Trent around the middle of the 16 century, to counter the Reformation.  Catholic just meant UNIVERSAL,,,,, Christianity a universal pagan religion that was created to absorb all pagan religions which it will do during the Trib.  The very reason for the Pope’s Ecumenical Movement.  You study your Catholicism as you want.  I study outside the walls of Christianity where the real truth is.Am i the only one who has noticed that no one calls Him Father here? Where’s the Love? Getting caught up in facts is what He doesnt want. He has a date and a time, and He may give it up as we grow closer, but im sure He wants us to focus on spreading our Love Energy to the world and bring more souls together to see His power. I felt called to say something.Will there be a pre-tribulation rapture. I think so. Here are the supporting scriptures with my comments. I think I should say this here even though it be a lion’s den situation.It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the honour of kings is to search out a matter – Proverbs 25:2
	–It is our honor to search out God’s truth.
Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secrets unto his servants the prophets – Amos 3:7
	–I am not a prophet, but I can search out what God told his prophets in his word, the Bible.At the end of Daniel, Daniel was trying to understand what had been shown. In the bible, the angel’s reply in Daniel 12 : 9-10 “And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. 10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
	–God is revealing things now to our generation because the time is near.
	Some Verses in the bible speaking on Jesus’s return:
Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him – 2 Thessalonians 2 v1
	–Paul is speaking of our gathering to Jesus. Setting the tone for his other teachings. The coming of the Lord and our gathering to him.
That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, no by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand – 2 Thessalonians 2 v2.
	–Day of Christ is also referred to in revelations – the tribulation. Don’t be terrified of the Day of Christ. It wasn’t happening then.Let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first and that the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition  – 2 Thessalonians 2 v3
	–Setting the conditions when the tribulation would occur. The word for falling away in Greek is apostasia – which means leave or depart. Before the King James was published, departure was the accepted translation for apostasia. The first 7 bibles translated from Greek to English used it this way; The departure. Gerome’s Latin translation in 400 AD translated it as The departure.
	–The message in Thessalonians is about the coming of Jesus.   In 2 Thessalonians 2:5, Paul says don’t you remember? When I was with you I taught you about these things?
–I don’t see where Paul taught them at all about “a falling away from the truth” in his first letter, but he taught them about the Rapture of the church in at least five passages in 1st Thessalonians:
1.	1 Thessalonians 1:10 “And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.”
	–Jesus saving us for the wrath to come. The wrath to come is the tribulation.
   2.  1 Thessalonians 2:19 “For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?”
   3.   1 Thessalonians 3:13 “To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.”
   4. 1 Thessalonians 4:13 – 5:10:Verse 13 “But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17 Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be CAUGHT UP together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
	–Comfort one other with these words! When people tell me that I have to go through the tribulation and get killed and see my wife go through who knows what, that is not a comfort to me. But Jesus taking his bride the church to heaven to avoid her harm is a comfort.
 In John 14:1-3, The bible says 1 “Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me. 2 “In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. 3 “If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.
	–Do not let your heart be troubled – fits in with Thessalonians above.Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him – Romans 5:9
	–Justified by Jesus’s blood; we accepted is free gift of salvation where he paid the price for our sin and we are saved from God’s wrath. Fits with Thessalonians and John.For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ – Thessalonians 5:9Isaiah 26:19-21, the bible says: Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. (20) Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. (21) For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.	–Stay in your room ( fits with John 14:1-3), in heaven while God punishes the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.Revelations 3:10  – Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.–	–How many times does the bible needs to tell us that Jesus will save us for the day of wrath? I know we might all deserve a good beating for serving God so poorly, but God is not a wife beater. He will not beat his bride before he marries her. Another reason why falling away does not seem to fit is Acts 2:16-18: “But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophasy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams. And on my servants and on my handmaidens, I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy”.
	—No exactly falling away. America is falling away, but in most parts of the world, Christianity is growing even in the face of persecution. Why we don’t get rapture at the end of the tribulation:
Revelations 19:6-8   The bible says “And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent regineth. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.
	–This takes place in heaven. The saints (church) are given fine clean white linen. Revelations 19:9 – And he said unto to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.	–The bride of Christ is blessed because we are kept from the wrath of God that befalls the unrighteous world.Revelations 19:14 –  “And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
	–This is Jesus’s return to earth at the battle of Armageddon. The Church who was in heaven now returns from heaven with Jesus after the wedding supper of the bride. Because we were not going through the tribulation on earth.Mattew 25:  “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish and five were wise. 3 The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. 4 The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. 5 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. 6 “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’ 7 “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’ 9 “‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ 10 “But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
11 “Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’ 12 “But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’	–People who hear the message but did not accept Jesus has their savior and filled with the Holy Spirit (oil) will be left because God never knew them. And sadly, they will be left in the tribulation to realize their error. They shall repent, but won’t be included in the rapture. They will have to go through the tribulation. We need to pray for everyone to come to salvation because the tribulation is too horrible to imagine. The world is ready to execute those that won’t bow to the new world order. On an interesting side note, Satan has been prepping his people (new age) movement that the day will come when the Christians will disappear because they are holding back the evolution of the rest of the world. This is called the Great Evacuation and the new age have been talking about it for a long time. The new age movement believes aliens will take the Christians to another world. Satan counterfeits God’s work. There are youtube videos, websites and even books. See amazon link — http://www.amazon.com/Project-World-Evacuation-22Great-Exodus-22/dp/0938294377?tag=duckduckgo-d-20Anyway, read the bible and ask God to explain it to you. The bible is a supernatural book. It is amazing and it is the word of God.Confusion here. The tribulation and the wrath of GOD are two separate things. Satan hates Christians and the scriptures says we will be persecuted, we will be martyred for our faith in JESUS. JESUS told us, “If they persecuted and hated me, they will do the same to you”.
Satan will bring his wrath upon the world to punish us. JESUS is allowing him to do this, as he will continue to be the god of this evil world until JESUS appears(same as the rapture-the catching away) of the saints.
JESUS has all authority in heaven and he was allowed to open the Seal judgments. He was the only one found worthy. He is allowing satan to bring his wrath onto the world in the form of the seal and trumpet judgments and then JESUS comes. He appears at the last trumpet, the 7th one of Revelation. Read Rev. 11:15-19 and it tells us that is when it will be. We didn’t need to know the day or the hour, we were told to watch the signs and be aware, aware, alert, watching and we were to know the signs of the times.
At that moment in the twinkling of the eye at that last trumpet is when we will join the LORD in the air. That will conclude the tribulation.
THEN, the great tribulation will come right after the church is removed in the form of the last judgments (the bowl/vial judgments). That is the “wrath of GOD”. So, the confusion lies in not knowing the difference between the tribulation and the wrath of GOD.
The church “is not” appointed to the wrath of GOD, so if you and the wife are saved and know the LORD then you will be going up whether you are dead or alive at the appearing of JESUS at that time.
JESUS isn’t going to let us be here for the last 7 judgments for they are only for the unrepentant sinners that didn’t know the LORD and didn’t want to accept His gift of salvation or obey His commands.I really don’t know where to start.
Scripture ( genesis to revelations ) is a parable…
The garden of eden symbolically is the earth.  The two trees symbolically represents the male/female sex. Sin wasn’t in the garden until Adam fell to it. Adam is the tree of life & eve is the tree of knowledge but God is all wisdom. Adam was given dominion over the earth but took of eve.
Matthew 13 wheat & weeds.
Rule/authority.  Satan said His ( its ) throne would be exalted above Gods.
The first example given ( seeing with our spiritual eye ) was Esau & Jacob, But it began with Cain & Able ( unto thee shall be thy desire & thou shall rule over him ).
Lets go with the Jacob & Esau story first. Esau came out hairy & red all over like a garment with the smell of the field ( a woman’s administration,  period or cycle ) but Jacob was a plain man. The powers that be today & since the beginning are feminine or of fertility worship or Gods. Today?  Lady liberty represents the justice system,  statue of liberty represents America ( the whore that sat on many waters ) the 7 points on her crown representing the 7 continents etc. Was not a man to rule the earth? One sat on the clouds Like unto the ( son ) of ( man ) Rev 14:14.
Esau sought to kill His brother.  Esau being referred to as a man. Christ is the Head of man, man is the head of woman,  the woman has no head. Adam ( man ) named the woman ( Woe-man ) not God. Matthew 13 All of it… But its given to you if you will receive it. Matthew 13:24-30 ( see vrs 35 )
In the creation,  Adam slept ( deeply ) while the woman was being made. There’s 3 in the creation. God, the lord God & The lord.
God is spirit, the lord God is a spirit & the lord is a man with the holy spirit.
” Does the word offend you? ” its not mine its His. John 1: 1-11 no one receives Him. It was by their power they couldn’t but by His that it may be fulfilled. Compare the creation of the woman to the tares being sown in the field…Matthew 19:4 he takes credit for all creation ( another parable )
Matthew 19 & 1 Corinthians 7.
Its best a man not marry bc He’s already married to his 1st love.
To even look upon a woman he’s already committed adultery. God reads hearts. But if a man should marry let it be so for 2 become 1 flesh. In the marriage who’s the head. The man or the woman?  The man desires to keep his wife so he pleases her with worldly material.  A man can’t serve 2 masters… why gain the world and loose your own soul, God is really jealous.  the glory of the woman is her hair but the glory of the man is the woman. Who will glorify God then?
Matthew 19:11-12 compared to revelations 14:4… Matthew 19:14 children are innocent,  their not under the law because its not understood by them. Matthew 19:21 after the worldly man kept all of the commandments, when it was told to him to sell all of his goods ( eventually his spouse would leave to ) he walked away sorrowful.
Not implying that we sale our goods to become 1 with God, read the scripture for yourself and let The most High order your steps. Back to Esau,  Jeremiah 49 & the book of obadiah. ( grapes )
Matthew 24:8 birth pains
Matthew 24:19 pregnant & breast feeding.
Revelations 14:15-20 the winepress Is the female body referred to in Matthew 24:19. The rapture of men children out of womb. Its that serious.
John 2:1-10 wine is made from grapes. Jesus says ” what have i to do with thee, my time is not yet come ”
Referencing the future rapture.
9. Referring to the harvest of Matthew 13. The good is saved until last.Cain & Abel: the story of the bible Jesus is more the 2015  years old.
No one never took the time to discover the mysteries,  preaching the word for self righteousness. Cain and Abel is another parable.
Able was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the field.  Put it together,  Esau smelled like the field, was hairy & red all over.
Genesis 4:6-7. 1 of the 2 are to rule over the other. Its been mistaken they are men, brothers or both male sexed.
Able was a keeper of sheep,  Jesus says keep my sheep. Cain offered himself but able offered a sheep, a child from the womb. The story is backwards, a parable, its perfectly so its not understood. Its the little book of revelations John swallows.
Its bitter ( sealed up ) not known. Adam touched Eve. When the blood hit the ( eve was a virgin ) ground,  it called out to God. Cain touched able, when able blood touched the ground it called out to God. We ( humans ) are chains ( great chains binding spirits ) fashioned by God in the earth to bind those he cast down. The human body is a prison. We must be changed to enter heaven.   Like sacrifices throughout the bible,  bloody,  a woman is the same.  She bleeds. The smell goes up as a aroma in the atmosphere but the contents ( plasma ) falls to the earth. Now Lucifer was decked with precious stones as a woman with a beautiful voice but was cast down. God refers to the earth as a woman ( kjv )  Genesis 4:11. Also the earth is referred to as the bottomless pit. It being filled with blood & sin must burn after the rapture.  Then a new heaven & new earth will be made.
Revelations 12:5. Man child to rule.
The scripture is a parable. The times are at the door knocking.
At the blood moon this year as the book of Joel prophesies. Shortly after we’ll see the host of the almighty.
Matthew 24 read the whole character.
Jeremiah 49 read the whole characterNo ” MAN ” is able to read hearts or know another’s faith in the lord. ** these revelations are mine **
* Matthew 24:9 * Some women do believe.No prophet ” well known ” mingled with a woman.  John the Baptist was the greatest prophet to live,  yet He wasn’t married. Paul said: i prefer you be as i am?I not married, i have a girlfriend,  but stopped fornicating ( sexual relations ) when these things started pouring in. Mark of the beast: anybody know the history of the wedding ring? It was worn on the right hand at first.
Ever wondered about the history of the cross? Jesus was nailed to a tree or pole, the cross is idolatry,  The ” t ” was fashioned after tammuz, idol worship.
Closing our prayers with Amen?
Ammon was the God of Pharaoh,  the pharaoh that walked with Joseph. The translation from Egypt to America by the Hand of Alexander the great,  Constantine would later combine all religion into one. A times past, king James along with William Shakespeare gave America its 1st new world religion.  The symbolic for peace would become a ring with a broken cross ( the antichrist been here ) now we wait for a woman woman to rule the  world. As for the church,  Jesus shut up the teachers of the law Matthew 23.
Scribes,  sadducees, Pharisees & elders are the church. The church crucified Jesus & judas betrayed him.
Not 1 person ( of the church or His members ) was crucified with him.
Matthew 24:2 the building ( church ) will be destroyed.  Jesus taught on hills, from the water & in the valley.
The spirit of God itself wouldn’t dwell in buildings,  Solomon being full of wisdom & having all wisdom knew it before he built the temple
1 kings 8:27.
Offerings & collections, what did Jesus teach about the tribute money?
Mind you He turned over the money changers in the temple.
The teachers of the law are to be fed by its flock/sheep, not take up money.
At any time did Jesus receive money?
Did He not tell his disciples to receive no money ( purse or script )? Another parable, Matthew 25:14-30
Vrs 26, some woman will make it.
Vrs 27, of the church he’s collecting but with interest. This servant knew not the lord or the wrath of him, called him wicked and told him ” you could of at least gave it to the church so i could collect with interest.
Moses was a teacher of the law just as the church but by his disobedience wasn’t allowed to enter into the city after all the work he put in to get there. He could see it, but couldn’t enter. Some will see God coming in all his glory but won’t enter into it.Scripture is given in three times
One time in the father
One time in the son
One time in the spirit. I can’t give all times at one time in a post provided there’s not enough space. No man can, im just a man.
To break it down is like having three understandings all in one, no man can accomplish it. Jesus taught we could do many things in his name, he lived for a short while,  most of us are older but no one knows when we will see death. People die daily so obviously we’re not at the point of revelations where we wish for death and will not see it. The human body is the same as a physical temple,  the lord doesn’t dwell in it. It comes & goes.
I’ve had personal dealings with Christians,  they are some of the worst people to deal with yet all fall short of His glory in one way or another. Im not perfect, holy, better then a thief or know everything. My interpretation of the book may be false. Another guy believed Esau to be Caucasians while Jacob was Ethiopian. I searched it out, things fit perfectly together then i dug deeper to come come up with my own opinion.
At the end of the day its just an opinion although God is pouring out His spirit on all believersExcuse any typos
Remain faithful He will show His face.
Im still waiting for personal issues to be revealed.  My girlfriend,  i won’t touch her until i have sold proof marriage to another is His.
The lords prayer is all i pray. Why use another when He reads hearts. Obedience.  Isiah 1, all that other stuff is blocked outUm wow! For one thing, that whole comment was irrelevant to the topic of the article. Second thing, most of the “revelation” you just spoke of is actually your opinion and a perversion of truth.
To name a few, *there is no longer male nor female in Christ Jesus.
*wedding bands couldn’t possibly be the mark because it says “you can’t buy or sell without it”
*The Holy Spirit is not an “it”. He’s a “He”. And He does dwell within men. That’s why were called “temples of the Holy Spirit” and “it is not I who lives but Christ that LIVES IN ME”
*Esau represents the flesh. As he enjoyed being in the world. Jacob represents the Holy Spirit. The name literally means “to take the place if another” and He took took the place of Jesus, if you will, once Jesus ascended to The Father. Also, it says Jacob enjoyed dwelling in tents. Paul says our present bodies are tents.
*marriage is not a sin or looked down upon by God. It is a holy and sanctified bond ordained by God Himself. Our marriages are a reflection of our relationship with Jesus.You are right that there is revelation all throughout the bible. But that doesn’t make every story a parable.Praise you Lord Jesus for you many Blessings. Bless those who Stand Up for your Word Oh Lord.  Salt & Light, is absolutely correct in Knowledge of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit…I felt a very Strange Feeling in My Heart as I was Reading “Bucks” Interpretation of Scripture. as a matter of fact I was horrified. I Pray that “Buck” may find the Truth, which is the True Gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen!keep up the good work. You are teaching it right in order. All they have to do is read the Bible follow follow your lead.When Israel left Egypt, there were 3 trumpet blast. First to let everyone know to get ready to move, second to give a few minutes until we march,third was to begin to march. Could this be the last trump since we are leaving.I know we are living, in the last days. The day of the LORD, IS NEAR. BE READY, FOR OUR TIME IS SHORT. COME LORD JESUS COME & COME QUICKLY.The promise of the catching up of the church.is fast upon us stand ye in the Holy place Amen….I believe shadrack meshack & abednigo being thrown in the fiery Furness is a example of how god will protect his people from harm. Amen…I disagree with Irvin Baxter.  The trumpet on 1 Cor 15:51 and the 7th trumpet in Revelation isn’t the same!
The one in 1 Cor 15 is a shofar trump and the 7th trumpet in Rev is a silver trumpet.  As you can study, they are two different events.
The trumpet in 1 Cor. happens during the Feast of Trumpets during the Fall season. On that day, 100 trumps are blown and the very last one, the 100th trump is when the rapture is going to happen some year. Hopefully this year.
The 7th trumpet in Rev is a silver one and when a silver trumpet is used is usually for judgement.
So, keep an eye on events unfolding this year, specially on September 15th, 2015 which the 100th trump will be blown around 6:45 pm. Hopefully this date will be the rapture year.
Oh, and in case you mentioned that NO ONE knows the day or the time and not even Jesus knows it, then answer this. How come Paul knows that the rapture will happen at the Last Trump?? How come he knows about that detail?
That phrase Jesus used is an idiom Jews used to refer about the Feast of Trumpets, which is another name they used for that festivity.Eduardo, the Greek word “Salphinx” is the word used for trumpet and for trump in NT. There is no distinction at all so your attempt to distinguish the two has no basis in scripture. Every trump and trumpet mentioned in NT is the same.Amen! come Lord Jesus.Jesus said “as in the days of Noah”. We know from the Bible that Noah and his family, by God’s command, were inside the Ark, 7 days before the flood. This indicates that rapture shall take place before 7 years tribulationWhen Jesus said “as in the days of Noah,” He wasn’t saying that everything which happened in Noah’s time will happen in our time. Jesus is simply explaining the suddenness of His coming by comparing it to the suddenness of the flood. The flood came unexpectedly to those who weren’t waiting for it, and the Second Coming will come unexpectedly to those who are not waiting for it.He gave Noah warning, i believe that we will be raptured and changed for the coming battle Before the 7 years. I believe we will be fighting the Heavenly war, while the world fights the World war… My beliefCan you provide scripture to support your arguments?Don’t we have to be born again to go in the rapture? Repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and be filled with the Holy Ghost with the evidence of tongues?  And living a holy life?  Just wondering. Do you teach the Brother Baxter?Yes, that is all correct.John….did you moderate out a comment of mine about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit ? If so I’m curious why…I don’t think I did.I never heard it was a requirement that you must speak in tongues to be a born again Christian.I heard Mr.Billy Graham say that he did not have the gift of speaking in tongues and I am very sure he is a born-again Christian.Can you explain that?Prophecy is more important than speaking in tongues. That is in scripture, just not exactly sure where but an Endtime staffer would know. I do not think it’s required.Hi…the answer is simple…After His recurrection Jesus ‘breathed’ on all his living disciples (i.e. not including Judas) – this is the initial receiving of the Holy Spirit for salvation. However there is a 2nd and subsequent receiving of the Holy Spirit for power to moreeffectively witness (including power gifts and other gifts of the Spirit including ‘tongues’). Now God wants all His children to have this latter infilling which includes a personal gift of tongues to build ourselves up. However the comparison of tongues and prophecy is in the context of the CORPORATE gift of tongues where tongues + interpretation = prophecy therefor IN THIS CONTEXT ALONE, prophecy is greater than tongues since in benefits the body of Christ more but the personal gift of tongues builds us up inwardly as individuals…..make sense ?two more things…God does want all His children to receive the 2nd and subsequent ‘baptism’ of the Holy Spirit but not all will….it often takes a greater level of engagement and faith to receive this…..still saved though just not as effective. Also everyone can potentially have the personal gift of tongues (i.e. if they have the BoHS) but very few will give an utterance in tongues in a corporate setting (which God intends to follow with an interpretation).Are you suggesting that it is difficult to receive the Holy Ghost?John…not at all difficult to receive the Holy Spirit for salvation. It’s just the later baptism for power and witness that can be more problematic for some. Common obstacles are: lack of desire and hunger, theological bias/preconception, fear. God never overrides free will.Otherwise He is all to ready to give this if we are fully open to it.Gotcha!Acts 16:31God has given us different gifts. Not everyone will speak in tongues.Hi, just a note, the tribes in matthew 24 refer to Israel. The church is removed in the rapture and Israel are the tribes whom face the tribulation. This is the fifullment of God’s covanant with Israel in Deuteronomy.Shelly, if this is true, why are there all these “saints” in the tribulation and what about all those souls in heaven who came out of the great tribulation? Believers = church so if there are believers alive during the tribulation dos that not mean the church is there?I invite all to read “Famous Rapture Watchers” on Joe Ortiz’ “End Times Passover” blog of May 5, 2014.  It reveals the only “rapture” view held by Christians before 1830!Yes, but they also never believed Israel would be re-created either.Are you referring to the NATION of Israel or to THE ISRAEL OF GOD?  [Gal. 3:26-29; Lk. 3:8; Gal. 6:15-16; Rom. 9:6-8; Rom. 9:27; Rom. 10:1; Rom.11:5, 14, 25-26Yes!  A very good read.I want to learn more, I’m ChristianStudy the Word of God only and pray before reading, asking God to reveal His TRUTH to you.  Ask Him, in Jesus Name, to give you an insatiable desire to read His Word.  Don’t believe anything you hear or read from men or women unless it lines up perfectly with God’s Word.Watch these videos to save your life. We have decoded the Bible. As a result we have known the future.
 There’ll be the last judgment in 2016.
 Great plague and great famine will start in July 2016.
 Most earthlings will be killed in the tribulation. After that, antichrist or satanic alien group will come down.
 But the Rapture is supposed to happen from March to June in 2016 before the tribulation.
 You are going to have to call Angels’ UFOS and fly away to redeem your life.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoWChbXNpNY&list=PLcHMddptR7S7hbK24IRRxVpqaL6C0BTjwhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3FYWdrUg3tUZ7J8R3oD8A/videoshttp://asarinisei.wix.com/asari-decodes-propI disagree.  Beware of date setting.Im happy im saved so i don’t have to go through the tribulation but the fact i really don’t know when gets me nervous and almost scared cause ive never really been anywhere in my life or really have done thingsYou need to get yourself a bible if you don’t have one. You need to study it. Just b/c you are saved “does not” mean that you won’t go through the tribulation. JESUS isn’t coming until after the 7th Trumpet. You will find that verse in Rev. 11:15-19. It tells us that is just prior to the “wrath” of GOD. The tribulation and the “wrath of GOD” are two different things. Like apples and oranges, just not the same.
The Church is going through the tribulation, there is no way out of that, until the7th trumpet. So the believe is therefore called pre-wrath rapture of the church. The rapture (the catching away) will happen just prior to the last 7 judgments. They are only for the unrepentant sinners and the church is not subject to them. We are NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD.
Study to show yourself approved. The LORD wants your obedience which is where you obtain your salvation from.Good job Wandakate!The rapture will be heart pounding event to everyone. Do worry, just know Jesus will comfort us! 🙂Jesus doesn’t return until the seventh trump.  There are many places in the Bible that states this fact.  We do have to go through the tribulation, but take heart.  God tells us that his children who repent, accept His son as our Savior, and follow His Word as closely as we can (only Jesus was perfect in the flesh), will be saved.  God promises that no harm will come to His children who are righteous.  Do not be afraid.  The yearnings of the flesh are nothing compared to the glory of God’s Kingdom.  Study the scriptures, pray for understanding, and let Father know that you love him.  God Bless.Our salvation is based on our obedience. “If you love me, keep my commandments said the LORD”…Interesting wandakate i thought my salvation was based on what Jesus did at the cross.In Matthew chapter 13, Jesus said the wheat and tares (the righteous & the wicked) will GROW TOGETHER  UNTIL THE HARVEST (vs. 30) and that THE HARVEST IS THE END OF THE WORLD (vs. 30).    In Matthew 13:40-43, the tares (wicked) are gathered together and thrown into the fire at the END OF THE WORLD and THEN shall THE RIGHTEOUS SHINE forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.   The righteous will shine in their “glorified bodies”.  Compare the following verses: [ Phil. 3:20-21; Col. 3:4; 1 Jn. 3:2; Psa. 17:15; Rom. 8:18-23;
Daniel chapter twelve is also in view of “THE END OF THE WORLD”.  In verses 2 & 3, we see the resurrection of the dead ,at which time THE RIGHTEOUS SHINE.  The Apostle Paul said that all who are in Christ will be made alive at His coming and “THEN COMETH THE END” (1 Cor 15:22-24).
1 Corinthians 15:25 tells us that Christ MUST REIGN TILL He has put all enemies under His feet.  Acts 3:20-21 tells us that heaven MUST RECEIVE Jesus Christ until the “RESTUTION OF ALL THINGS” which speaks of heaven and earth passing away and a NEW EARTH as recorded in Revelation chapter  21:1.  In verse 4 God wipes away all tears and there shall be NO MORE DEATH, and in verse 5, God said, “Behold, I MAKE ALL THINGS NEW”.
Revelation chapter 21:1-5 agrees with 1 Corinthians chapter 15 wherein the Apostle Paul said “all who are in Christ will be MADE ALIVE “AT HIS COMING and THEN COMETH THE END.  (vs. 22-24).  He said that at the last trump the dead shall be raised incorruptible and We shall be CHANGED … and DEATH will be swallowed up in victory.
The beautiful harmony of God’s Word is seen in the following Scriptures:
Job 14:12-15 {in part].  “…man lieth down, and RISETH NOT: TILL THE HEAVENS BE NO MORE …  If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait till MY CHANGE come.
2 Peter3:10-13 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the HEAVENS SHALL PASS AWAY with A GREAT NOISE, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, THE EARTH ALSO and the works that are therein SHALL BE BURNED UP. 11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the HEAVENS BEING ON FIRE shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
Jeremiah25:31 A NOISE shall come EVEN TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are WICKED to THE SWORD, saith the LORD.
Hebrews4:12 {in part} For THE WORD OF GOD is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any TWO EDGED SWORD.
Revelation19:15 And OUT OF HIS MOUTH goeth a SHARP SWORD, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
John12:48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not MY WORDS, hath one that JUDGETH him: THE WORD that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in THE LAST DAY.
John6:39-40 And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should RAISE IT UP again at THE LAST DAY. 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I WILL RAISE HIM UP at THE LAST DAY.Well thank you for going to the trouble of typing all of that for the readers here. It certainly doesn’t appear as if there is going to be a pre-tribulation rapture does it? No, He said that the ones who persevere until the end will be save. He said, the ones that make it will be the ones that obey the LORD and did His commandments.WHY PRETRIB RAPTUREEzekiel   is only one preaching the first 3.5 yrs.     the other is Enoch        “for it is appointed unto man once to die …….”half the world would be flying to Jerusalem to see him and Enoch   if christians were still aroundholy spirit taken out so only witnesses around to preach.  Enoch and Ezekiel still haven’t died.wouldn’t go up at Armageddon to come right back downno one knows but the father         if it was at end of 7 yrs.,  we would know within a few hrs. because we will  know when the tribulation startsTO IRWIN				per Perry Stone, grant Jeffries, Hal Lindsey, ………..holy spirit gone  with the christians to heaven at the beginning of tribulation    that’s why hell breaks loose   no salt of the earth anymoremarriage of the lamb / supper  happens in between christs’ appearanceschristians   back down to the earth in second coming. Christ in the clouds at the rapture  only.   Not at Armageddon.both spoken of in different contexts   in the bible              ( rapture / second coming)brought back down at Armageddon   ( you wouldn’t go up to come right back down)like Noah’s ark    christians delivered first  christians won’t be in the tribulation because the church age ends at the beginning of it.                more to come    ….T. so many errors.
1) Where does it say specifically that HS is removed? That scripture says that the antichrist (man of perdition) cannot be revealed until the “restrainer” is taken out of the way. So theologians, wanting to promote a pre-trib rapture, claim that the “restrainer” must be restraining evil (scripture does not say that) and so it must be either the HS, or the church, or governments that are removed. Some of the theologians you cite say it is the church and some say it is the HS but both are assumptions based on an assumption. No scripture ever says either the church or the HS is removed.
2) I assume you are saying that the two witnesses are Ezekiel and Enoch? Since Revelation does not identify them, anything is an assumption. Scripture does describe the two as 2 olive branches which most people believe this means they are Jews. If this is true, Enoch would not qualify because he was not a Jew.
3) The 2 witnesses are part of the 1st resurrection at the 7th trumpet. They go up with the righteous and return with the armies of heaven following Jesus to Armageddon to defeat the antichrist. Scripture never claims they go up to heaven at Armageddon. You seem to have that right so I guess you are claiming that Post tribbers claim this. If some do they are in error.
4) Show me in scripture where it says the church age ends before the Tribulation. Read Matt. 24:29-31. Cannot be any clearer than that. Now I know you will tell me that the church is not mentioned after Rev. 3 so it must be gone. Church is mentioned in Rev. 22 plus the saints are mentioned 13 times including those who did not take the mark of the beast so they go through the tribulation. Saints = believers = church. The church is not divided so unless you can find a scripture that shows a “church A” that is raptured before the tribulation and a “Church B” raptured after the tribulation, maybe you ought to stick with the words of Jesus in Matt. 24.
Don’t listen to others, read it for yourself and pray for guidance. It will come.Michael the Archangel is the guardian of the church and in my opinion he is the restrainer. When he is told to step aside then things start happening.
JESUS appears at the last trumpet of Revelation (the 7th one). This is during the wrath of satan. The church is here during the tribulation b/c it says that the antichrist comes to make “war” with the “saints”. They had to be here or he couldn’t be making war with them and tormenting them and killing them.
The book of Revelation is not in chronological order. The saints and the church are mentioned after chapter 3. Most Christians think the church is gone at chapter 3 and that isn’t the case.
JESUS appears at the 7th trumpet, not before and not after. Read Rev. 11:15-19 and it tells you all about it. If you have believed anything else then you have been misled and deceived.
Satan is the god of this world at the present time and he will continue to be right through until the last trumpet when JESUS CHRIST will take over the world from him. The graves will open, the people will be judged, and even the Ark of the Covenant (Testament) will be seen at that time. How can Christians not see what is in plain sight word for word?
One of the first things JESUS told His disciples in Matthew 24 was…”Do not be deceived”.I had not thought of Michael as the restrainer. Another good possibility, proving again that because the scripture doesn’t tell us who it is, we can speculate but we cannot know. Hence, to base a theory of the rapture on one opinion or another (pre-trib) is just silly.It’s very simple (to me) when the rapture will be. We must let the scriptures speak to us, and Rev. 11:15-19 tells me that JESUS is appearing right then (at the 7th Trumpet), and at that time He will take possession of this evil world away from satan (who is now the god of this world). Satan is in charge here until JESUS comes.
The Ark of the Covenant will be seen it tells us, and the graves will even open at that time. How much plainer could it be. We don’t need to know the day or the hour, it’s not relevant, what we were supposed to watch for were the signs of the times. We were told to be on guard, the watchman on the wall, to be alert, awake, aware of what exactly was going on so we could warn others.
The majority of the church is deceived. It’s a PRE-WRATH rapture of the church. It’s after satan’s wrath and just before the wrath of GOD (the last 7 Bowl judgments). It doesn’t get any plainer than that. Those who don’t see this, don’t want to.wandakate:  I’m inclined to agree with you.  Michael IS constantly fighting evil.  But, like Curt said, we do not know for sure.  Blessings…t, you haven’t offered a scripture, chapter or verse, to back up what you are saying.  It is all guess work and speculation.  Mr. Irvin Baxter is backing up his word with the scripture.  The Bible is the final word on the subject.  Better read it again.Thank You Jesus.
Yours teachings are awesome, everything explaining with proof, amazing things i learnt from your ministry. I am from India, working in Duabi-UAE.To Kenneth Thomas. Your post about being a post-trib person in a pre-trib church is a more common occurrence than you might imagine. Let me offer this advise. Don’t pursue a frontal attack. Get all your facts and scriptures firmly planted in your mind and then when some one states a pre-trib position say ” well if that is true, how do we deal with this” and give them your scripture. Another great come back is “it doesn’t say that” when they give interpretation as scripture. Most pre-trib arguments are assumptions based on assumptions and twisted interpretations which for the intellectually honest can be changed but it is so ingrained in most preachers it is hard to have a serious discussion. For you as a pastor understand that to mislead the flock may well condemn many to hell when they wake up and realize they are in the tribulation,  have been mislead and find they must take the mark to feed their family. The mark is a death sentence. You must be accurate and explain God’s word as He wrote it not as we want it. Stay strong.It’s not either one. JESUS will appear at the 7th trumpet (of Revelation). It’s a PRE-WRATH rapture, not pre-trib, mid-trib, or post-trib…It happens just prior to the last 7 judgments which are the Bowl judgments. The others are the wrath of satan upon the Christians who will be persecuted for their faith in JESUS. Then the wrath of GOD comes but not until all 7 of the other Trumpet judgments are over with.
Many people are deceived. Hope this helps. Read it and you’ll see where JESUS appears and what happens when He does. Rev. 11:15-19.What do you think of Luke 12:36?  Luk 12:36  And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. I think we all agree Jesus is coming back just once, and that He is returning from heaven.  If both of those are true, and Luke 12:36 is true, He is also returning from a wedding.  That being said, the church has to be taken up before the 2nd coming in order for the wedding to take place.  That doesn’t mean the rapture of the church is before the 7 years, it just means it is before the 2nd coming.  There is no explaining it away.  But I have never had a post tribber give me any explanation for that verse that doesn’t essentially say that we can’t take it literal.Wandakate and I seem to have a difference without a distinction. Let me clarify my understanding of Scripture. The Great tribulation is 3 1/2 years long and includes to ministry of the 2 witnesses who are called UP to the clouds at the 1st resurrection when the dead in Christ arise and we who are still alive are caught up. This is at the 7th trumpet. The 1st resurrection has all believers in their resurrected bodies meeting Jesus in the clouds (check all rapture related scriptures to confirm this). We all then go with Christ to the marriage supper where He is married to His bride “the new Jerusalem”. While the supper is proceeding the wicked experience the 7 bowls of wrath as wandakate points out. Following that Jesus brings the armies of heaven back to earth to fight the battle of Armageddon and set up His kingdom. This is the sequence outlined in scripture. How long there is between the rapture and the second coming we really don’t know only that the rapture is at the 7th trumpet which is at the end of the tribulation and before the outpouring of the wrath in the 7 bowls. Hope this helps.Did you hear all walmart’s and 0ver 200 major stores are going under ground. Obama going to issue the mark and the beast on  Dec 21 2015, and a major earth quake is going to emerge in southern calif. I found these all online. How true do you think this all of this is? and do you  think it will happen,from the word of gods perspective?. Can you please try to answer these questions on your next show? Thank you Larry your viewer.I am really perplexed by all of this. Or please e- mail.me thank you.Larry, all these things are of this world, but set your eyes on Jesus. Try to remember that God is still in control. Everything that happens here, he allows.  He will use it ultimately for His purpose. We are not of this world anymore.  Jesus will never leave you……so fear not! What is the worst that can happen? Paradise.Kind of like that preacher who said the world was going to end on December 22 several years ago? Look on the bright side. If you are right, you needn’t buy any Christmas presents. Save your money because clothes are in short supply in Hades.What is the latest on the Peace agreement. I see the gays boosting in the street, natural disasters, what’s next. I just try to be ready and the more I do the more I have to pray against fire-y darts and I do! It works too…“Boosting in the street?” Did they use booster seats?Apparently he meant to say BOASTING!!!Look to the days of Lot to see what comes next. The attack / villification / persecution / attempted corruption / killing of the righteous followed by fire and brimstone on the wicked. We’ll not be spared the former (Satan’s wrath) but we will the latter (God’s wrath). Christians will soon be seen as the villains of the peace for daring to oppose the status quo (or the few that will).God and the Bible will be deemed redundant and man with his perverted ways will deem himself god and master of his own destiny. Well did Isaiah say ‘Woe to those who call good evil and evil good’………The UK’s shields are already lowered due to it’s people re-electing a government which steam-rollered in gay marriage. Watch out America…just because people suddenly decide it’s all ok doesn’t mean God will go along with it….You are so right about the rapture timing. It’s after the “wrath” of satan, at the 7th trumpet, but before the “wrath” of GOD, the last 7, the Bowl judgments.
It’s a PRE-WRATH rapture of the church.
Happens just prior to the “wrath” of GOD. However, most Christians don’t know this, they hold onto their pre-tribulation theory. They won’t be prepared at all for what is coming on them, they will be lost. Why is that? Because they’ve been deceived. They’ve listened to the “feel good” gospel preachers and not studied to show themselves approved. JESUS wanted us to watch out and not be deceived.
So, I’m glad you have the truth, most people do not.We are coming very close to the Phrophecy of Ezekial 38 and 39.  Israel will attack Iran’s nuclear facility and that will be the Hook in the Jaw that Ezekial fortold of and will cause Russia and all the Arab Spring Nation’s Libiya, Egypt, Ethiopia, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Palinstine to come to the Mountain’s of Israel to destroy God’s People Israel.  None of Israel’s allies will come to Her aid, but God Almighty will destroy the entire Armies of the Enimies of Israel.  It will take Seven month’s to bury the dead and will cause fear of a World War that will usher in the Anti-Christ whom will bring Peace by signing a Seven year Peace treaty with Israel.  We are witnessing the beginning of the End of Day’s.  Look up for your Redeemtion is Nye.To Shelly and others regarding the timelines of Revelation and the rapture. Revelation is a series of visions. John is moved from one vision to another and you can tell the transition by the words “after this” or “after these things”. Each vision is separate and has it’s on timeline. Take Rev. 11 & 12. 11 introduces the 2 witnesses who prophesy for 1260 days (3 1/2 yrs). This chronologically comes between the 6th and 7th trumpet if you go by chapters and verses (these chapter and verse numbers were added much later and are not part of original texts). The very next chapter deals with the nation of Israel and this timeline spans from before the birth of Christ through the tribulation where she hides for 1260 days. Timing is difficult but is not chronological.
To decipher the truth on the rapture, you need to have each person who supports a theory to lay out the specific scriptures that support their theory and explain how that scripture supports it. Analyze what they say and underline anywhere assumptions or interpretations are given. If your scripture has to be explained to be understood, be suspect. Then make each person rebut the scripture of the other theories. Here you will see some pained explanations. Jesus says He comes for His elect “After the tribulation” and Paul says the rapture is “at the last trump” and the last trumpet of the bible is the 7th trumpet of Revelation.Bringing us to a PRE-WRATH rapture of the church. JESUS appearing at the 7th trumpet, just prior to the bowl judgments (the last set of 7).
Since the church is not appointed to the wrath of GOD the church is removed before the wrath of GOD which is going to be the last 7 judgments (the Bowl/Vial) judgments.
JESUS comes and takes possession of the earth from satan at the last trumpet. The graves are opened, the people are judged, the Ark of the Covenant is seen. It all happens right then.
Rev. 11:15-19.wandakate:  What “Ark of the Covenant” is seen?  Blessings…How many of them do you think there are? The Ark of the Testament and the Ark of the Covenant all one and the same.I believe there are 2 Arks.  The Ark of the OT and the Ark of the NT.What is the ark of the NT?The Ark contains the two tablet’s and was housed in the Most Holy compartment; called the Sanctuary. When Jesus our High priest is finished the doors are open and the Ark is seen. Why? Judgment is done. Jesus want’s us to understand the importance of His unchangeable Law. O and Noah’s Ark I guess can be said to two ways Ark is used. Interesting as the Ark saved 8 souls and destruction to everyone outside of it. And Jesus did say our days will come on us no different then Noah’s day. So what I’m saying is when this happens and the Ark is seen then destruction is to follow after…We all need to educate ourselves as to what the Mark of the beast is, and how to avoid it. Are you sure you will be gone before that time? In case not we should have something to fall back on, or a back up plan…Would you tell me why you are not on tv ch 2 in tampa bay anymore?  My wife told so many people about you and your program, and now they cannot see it anymore. ThanksWhat do you think of Luke 12:36?Luk 12:36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.I think we all agree Jesus is coming back just once, and that He is returning from heaven. If both of those are true, and Luke 12:36 is true, He is also returning from a wedding. That being said, the church has to be taken up before the 2nd coming in order for the wedding to take place.That doesn’t mean the rapture of the church is before the 7 years, it just means it is before the 2nd coming. There is no explaining it away. But I have never had a post tribber give me any explanation for that verse that doesn’t essentially say that we can’t take it literal.Jason I guess our agreement would be based on your definition of “coming”. In Matt.24 and 1 Cor. and 2 Thess. we see Jesus “coming” in the clouds but in Rev.19 we see Jesus “coming” back to earth on a white horse to fight the battle of Armageddon and set up His kingdom. So if you define the “2nd coming ” as when Jesus returns physically to earth then we do agree but if you are trying to lump the rapture/1st resurrection with the 2nd coming I would not agree. The rapture/1st resurrection occurs at the 7th trumpet of Revelation which is at the end of the tribulation. The 2nd coming to earth occurs some time later after the 7 bowls of wrath are poured out. This timing (between the 2) is up for debate but that there are 2 events is not, it is clearly scriptural. Hope this helps.I think we can add a 1,000 years in there…would that work. An appearing to call up the church, to open up the graves and call the remainder of those alive up. He will not touch the ground at that time. He will appear in the clouds, with His multitude of Angels from heaven. The church will put on their new glorified bodies and go with JESUS.
Then I believe the bowl judgments will fall on the sinners. We will be with JESUS for 1,000 years and then we will come back with Him after that to the earth to fight the battle at Armageddon. This time He will ride to earth on a white horse with a host of His saints from heaven with Him where they were already with Him. Everybody comes in on horses and that is when satan will be thrown into the bottomless pit with the false prophet, the antichrist and all sinners including all of satan’s demons. That is what hell will consist of ALL EVIL!
JESUS will concur the entire world. AmenHe will win the victory is what I was trying to say. I am half asleep as it is after midnite. Please excuse any spelling mistakes, so sorry.Hello Pastor Baxter, Love your program. I’m writing a fictional series based on the Pre-Wrath Theory, so your sermons have been very helpful. I’m curious, are you saying that you believe in Post-Trib? Or is your opinion somewhere between Pre-Wrath theory and the Post -Trib view? I’ve been watching your show for a couple of months now, and don’t miss a program.
Thank you, from a new fan of yours.Judy, I have never seen Irvin reply so I will add one opinion for you to consider. A true post-trib view is a pre-wrath view because the rapture at the end of the tribulation (7th trumpet) occurs before the outpouring of the 7 bowls of wrath so no inconsistency between the two. The problem comes in when you overlap the bowls with the trumpets which I believe is unscriptural.Thank you, Curt, for replying to my comment. After researching the subject, I’m under the opinion that Post-Tribulationists believe that the Rapture will not occur until the end of the Seven Year Tribulation, just prior to the beginning of the Millennial Kingdom and that Pre-Wrath-Tribulationist believe that the Rapture will occur beyond the mid-point of the Great Tribulation. That it will occur right after the 7th Trumpet (Satan’s wrath), but before the 7 bowls (God’s wrath).Hello, Curt, I need to make a correction on my last comment about Pre-Wrath. It should have read: The Rapture will occur right after the last seal (not the trumpet). Instead, God’s Wrath begins with the Trumpet Judgments. Sorry about the error.Judy, How do you conclude that the rapture occurs at the 7th seal? If Rev. clearly says that the bowls/vials are “filled with the wrath of God” how do you conclude that the trumpet judgments are also?Your correction is NOT correct. The seals and trumpets are the wrath of satan and that is the “tribulation”.
The wrath of GOD is the bowl judgments (the last 7). The rapture of the church is at the 7th trumpet, not the 7th seal! Remember…In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye at the LAST TRUMPET.
NOT at the last seal judgment.
That is NOT biblical at all. No foundation there sorry. We are all here until the 7th trumpet. The church leaves the earth just prior to the bowl judgments which are the wrath of GOD and thus the great tribulation. It’s a PRE-WRATH rapture.Do you believe that the rapture is the time when Jesus comes “as a thief in the night”?Hi Judy let me give you some more data. The Great tribulation begins when the peace treaty is broken (no where is there a “tribulation period of 7 years). This point is in the middle of Daniel’s 70th week which is where we get the interpretation that there is a 7 year tribulation. The antichrist comes to power at the breaking of this treaty and rules for 3 1/2 years. The two witnesses appear here and they witness for 42 months or 3 1/2 years. (the same 3 1/2 years) The two witnesses are called up to heaven at the sounding of the 7th trumpet and since we know they minister for 3 1/2 years we now know that this is at the end of the Great Tribulation. The bowls of wrath are poured out after the 7th trumpet and so after the Great tribulation which is why I say a proper post trib belief is also a pre-wrath belief. Hope this helps.Curt, may I ask you what position do you agree with? Pre, Mid or Post?Judy I have commented on this in the past and if you look at Rev 16:14-16 you’ll see a clear indication that His people are to continue watching out for him even at the 6th bowl (the 6th bowl is the gathering of the wicked for Armageddon which from the parable of the tares  takes place BEFORE the gathering of the wheat  (even if it completes just moments before). In addition If you look through bowls 4 &5 you’ll see last gasp calls for repentance (no point in offering it if it’s genuine) – now we know there’s no chance of repentance after the rapture so the rapture must occur AFTER bowls 4-5. Question is how can God’s people be around part way through the wrath ? Easy….His wrath (bowls 1-5) is specifically focussed on the beast and his kingdom and so His people are preserved from it.sorry…meant to say NOT genuine……and how do we know there’s no repentance after the rapture ? Just refer to the parable of the 10 virgins and Noah’s ark…If you are writing about Pre-Wrath then you are spot on b/c that is what it is. There is no pre-trib or mid-trib or even post-trib. NONE of those are biblical. Pre-wrath is the only one that makes pure biblical sense. The others don’t have any foundation.
Satan’s wrath (the persecution of Christians) is going to be the tribulation, and everybody is here for all of that just as John has just told us a few comments back. Then at the 7th trumpet that is when JESUS appears in the clouds and removes the Church from the earth and raises the dead from their graves. All of them according to scripture were sleeping. They WERE NOT in heaven as yet, as many people believe, they were actually in their graves waiting on that 7th trumpet to sound.
JESUS comes (Rev. 11:15-19) and takes possession of the earth at the 7th trumpet. He will have a host of His heavenly Angels with Him, an entire multitude of them. His feet will not touch the ground. He isn’t coming with saints as we think, but with Angels.The wrath of GOD is the bowl judgments (the last 7). They are going to fall on all of the unrepentant sinners. Those who never confessed their sins, didn’t repent of them and didn’t forsake them. They NEVER loved JESUS.
They will suffer those judgments, all those listed in the Bible that won’t make it will suffer the worst of it all.
We are here for those seals and all of the trumpets. Scripture says we will be persecuted. JESUS also told us that we would be for His sake.
He said, “IF you follow me, you will suffer persecution”, b/c He did the same. “If they have persecuted me (JESUS said), they will do the same to you”.
The Church is NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD and they are only the last 7 judgments. Most people think we are out of here for all of the judgments, and that is not true. They are deceived by false pastors (prophets). The wrath of satan and the wrath of GOD are two different things.I think that it’s simply a matter of semantics. In my mind, pre-wrath rapture and post-trib rapture are the same. When I say that the resurrection will take place after the tribulation, I am not implying that the church will be subject to God’s wrath.I understand. Yes after the tribulation but before the wrath of GOD which the church isn’t appointed to. So that would be the same as Pre-Wrath.
It’s not pre-trib and it’s not mid-trib and it can be called post-trib or pre-wrath. Either or I suppose…I think the only difference between you and I is our understanding of what “immediately after the tribulation” means. In our understanding, the church will be on the earth during that time that God’s wrath is being poured out. We obviously wont be subject to the wrath of God, but it will be poured out while we are here. Take a look at Revelation 16:15.To JOHN: The appearing of JESUS in the clouds is the rapture of the church. That is going to happen at the 7th trumpet. The church will be removed at that time, and we WILL NOT be here for the bowl judgments. They are going to fall on the unrepentant sinners ONLY, not anybody else. There is a removal (a catching up) of the saints right before the wrath of GOD (the last 7 judgments)…Is a great message and it is true Jesus is soon coming.John, Endtime Staffer:  We know that the Ark of the Covenant in the OT carried the Manna, Arron’s Staff and the 10 Commandments.  The 10 Commandments being the Word of God in “writing.”  In the NT, we have a “new” covenant, Jesus.  If the OT Ark carried the OT Covenant, 10 commandments (Word of God in writing), Catholics believe that the NT Ark is Mary, as she carried the NT Covenant (Jesus) IN THE FLESH.  That is why Catholics believe that the Ark that John saw in the Temple was Mary, as like I said, she carried the NT Word of God “in the Flesh.  Now, if John said he saw the Ark of the Covenant in the Temple, we are all on the edge of our seat, waiting for him to describe it.  And to our surprise, in Rev. 12:1, John describes a woman, not a box.  The Bible tells us that Jeremiah hid the OT Ark when they were being invaded so that it would not be destroyed or carried away.  To my knowledge, the OT Ark has still not been found, so it can’t possibly be in the Heavenly Temple.  There would be no reason for God to rapture/resurrect the OT Ark, as the “new Covenant” (Jesus) already sits at His right Hand in Heaven.  The only ones interested in  finding the OT Ark are the Jews, as they will not accept Jesus as the NT Covenant. (I am not talking about Messianic Jews) Catholics also believe that Mary also represents Israel and is also symbolic as the Mother of the New Covenant Church.  Thanks for asking, John.  Peace.So this is to say all Christians will have to go through the tribulation before Jesus Christ returns for His people, or do I have that wrongYes, all living Christians will go through the tribulation.Yes, everybody is here for the wrath of satan the tribulation. We are not however going to be here for the wrath of GOD. JESUS is going to appear at the 7th Trumpet (Rev. 11:15-19). He will take possession of this world right then from satan. He will call up the dead from their graves where they have been all along sleeping. He will rapture the living up into the clouds to meet Him in the air. We will then be changed at that moment in the twinkling of an eye at the “last” trumpet.
We will put on our glorified bodies. These corrupt bodies will not be suitable for the Kingdom of GOD. We will change from moral to immortal and from corrupt to incorruptible just like that.
We will meet JESUS in the air and He is coming with a host of His heavenly Angels to get His bride (the church).
John…Where on the timetable are we now? Are we into the Trumpet judgments yet?
I heard we are at the 5th, but that may not be correct. Would you asked Irvin and let me know.
I will look for your reply, thanks, WKI agree with everything that you wrote!Irvin believes that we are in the 6th trumpet era. In other words, 5 of the trumpets have sounded and we are waiting for the sounding of the 6th (WW3).Thank you so much. I am so happy that you are in agreement with me and that Irvin must also be which warms my heart that I am proclaiming the truth to the people. Many people read what is written on these websites and I am so happy to have been given the wisdom and knowledge that I have so I can discern the truth from the false doctrine.
I know WWIII is on it’s way so I guess that event will signal in the 6th trumpet. It doesn’t give us a lot of time does it?
GOD has His plan and JESUS will appear when GOD is ready and not when these pre-tribbers are ready. Unfortunately they are just deceived by the preachers that are preaching this pre-trib doctrine which has no foundation whatsoever in scripture.
Thanking GOD for the truth that He has let us know. This truth “must” be shared. Time is short. Satan is busy 24/7 so Christians must also be busy getting out the truth to these untold masses of souls.
They need to listen up and take that spiritual blindfold off their eyes so they can see the truth before it’s too late for them.
Amen, and thank you one more time. PTL.John:  I totally agree but I secretly hope that the pre-tribbers are right.  I’m not looking forward to the tribulation.  Things will get very ugly, but, as we all know, we win in the end.Thanks for the truth…many believe they will be gone before anything bad happens. No antichrist, no mark, no new world order, no One World Religion (organized by the current Pope) and no One World Government. They are deceived and in for a huge wake up call. JESUS isn’t coming until the 7th trumpet and that is the tribulation. The great tribulation will follow that and it will be the wrath of GOD. And the church is not appointed to the wrath of ALMIGHTY GOD. We are however going to suffer through part of the tribulation until the 7th trumpet. People need to read Revelation where it tells us about all of those judgments so they will know which ones we will be here for and which one we will be gone for. JESUS is coming for us before the last 7 judgments. In the meantime we must be purified. He is looking for a spotless bride.
There is no escape route as many believe. It was just all part of that feel good gospel…I forgot to add the passage for the rapture-catching away which is Rev. 11:15-19. JESUS comes then at the 7th trumpet and not before that.
Remember, “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, when? at the last trumpet” !John…Where do the 1,000 years fall in here?The Millennial reign of Jesus Christ begins immediately after the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 20:1-4).So, after we’ve been caught up by Jesus after tribulation, then we will come down with Him in Jerusalem? To reign with Him after armageddon? Pls reply, i need it. Tq.Hello,It is difficult to determine how the rapture and the events following it will play out. We have a general overview, but it is difficult to nail down specifics. We believe the Bible tells us that the rapture will happen at the end of the tribulation. Then, those who are resurrected will participate in the battle of Armageddon (Joel 2; Revelation 16).Again John as you are saying, the bowls occur between the rapture and Armageddon therefore there is time between the two events. How much time is debatable but there is a gap.There is a gap between the two, yes.john, finally u agree there is gap between the rapture n the coming down to earth.only how long, we dont know.let me try to refer in Daniel 12:11-12 (11)FROM THE TIME THAT DAILY SACRIFICE IS TAKEN AWAY, ANDTHE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION IS SET UP, THRE SHALL BE 1290 DAYS.(12)BLESSED IS HE WHO WAITS, AND COMES TO THE 1335 DAYS. so john, if we read the whole scripture, its about the end time.let me say, 7yrs agreement is set up, break up at the midlle, 1290days later will be rapture, the people who left behind still hv time untill 1335days.(45)days to enter the 1000yrs kingdom,of course facing the wrath of God but repent. so can we say the gap is about 45days,enough for God pouring His wrath. but i pray, only holly spirit let me write this, not my own mind.l dont want to be deceive, correct me if i am wrong, in Jesus name. tq.Bening,I said that there is a short gap of time between the rapture and the battle of Armageddon.Bening, Rev. seems to suggest that after the resurrection/rapture, the saved will be with Jesus at the marriage supper while the bowls of God’s wrath are poured out on the wicked. Then the armies of the wicked are “gathered” to Armageddon where Jesus returns with His armies and destroys the wicked armies. He then sets up His millennial kingdom where we live and reign with Him for a 1,000 years. After that we see the New Heaven and new earth and New Jerusalem. Hope this helps.thanks John+Curt. thats mean there is a gap of time between the rapture and the coming down to earth, and Lord Jesus will “appear” 2 time? am l right?Check out Matthew 24:29-31:Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: 30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.According to scripture, Jesus appears and sends out His angels to gather the elect (rapture).thanks, understood. only wonder since rapture will occurs when H e returns, when the wrath of God should take place…anyway l will wait on Jesus to lift me up..shallom.God’s wrath is contained in the vials (Revelation 16:1-2). It is interesting to note that under the 6th seal, Jesus says, “Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame” (Revelation 16:15). Those are the same words He speaks in Matthew 24:43 after describing the rapture.If I may point out a couple things it may bring understanding to some of your theories. With all do respect. The 6 Seals spoken about have in fact been opened. The seventh seal is rather peculiar, however. I believe when the 7th is opened; the 7 trumpets start.Hi people, I was thinking about the blood moons, or the last of 8 blood moons that were not at all as the one blood moon that took place in A D 1780.
 Some have said, The Four Horsemen of The Apostolic Time; otherwise called the 7 Seals in the book of Revelation started in our generation. Take a look and read what the 4 horses really mean.
 The first 6 seals that are mentioned in the book of Revelation, particularly, the first 4 seals that speak of the four horses of the apocalypse, as some refer to them as; have been, in fact, opened in 1st century A. D. Yes, over two thousand years ago. Some think, and teach, it’s in our day, that these riders will unleash great upheavals, giving warnings as to the second coming of Christ, truly these will also come.
 The horses and their riders, have items of significance to be defined only in symbolic, religious language. Sadly, it is taught, all around the world that this first seal, the rider on the white horse, is the Antichrist. Absolutely not, it’s the opposite. This first rider is, in fact, Jesus Christ, with a crown, and a bow. “A crown” referring to His kingship and the other, “A bow” as the true message He wanted us to have untainted with error. But the enemy would see to it that the Gospel would be covered in obscurity.
 This is the period of time, in which it took for the first four horses or Seals, to be opened. Bible truth that came from Jesus was undefiled and not mixed or tainted with error. 1st century A. D…. Depicted as, white, in its purity, the Rider on the white horse has the original message, Jesus and, the disciples. Again, as the early Gospel teachings reflect the truth; the true church is pure and white completely Sound in correct doctrine.
 So in this sense; stay with me and you will see what I’m saying. Riding from century, to century, the horses gal-up along “symbolically”, the purity of the Gospel, Once-a-pone-a time; rides into history only to the 4th horse 4th Seal.
Now the 2nd Seal opens, the time is A D 100, this rider and horse is red and he had a great sword. This could only depict the Roman Empire occupancy of that era. The sword is understood as to eliminate 2nd century Christians. Red denoting the colours of the Roman Empire politically. This horse and rider galloped up until A D 313.
Then the 3rd Seal was opened, this rider and horse is black and it had a pair of balancing scales in his hand. There is so much to explain here. But I will try and simplify it as best I can. A D 313 the original Gospel message white is now shrouded in darkness black, it is the opposite. The balancing scales depicts the true Gospel message will not completely be gone; nevertheless, the truth is being tainted with paganism, heathenism, and myths, and demon worship. The truth can be seen again, but covered in darkness. This horse and rider galloped up until A D 538.
Then the 4th Seal was opened, this rider and horse is pale and his name that sat on him was “Death, and Hell” Note here, when we refer to someone who may be ill; we may use the term, you are pale. What I’m trying to say is, the true Church started by Jesus A D 31 has galloped into, what are the 1st 4 seals to A D 1517. Depicting a very sick time; the once true light of God’s word riding into a period in history referred to as the Dark Ages, beginning in the year 538 A.D. and ended in the year A D 1798. Thus, the true word is in complete obscurity, false information and true light is in complete darkness, overshadowed in sickness. Beginning in A D 538, the Roman Empire fell politically. Moreover, a long story short, the Roman Empire derived through the ruins of political Rome. Justinian exiled the good bishop and set up his own puppet. For over 1000 years the Roman Catholic Church otherwise known as the Papal States, Papal Supremacy, ruled with tyranny and oppression. These days were called the Dark Ages because the Catholic Church took all Bibles and books to do with the truth Jesus gave us; and now it is completely told to the people all those years; that they were too stupid to understand the Holy writ, and that the church will provide divine counsel, and interpretation. What I want you to see Is. From Jesus time to the end of the Roman Catholic Church; I never once mentioned the influence that created this mess.
 In the book of Revelation 12: 3, God refers to the devil as the great red dragon. Why red? Red is depicting the colours of the Roman Empire. The devil is called a snake in Genesis; as this suits the way he moved in and out of political Empires. When finally he found a way to keep his political Roman Empire, just when it fell apart; he seized the opportunity. With a word change here and there; and the Roman Empire went from political to religious. Thus the Roman Catholic (universal) Church, ruled up until the year A D 1798. Another prophecy to explore called the 1260 years. As God saw It, It was written in Scripture. Yes the enemy has done many years hiding the pure truth from all of us. We need to be awake in these last days, and study prophecy.
 A French general by the name Napoleon wanted to rule the world under his administration. However, he realized that unless he can break the back of the Papal power, he would not achieve this goal; total authority to himself is what he wanted; in the year A D 1798 Napoleon achieved this. Between A D 538 and A D 1798 the Catholic Church was responsible for over 250 million deaths. Any and all who wanted to stand against the Church were hunted down and murdered. In the time of European history the Vatican Church received a deadly wound A D 1798, as said in the book of Revelation. However, it goes on to say the deadly wound would be healed. Healed would mean brought back to life. In 1929 came a man by the name Mussolini. He gave the wrights back to the Papal power to become a sovereign political government of its own. From that time until now the Vatican slowly made its way back and today it is a religious power claiming the Church infallible and thought to be higher than God himself; Boasting blasphemies without regard to the faithful followers that really don’t know the origins of the Roman Catholic Church. Don’t get me wrong there are many beautiful Catholic Church believers, as I to was a catholic first 20 years of my life. It is the religious system I’m am talking about.
 Today some of the pagan beliefs having deriving from political Rome; unfortunately crept in unaware and silently, into modern day Protestantism and accepted and adopted, blending in with, otherwise sound doctrine; that should of not been tampered with. Thus, Roman theology sadly has mixed all its pagan gods, atheistic ways, and teachings; and a whole category of multiple choices In most Christian churches all around the world….The Roman Empire, has gone from political to religious; in the sense that, Christians have adopted and blended truth with so many errors. Plainly, in some of our worshiping circles. God is saying, no, do not believe, nor compromise.
 Bible prophecy warns us that in the last days it will be a generation of anything goes, not to worry God won’t mind or make a big deal about it. Well do you think he made a big deal when Eve bit into the apple? Yes it was, it cost Jesus to be killed on the cross. Again today, while pastors, evangelists say don’t worry and compromise on Biblical teachings some not sure themselves as to an important doctrine, mixed in heathenism rituals and Roman pagan teachings. That is why the Roman Catholic Church, is in fact called the Roman Catholic Church.
Now to finish with the 5th & 6th Seals, they too were opened; the 5th is referring to all those who were murdered during the 1260 years a lot of them died as martyrs’ burned at the stake, thrown in dungeons, fed to animals; and the list goes on. One only needs to study the time the Church ruled. As you can imagine these souls that were killed are screaming out to God for vengeance as their blood cries for their Savior however, this 5th seal represents the tribulation that those souls went through.
Now remember God is a God of order and truth. What I’m saying is if I’m correct, then I need to prove to you the 6th seal has been opened to. I want you to see the dates and order of events. First read Revelation 6: 12, there was a great earthquake; to this day the biggest earthquake in recorded history took place In A D 1755 in Lisbon “shook Europe, Africa, and north America and covered four million square miles” Nothing has topped this quake yet.
Now the next part notice the date. “May 19th 1780, brought a remarkable darkening of the sun and moon” “For hours an intense darkness covered all of New England” “When night time came the darkness became more terrifying” “Finally, after midnight the darkness went away, and a blood red moon appeared” “Then in November, 1833, an astounding meteoric shower, the most intense ever recorded, covered nearly the whole North American continent” 1) Earth quake 2) Darkening of the sun 3) Followed by a blood red moon 4) The stars fall from Heaven not like an ordinary shower event; but like the prophecy said the stars will fall from one point in the sky “like a fig tree casteth her untimely figs”
Now the 7th Seal in Revelation 8 still needs to be opened. These events will take place again in our time. May God Help you to understand this I have wrote for you.Yes but that does not mean 2 “2nd comings”. At the rapture, Jesus is seen “in the clouds”, but at the 2nd coming Jesus actually returns to earth, hence the 2nd coming.Jesus Christ only returns once, and the rapture occurs when He returns. Compare Matthew 24:29-31 and Revelation 6:12-17. Both of those passages refer to the same event. Notice, the events in Matthew 24 fall under the opening of the 6th seal.John and I clearly disagree here. Jesus comes in the clouds at the 7th trumpet and He comes to earth at the battle of Armageddon after the bowls of wrath are pour out. That is scripture. Unless John can show you how those 2 events happen at the same time then it remains that there are two events. The rapture is not the 2nd coming because Jesus does not come to earth which is why scripture is so meticulous to show that the rapture is “in the clouds”.The 7th trumpet and the 7th vial describe the same event. There is no problem for me.I’m a pre trib believer. The sooner our Lord comes for us, the better. Our job is to keep on trying to get people saved.I am a believer in the post-tribulation rapture and I agree; We need to keep on preaching the Gospel!The preaching of the gospel and getting out the word of God is spot on. Witnessing and testifying is good also, however you pre-tribulation believe is not good.
JESUS doesn’t come until the 7th trumpet. He DOESN”T come during the seal judgments. The seals come before the trumpets and they come before the last final bowl/vial judgments. It says in the twinkling of an eye at the “last” trumpet.
Please read a few time Revelation 11: 15-1. That is the scripture that tells us JESUS is going to appear and He is then going to take possession of this world from Satan, right then. It can’t be before that time dear, sorry. You have been taught wrong…or deceived. Learn the “truth” that will set you free.To Judy Scott. To answer your question about which theory I believe it would best be described as Post-trib/pre-wrath, since the rapture is at the 7th trumpet which is at the end of the tribulation and just before the outpouring of the wrath of God in the bowls as I outlined in my previous post. Since every reference to the rapture involves trumpets, how did you conclude the rapture would be at the 7th seal?You are correct and it is also my belief that the rapture will occur at the 7th Trumpet. he seals and trumpets are the wrath of satan, why? (b/c he is still the god of this evil world). He will persecute the saints of the Most High GOD. JESUS said that the antichrist (indwelled by satan) will make “war” with the saints (that’s us).
The church will be removed (taken out-raptured) at the 7th trumpet. Once we are out of here then the Bowl Judgments will be poured out on all of the unrepentant sinners. They are the “wrath of GOD” on a world full of sinners and evil doers.
Rev. 11:15-19 explains what will happen. JESUS will appear and remove the church. He will take possession of the world at that point and the ark of the covenant (testament) will even be seen at that point in time.
We are in the birthpains that Revelation tells us about. It only gets worse from here on out. Salvation and preparation is the key.Bening; your review of Daniel’s time lines is technically accurate but maybe not theologically. You got John to admit there is time between the rapture and 2nd coming was profound. However scripture says there are 2 and only 2 resurrections. 1 for the righteous and 1 for the unrighteous. Therefore there is no one “left behind” that can repent. When the righteous are raptured/resurrected, all the righteous are gone and only unbelievers/unrighteous remain. Now to the time line. Since I believe the rapture and thus the first resurrection occurs at the 7th trumpet and that occurs at the end of tribulation, that is 1260 day after the breaking of the treaty. Armageddon occurs at day 1290 and between day 1290 and 1335, the angels go throughout the earth and root out and kill all who have taken the mark of the beast. At this point all the unrighteous are dead and only unbelievers remain. These unbelievers become the people over whom we will rule during the millennium. They will repopulate the earth during that time and are the ones Satan will deceive and who will rebel after the 1,000 years. This is what I believe. Hope it helps.joining conversation …Welcome! It’s good to have you here.It seems obvious to me that the five wise virgins who brought extra oil in jars were fully prepared to wait a LONG time. The foolish virgins’ lights were GOING OUT because they were expecting an EARLY ARRIVAL. The five foolish virgins ask the wise to share their oil but they would not. The wise virgins prepared by DOING the sayings of Jesus. It cost them to give to the poor. It cost them be kind to rude and angry people. It cost a lot to become prepared to endure tribulation! The foolish virgins had done none of these things because they thought they would never need to go through ANY SUFFERING so they never bothered to identify with those who are suffering RIGHT NOW and SHARE IN THE SUFFERING of the needy.  That is why the wise told told the foolish to ” Go and buy oil for yourselves”  The foolish virgins leave but the wise ARE prepared To wait LONG into the NIGHT !  to suffer and die (if needed).
Martyrdom is a closed door. The death of the foolish is also a closed door but they are on the outside of the door while the wise are on the inside with the Lord.The foolish virgins would have dragged the wise virgins away with them into apostasy from Jesus if the wise continued to try to fellowship with the foolish during the tribulation! The house of the foolish will fall when the storm comes. Doesn’t the Lord  Jesus end the whole discourse about the end time events(Matthew chapters 24 and 25 are all about the tribulation). by saying ‘In as much as you have done unto the least of these my brethren , you have done it unto me ‘ The parable about the the Evil Servant, the Stewards and the others in Matt. 24 and 25 have similar meanings and should be read as specific references to the end times and how we should prepare ourselves to endure whatever we may face.Excellent pointVery true Marcus, whatever it is our Lord’s time frame, we must be consistent and be in strict obedience to His word, “watch and pray” to be accounted worthy to escape His wrath. “…. and they did not love their lives to the death”, and very well, we will overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony.With reference to the post initiated by Linda Bauer on
August 17, 2015 at 6:58 pm:-I noticed there are some timing errors flying around (eg that we are currently in the 6th trumpet era). I feel compelled to clear this error up.Firstly to say that the book of Revelation is a REVEALING not a CONCEALING.
The book is VERY chronological but at odd places it appears not because e.g. it backtracks to introduce the two witnesses who appear at the midpoint of the ‘7’ who later deliver all the trumpet judgments. In addition there is backtracking in Rev 12-13 to the distant past as well as future are covered as it hurriedly covers satan and Israels origin and the formers repeated attempts to extinguish the latter and all its seed , Jesus’ birth , death and ascension, satans future casting out of heaven by Michael followed soon after by antichrists (satans vessel) rage against all Gods people. Pretty much everything else in the book is wonderfully broadly chronological. One of the upshots of this is that just as Rev clearly depicts the trumpets do not begin UNTIL the 7th seal and the 7 bowls do not begin UNTIL the 7th trumpet. The 4th – 5th seal is the time window when satan goes hard after all Gods people and so the 4th seal is on or around the midpoint. This being said the 6th trumpet therefore cannot begin until well after the midpoint of the ‘7’ and specifically we are NOT currently  in the 6th trumpet era. In fact I believe we are concurrently living in the era of the 1st , 2nd and 3rd seal (first 3 horsemen) – ie these 3 already started riding out consecutively some time ago and are continuing to do so.
The 4th seal is not world war it is simply antichrists rage against all who will not follow him and their wholesale destruction by him (even the ‘wild beasts of the earth’ – in the 3rd world in particular – become demonised and go around killing Gods people at his behest).
Anyway since the bowls don’t begin until the 7th trumpet and the 7th trumpet is way after the midpoint and in fact near the end of the ‘7’ please take a close look at Rev 16.Bowls 4 & 5 include the phrase ‘…and they repented not….’. Now I ask you Is God unjust ?’ Would there ‘appear’ to be repentance opportunities when there actually weren’t any ?
Next in Rev 16:15 (and at the 6th BOWL) Jesus is telling His  faithful remnant to stay alert and ready for rapture (after which repentance is no longer possible – Noahs ark/the ten virgins) . The 6th bowl is the gathering of the chaff (The beast gathers the worlds armies to fight Jesus because of all the pain inflicted by the preceding judgments) and according to the parable of the tares the gathering of the wheat (the rapture) is to follow hot on its heels and both according to the parable, occur AT THE END OF THE AGE. Bowls 1-5 are directed at the beast and his kingdom and don’t touch Gods people (isn’t God able to make a distinction between his own and the people of his enemy as in the days of Pharoah ??).
This just leaves the 7th bowl (from which Gods faithful are rescued having met Jesus in the clouds and now waiting there with Him to observe all that’s about to come on the world) to be delivered.
An almighty cataclysm comes upon the world bringing whole cities crumbling down and Jesus resumes His descent with all His saints and deals with beast and his army with only the word of His mouth.
This is the only account of things that makes complete sense to me.Additional thoughts on this: The trumpet judgments are not the same thing as the bowl judgments as for one thing their extent is different. The trumpet judgments extend only as much as 1/3 (this is the same proportion of stars (angels) that lucifer swept away (convinced to follow him in ages past)) – so in fact the trumpet judgments are the kingdom of darkness being turned on itself. The bowls however are complete in coverage (in terms of the wicked that is) and are the DIRECT hand of God against the wicked.Regarding the scripture “….but for the sake of the elect shall those days be shortened…” is referring to  the period between the 4th and 6th seal when antichrist tries to abort Gods plan (which he believes will culminate 42 months after his installation) and promise by leaving none of His people alive on earth to rapture. There have to be some left to rapture so God’s cuts the slaughter short at the 6th seal which due to a/c’s efficiency at slaughtering ends up being well in advance of the 42 months.….also the 6th seal is therefore at an unknown day or hour however the trumpet and bowl judgments are then ‘stretched in time’ (aside from the 5 months fixed period judgment) so that the resurrection-rapture occurs as scheduled at the 42 month point (‘last day’ / end of the ‘7’)Catching away-rapture-calling up will be at the 7th trumpet. The Trumpet will sound and the dead in CHRIST will then rise. The rapture happens Pre-Wrath, meaning just prior to the wrath of GOD.
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye at the “last trumpet.”
That is when the dead will meet the LORD in the air. JESUS will be waiting on them in the clouds of heaven and they shall “rise up”. They were dead in their graves. Bible says they are rising up, they are not coming down (from Heaven). They were asleep in their graves and are going to hear the trumpet (the shofar) and they will “rise up” at that time.
The people who are saved who are still alive will rise up also. They will all receive their new glorified bodies fit for the kingdom of GOD on earth.
All of them (the saved) will then go to be with JESUS and His host of angels. It’s described as a multitude of them who will accompany Him to earth from Heaven. He will leave FATHER GOD and ascend to earth to gather up His church, the bride of CHRIST.Wandakate: Has the following ever occurred to you ? Namely that the 7th trumpet CONTINUES to sound thoughout the 7 bowls ? ie that even if The rapture occurs just before the 7th bowl then it’s still AT the sounding of the 7th trumpet just NOT AT VERY FIRST SOUNDING !This is supported by Rev 10:7
But in the DAYS OF THE VOICE OF the seventh angel, when he
shall BEGIN TO sound, the
mystery of God should be
finished, as he hath declared to
his servants the prophets.Regarding the scripture “Peace, peace and then comes sudden destruction…..” – this is explained by the fact that Gods people will be the common enemy and there will be one ruler (from the 4th seal onwards). Gods people will be ruthlessly, comprehensively ‘ethnically cleansed’ largely behind the scenes. This will be a time of unprecedented (albeit false) peace because there will be no dissenting voices…..the destruction comes later (in the form of the trumpet and later bowl judgments) at the 6th seal…at this point satan won’t mind desisting from inspiring wars and battles throughout the world as ‘world peace’ by his method will suit his ends perfectly……his man will be on the throne of the world….For any still questioning whether the Trumpets are part of the wrath of God:-12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the WRATH OF THE LAMB:17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?so clearly what follows (7th seal +) is ALL the wrath of God.Next…15 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is FILLED  UP the wrath of God.This is a reference to the 7 BOWLS. Thayers take on the Greek word  (strongs G5055) is:“with reference also to the form, to do just as commanded, and generally involving the notion of time, to perform the LAST ACT WHICH COMPLETES A PROCESS, to accomplish, fulfil” The FILLED UP is exactly what it says….the TRUMPETS partially fill up Gods Wrath but the BOWLS fill His Wrath it UP TO THE TOP. There are plenty of precedents in the Old Testament for God bringing judgment via His enemies.apologies…in place of “formers repeated attempts to extinguish the latter and all its seed” instead read “formers repeated attempts to extinguish/abort Israels Messiah”Regarding the 1st seal …..the mistake often made is that the rider is the antichrist in waiting who signs a treaty 42 months before the midpoint of the 7. The fact is that the ‘spirit’ of antichrist has been riding out since te birth of the Church !aah but doesn’t Jesus come at the 7th trumpet….how can you say he comes just before the 7th bowl ? Ans: simple. The 7th trumpet IS the 7 bowls so to come at any point within the bowls is to come at the 7th trumpet (easy , no ?)No, not easy. There are 3 sets of separate judgments, the Seals, then the Trumpets, and finally the Bowl or Vial judgments.
The first two sets of 7 are for everybody as they are the tribulation and thus the wrath of satan…then the great tribulation is the last 7 and they are going to be poured out onto the earth where all of the unrepentant sinners remain, they are the Wrath of GOD…
The church is not appointed to the wrath of GOD, therefore they will be taken out before the last 7 judgments.
Read Rev. 11:15-19 and that is when JESUS appears. It plainly tells us that He appears at that time taking possession of this world away from satan. Satan is the god of this world until that time when JESUS comes and takes it from him…wandakate:  you’ve been banging the same pre-wrath (specifically pre 7 bowls) drum for a long time. Could you please tell me who Jesus is addressing at the 6th bowl in Rev 16:15 ? 12 The SIXTH angel poured out his BOWL on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. 13 Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.15 “LOOK, I COME LIKE A THIEF! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.”16 Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.17 The SEVENTH angel poured out his BOWL into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!  Now you and I know that Rev is very chronological once you understand how it’s been structured so how can this not be a call by Jesus to stay ready for rapture between bowls 6 and 7 ?It is very clear from the below that the wrath of God only starts after the 6th seal and because the 7th seal marks the start of the 7 trumpets and the 7 trumpets mark the start of the 7 bowls this clearly makes the trumpet and bowls  the wrath of God (judgment on the wicked for their treatment/massacre of God’s people): 12 And I beheld when he had opened the SIXTH SEAL, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.
14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the WRATH OF THE LAMB:
17 For the GREAT DAY OF HIS WRATH IS COME; and who shall be able to stand?..sorry meant to say….and the 7TH trumpet markS the start of the 7 bowlsMaking the 4th (midpoint of the ‘7’) – 6th seal (part way through the last half of the ‘7’)  = the tribulation/great tribulation/persecution/wrath of satan etc… and seal 7 onwards (incorporating the 7 trumpets and bowls) the wrath of GOD. The reason you see satanic agents in operation during the the first 5 trumpets (confirmed by the extent of the judgments being limited to1/3 – representing the number of fallen angels compared to the total number of angels – see Rev 12 – for ‘stars’ (regarding the dragon sweeping away) read ‘angels’) – this is reference to ages past where lucifer convinced 1/3 of the angels to rebel. Anyway the trumpet judgments simply show that God is in overall charge – even of the forces of darkness – they cannot overstep the mark he sets.apologies also the 6th TRUMPET  involves satanic agentsThe start point of God’s wrath being the 7th seal is also clear from below Rev 8
The SEVENTH SEAL and the Golden Censer
8 When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.3 Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the PRAYERS OF ALL GOD’S PEOPLE, on the golden altar in front of the throne. 4 The SMOKE of the incense, together with the PRAYERS of God’s people, went up before God from the angel’s hand. 5 Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.[The ‘prayers’ referred to are the prayers for justice prayed at the 5th seal in Rev 6:
9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 10 They CALLED OUT in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, UNTIL YOU JUDGE the inhabitants of the earth and AVENGE OUT BLOOD?” 11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters,[e] were killed just as they had been.]AND THEN FOLLOWING THIS…..The Trumpets
6 Then the seven angels who had the SEVEN TRUMPETS prepared to sound them.i.e. the TRUMPET JUDGMENTS are in response to the saints prayers for justice at seal 5 (even though satanic agents deliver them !)  therefore they are part and parcel (i.e. along with the bowls) of the wrath of God !I would advise anybody expecting something significant on Sep 15th and radically adjusting their lives accordingly………Don’t !The so called ‘proof’ of this idea twists Daniel’s separate ‘seven’ sevens to apply to modern times instead of the pre-Christ past as they’re intended.Hi!…you are one of the first comments I could relate too; however I do believe that we will go through the first 3/1/2 years of tribulation but I also like the comments about the seventy weeks of Daniel I have never studied Daniel but I am very much looking forward to it;this whole debate I am pretty I’m impressed with no one is being unkind or rude to one another…this helps me take into consideration the differences of each person involved..makes me want to study the scripture more and ask his spirit to help me understand (a quick note ) I cannot see the church going throught the whole 7 years of the Tribulation however since this word is a speculated idea from Daniel then I will be inclined to do a further assessment of the the word and meaning Tribulation. My view is simply this :No one knows: I don’t claim too and never will; however I am very intrigued with the different views I have heard so far.. This is where I stand today I do not have to fight  and I am secure in the finished work of the cross and the incredible Grace of god..even so come lord Jesus come,and if he  wants me to suffer for him than so be it,and whether it is today or until the 7th trumpet, seal, bowl, vial or death May God by his Grace And by his spirit help me to choose to accept whatever, whenever, and however he chooses for me to share in his sufferings. Be it next week or in the next twenty years I will not be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ for it is by his power We Stand. because of this debate it has encouraged me to long for his coming for this day forward until the actual event or events take place..it will be me seeing my life from a different angle.. I am eternal and you come be eternal with me.. I am just not home yet.If you read my most recent long post it’ll be evident that the tribulation/great tribulation is < 3.5 years (and most likely < 3 years) and begins at the midpoint of the '7'. There is a designated 1,260 days of persecution but God has to cut it short due to antichrists efficiency at purging God's people. You need to clean the slate and bin the preconception of a full 7 year tribulation and then move forward from that point.1,260 days = 3.5 * 360 days (360 days = 1 prophetic year)…Yes a Jewish year in fact is 360 years called A TIME, and is a perfect circle. In this case the earth around the Sun,…A 360….Time Times and half a Time = 1260 literal years. Or you might know it as 42 months, or One thousand two Hundred and threescore days. Or three days and an half…All = 3.5 years. And a quick note the 70 years ended in 34AD.                                                                                        How do you who say the one week refers to the Antichrist? not so. Leave that week alone in it’s proper setting; as it glorifies the Messiah and all the work He did before the crucifixion setting up the true church. Nevertheless their still is a 7 year period mistakenly called the 7 year tribe. no one is going anywhere until the 2nd coming of Christ. We will all go through the time called the abomination of desolation. Or called the Mark of the beast. Do you know how to get victory over the mark of lets just say the Mark of the devil. For those who really believe they will be gone before this time need recalculating as much as I hoped it was true. I repeat again we will all go through it. But do not worry those who worship God will be sealed and therefore are protected through the time of the plagues. After the 7 plagues everything is decided; Jesus returns as King of King’s and Lord of Lord’s.Acc to Daniel the there will be 69 ‘weeks’ (week= 7 prophetic years) from the issuing of Artaxerexes decree to rebuild and restore Jerusalem (445 BC) to Messiah’s ‘presentation’. Note that 69 * 7 = 483 prophetic years which when you correct by multiplying the fraction 360/365.25 gives you approx 476 Julian years and moving forward 476 JULIAN years from 445BC leads you to 32AD. In fact the 173,880 days (69 * 7 * 360) from the decree takes you EXACTLY to Jesus arrival on a donkey in Jerusalem.That leaves the outstanding 70th week which looking at the events around Jesus time (in particular Matt 24) clearly does not fulfil all of that eg abomination of desolation, signs in the heavens so it must be yet future. The sacking of Jerusalem in 70AD was a ‘foreshadow’. The complete fulfilment is yet to come.Kev: Forgive me my original post I  wrote was a mistake explaining the 1260 year prophecy with the 2300 year prophecy. They are two separate entities. Nevertheless, In all due respect, trying to fit a square into a circle is the best way for me to say what your telling me when looking at the 2300 day/year prophecy. First, the Old Testament was all Hebrew and therefore needs to be understood by the standards of the house of Jacob.                                             The Jewish calendar has the right way to keep time. If the earth goes around the Sun regardless how big the diameter is, it’s still a 360 or one revolution. That’s what a 360 in fact is. With this understanding the Jewish calendar is in line with prophecy. Daniel 7: 25 say’s “Time and Times and the dividing of time”                                           So a Jewish Time was what they called 1 year = 360 days, and Times, plural would be double and is 720, and a dividing of Time is half, so would be 180. Now if you add them all together it comes to 1260 days. And in Prophecy a day is a year. “I have  appointed thee each day for a year” Ezekiel 4: 6 & “each day for a year” Numbers 14: 34. Now lets look at the 2300 years. Daniel 8: 14 The decree to rebuild Jerusalem by Artaxerxes was actually 457 BC not 445 BC, your numbers are wrong. From that date 70 weeks are determined upon thy people. So 457 BC + 70 weeks = 34 AD This is including the 1 week most take out of context in the 70 years. This last week after 69 years is referring to Jesus who would confirm the covenant for 3.5 years then be cut off. Daniel 9: 27 and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease” Jesus for filled this when He died on the cross. These last 7 years glorifies our Messiah by His death. Ceasing the sacrifice and oblation; meant the Sanctuary service was over as Jesus paid it all. This further is well explained in the book of Matthew 27: 51 a unseen hand ripped the thick vail that divided the Most Holy from the Holy place. Depicting the sacrifice ( Jesus ) and oblation to cease and have been completed in Christ as that was the whole purpose of the Sanctuary, it foreshadowed what Jesus would do on the cross. Now “70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city. Daniel 9: 24. What this means is after the middle of the week or 3.5 years; another 3.5 years thereafter are to still go to the house of Israel. So what Jesus taught in the first half of the week; was still to go to the house of Israel, or the new covenant. But the house of Israel rejected Jesus message and as all know this message went to the Gentiles. The year was 34 AD the same year Steven was stoned to death, because he tried to tell them that Jesus was the Messiah in their rejection they killed Steven. Exactly 70 years from the decree were determined upon thy people; or in other words the last week was for the house of Israel.The start point is 445 BC not 457 BC see below:-Artaxerxes I /ˌɑːrtəˈzɜːrksiːz/ (Persian: اردشیر یکم‎‎, Old Persian: ARATAXASHASSA Artaxšaça,[2] “whose rule (xšaça < *xšaϑram) is through arta (truth)";[3] Hebrew: אַרְתַּחְשַׁשְׂתָּא‎‎ ; Greek: Ἀρταξέρξης[4]) was the fifth King of Persia from 465 BC to 424 BC. He was the third son of Xerxes I.So his reign started in 465 BCNehemiah 1 tells us that it is set in the 20th year of his reign:-1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah:In the month of Kislev in the TWENTIETH year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, 2 Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.The 20th year of his reign is clearly in 465 – 20 = 445 BC.Next we know that Nehemiah was commissioned to rebuild JERUSALEM (not the TEMPLE – that decree went out earlier – I believe that was the 457 BC decree).Finally…Daniel 9
25 ‘Know and understand this: from the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild JERUSALEM until the Anointed One,[f] the ruler, comes, there will be seven “sevens”, and sixty-two “sevens”.ie 69 prophetic weeks are to be counted from the 445 BC date to the arrival of Messiah (his announcement in Jerusalem on a colt). These two dates are precisely 69 * 7 * 360 = 173,880 days apart.It is also blindingly clear that many of the the events of Revelation have  not yet come to pass e.g. where is all the destruction associated with the trumpets and the bowls ? Is Jesus here yet ruling and reigning ? Has the Kingdom of God been established on earth and is Jerusalem at peace and ruling over the nations ? Is Jesus here yet in bodily form ? Where is the mark of the beast ? etc….etc…  the 70th week is clearly yet futureAlso what exactly was the abomination of desolation at that time (prophesied to occur at the midpoint of the ‘7’) ?To reiterate a post I just responded to:
Acc to Daniel the there will be 69 ‘weeks’ (week= 7 prophetic years) from the issuing of Artaxerexes decree to rebuild and restore Jerusalem (445 BC) to Messiah’s ‘presentation’. Note that 69 * 7 = 483 prophetic years which when you correct by multiplying the fraction 360/365.25 gives you approx 476 Julian years and moving forward 476 JULIAN years from 445BC leads you to 32AD. In fact the 173,880 days (69 * 7 * 360) from the decree takes you EXACTLY to Jesus arrival on a donkey in Jerusalem.
That leaves the outstanding 70th week which looking at the events around Jesus time (in particular Matt 24) clearly does not fulfil all of that eg abomination of desolation, signs in the heavens so it must be yet future. The sacking of Jerusalem in 70AD was a ‘foreshadow’. The complete fulfilment is yet to come.Kev: I appreciate your persistence in answering peoples questions with your knowledge. However, please correct me if I’m wrong.                           People confuse the 7 year tribulation with the 7th week of the 70 years that were determined for the house of Israel; but the Israelite’s rejected the message after 3.5 years, finishing the last week of the 70 years on the date 34 AD, the year Steven was stoned by the Pharisees; at which point the message the house of Israel rejected went to the Gentiles. The Gospel.                                            In other posts I explained how that the first 6 seals were in fact opened. But the 7th seal is not in Chapter 6 of Revelation as the first 6 seals are; but is apart for a reason. Revelation 8: 1 or the 7th seal says “and there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour” Given the proper interpretation mathematically, this half an hour = one week or 7 days which is 7 years. Not the 7 year tribulation, because the 7th seal say’s there was silence in heaven. And its not of the 70 weeks of Daniel’s prophecy, as Jesus for filled this already.                                                           So were is this one week everyone is talking about in the book of Revelation? The week or 7 years everyone has been talking about; many are confusing Scripture verses to fit what is apparently a 7 year time frame that many believe is the time that takes place calling it the tribulation; and in the middle of the week 3.5 years in, the Antichrist turns on everybody. (K one quick note, if the Antichrist makes his appearance 3.5 years in, then what has the devil been doing? sitting around doing nothing? and even right now? People, lets not forget what the Apostle Paul said in his day. He said that the spirit of Antichrist has already begun, that was 2000 years ago) Now, the big problem with this tribulation,that started when God made man; as far as I’m concerned; what I mean is, if we are waiting for a time that the world will be worse, what do we call present day 2017 AD? Caring on thereafter, before this tribulation, is preceded yet by another mysterious teaching that is completely not in harmony with sound doctrine, called the “secret rapture” like,.. where is common sense here? seriously,.. Jesus will snatch people away? really? It would be far easier to explain Santa claws then this secret, whatever they call it.                                   So Before you get upset with me, yes, there is 7 years to come. But these are the years God sends the two prophets or witnesses to preach the true undefiled Gospel Jesus taught to His apostles; depicted by the rider on the white horse 2000 years ago. Yes Jesus did go forth conquering and to conquer; He defeated the enemy by dying on the cross. From that point on the enemy set his sights on the true church, respectfully those depicted in Revelation chapter 12, and in verse 17, says “And the devil was worth with the women and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the Commandment of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Revelation 12: 1 says, “and I saw a women clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet” The church Jesus said to peter “and on this Rock will I build my church” The Gospel is represented by the sun, as the sun is the dominating light that scientifically is the greatest star in our solar system; taking care of our earth. 2000 years later the true Gospel has lost much truth. The woman or the church from head to her feet; can be compared to the image of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of the matalic image depicting the four world empires down into our time finally the second coming of Christ. Back to the church this woman is standing on, as the moon down to her feet. Not only is the moon a good reference as to a solid foundation; but, is more and more. Back to science the moon gets its light from the sun. But even on a full moon in the night sky its not enough to illuminate the darkness. So from the sun 2000 years to our time can be understood as the darkness the Gospel that Jesus started bright to a generation living in darkness. Is the truth fully consumed no; but has depreciated over 2000 years.Hi all Kev: again blessings to you. I will carry on, and reiterate the teachings on subjects not Biblical and the deadly repercussions if not in harmony to sound doctrine to a certain extent. But first, I don’t want anyone to get this idea that I write a lot and judge others, not so. I am someone who loves the Lord as you do. If you’re reading this please let me know your thoughts below.
       So back to seeing things from another angle as opposed to the most accepted modern day popular theories. What I’m saying is look at it this way, including myself, if we believe truth is what our church, our friends, our heritage, our spouse, believes is not how we should approach God and His word. And is quite normal to do so, as most of us came from this mind set, I believed what I was told for the longest time. Regardless, God does not judge as most think. He knows us better than we may know ourselves. However, how far we want to go down the rabbit hole of knowledge with the Lord, He leaves up to us as He gives us the free will. Essentially, some want the full meal deal and discover that if we all had gone further down, the surface gold we once were satisfied with, was just not enough; but going deeper we realize how come we never did this sooner, especially when new truth floods into you as a well of living waters spring up inside you as a fountain of eternal waters. What a beautiful God we have just knowing that Jesus came down, yes God himself, to die in our place. Yes Jesus took the responsibility because God made us after His own image, after His likeness, and could not fathom the thought He would lose us if He had never came down. What greater love is there that One would give His life that you and I may live? We can’t begin to measure the height, width, and length this kind of love truly is. My Jesus thank you Lord.
        Carrying on, others satisfy themselves when we give our life to God and start reading His Manuel, but without our heart, we overlook otherwise important verses the Holy Spirit really wants to show us. The Holy Bible; nevertheless, becomes our journey to great enlightenment. And to some who are new Christians on this page, I couldn’t imagine how overwhelmed you might be with all these posts. (YouTube) One is saying this, the other is saying that, and before you know it there are 20 different ways to look at an interpretation on subjects we take for granted. These subjects needing more Scripture references namely, prophetic prophecy and proper interpretation as to symbolic language that; defiantly require a term called “Covenant Theology”, or if you like, cross referencing. This entitles prayer, patience, meditating, and a desire for the absolute truth. What covenant theology, means is we use the complete Bible all 66 books. For example, I have been a Christian for over 25 years and some of the truth I found only may have come the other day. My point is when we give our life to the Lord it is a life journey that He begins with us; and we grow spiritually; in some cases this could be over a life time. We should never feed the notion that if we can’t get it right the first few times, we should give up. If your reading this and that’s how you feel right now, I want to reassure you Jesus will not give up on you go to Him always He is with you right now, He loves you beloved. Jesus will never forsake you nor I; if your falling lots, continue to stay close to Him nevertheless, stand, if you get knocked down, stand, stand, stand. It’s not by our strength or power; not so, but by His Spirit. Fight for your right to exist, because, He is still in love with you, and He will wait with you wanting you to get up. Baby steps, Jesus didn’t die to look down upon us and condemn us at every wrong move; not so, the love He has is not the same love we understand. Moreover, everybody grows at different levels and you mean so much to Him. Most importantly those with greater light are no different from those who first come to the Lord. This is why Jesus said, do not judge and you will not be judged. And the same measure you look at someone’s fault, or faith, and church, or looking down on someone boastfully, will your personal judgement be towards how God looks upon you. Love your enemy’s, live righteously, forgive those who did wrong to you, and never bring it up to them again. This is how Jesus forgives us. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. God is Love, John 3: 16. He cares for all of us; most importantly He is not a respecter of persons and is not willing that any should perish, but all come to repentance. We should show ourselves approved unto God by studying His word a little bit at a time. Strive to be the best you can without overworking yourself. Now when reading the Bible keep looking where you can improve your knowledge, relationships, faith, and if you have been blessed with much light and even teach His word, never ever think you know it all and have it figured out; when in fact you or I may be following compromised tradition unscriptural and unsound. Why this is important, well think about how many denominations there are in Christendom alone? So while researching when we read the Scriptures we should be looking for a closer relationship with Jesus; with a desire to appreciate and realize the entire Bible is truth from Genesis to Revelation. And this will also help you to choose a church denomination that Jesus leads you to by understanding truth in its proper interpretation.
       Some find for example the Old Testament is not relevant for them in the understanding of the New Testaments, putting aside books containing otherwise references that unlock the passage of truth pertaining to the subject in question at that time. Both Old and New Testaments work side by side. If you only had one leg it would be difficult to walk. So the Bible is likewise; assuming that the Old Testament was for the Israelite’s and the Jewish nation is a really unwise decision so many fall into; as there are more an excuse not to study reasoning away and withholding from themselves the ability in reaching the stars and Heavens store house of treasures pure truth in other words. God would love to have you receive more and more as you grow. But doubt, old habits, personal views, family, someone’s view or church folk and denominational doctrine, keep them back from growing in grace. These traits may stop you from increasing light the Holy Spirit wants to increase you with. So wherever you worship take time to decipher yourself the word of God, always confirming that what you heard in church is in fact Biblical. Again these and more may lead you to become a leader and less the follower you were in a church not knowing why you go to church in the first place; if that is the case, as for me that was. So why do you go to the church you follow? We all need to ask ourselves this including myself. Some would rather believe anything as long as there in church and they feel optimistic believing their pastor has it all down and understood as you perceive it, and that he would not lead you astray, however, he may be readily rejecting otherwise easy truth made complicated, nevertheless if your pastor or teacher gives you them joy joy feelings weekly all is good right? But is this ok in God’s view? Not so, as I said above, we should not take the stance that leaving it to our church to save us is good enough. No, we need to continually search the Scripture making sure what we here in fact are the oracles ‘of solid truth doctrinally only then can we be grounded and not moved from the storm that is coming and now is. Jesus said we need to build our houses on a foundation that involves structure with faith, strength and love. Our immediate attention depends on it. And in the inspired word of God as the Author of the most powerful book ever, is heard “It is written” in the volume of God’s omnipresents.
        You are a flower most fitted to show your true colors, not to conceal them in false doctrine where you never get the chance to love yourself as God made us to become even during the times of adversity. But if you withdraw from the Sun, you will always remain the same and never grow; insecure, scared, unsure, a follower. We all have true inner beauty that Jesus has given us we are all made with a beautiful mind let’s put it to work and the truth will set us free. This freedom will only truly be experienced when the real truth of God’s word becomes sound, stable, firm, unconditional strength with secure courage, in all faith, and agape, and a fulfilled life with zeal that promises new meaning. Be ye perfect building eternal Excellencies’ with your Heavenly Father who shines down upon you His majesty, and life with the absolute solidness His omniscient longs to give you the confidence you have always longed for. Knowing you really belong to something so much greater, bigger, wonderful spectacular, over and above anything this life can offer. Our Lord has said in His amazing manual, meant just for you, and is an invitation to eternal life yours free. Jesus paid your bill that you may have eternal life forever. Brothers and sisters don’t delay, while He may still be found reach for Him.
        Don’t indirectly or directly suppress your rose peddles, grow in all truth. Stand up to intimidation, brake through, study prayerfully, our ability to learn is as endless as the entire universe is, when learning is concerned; and Jesus will shine His light upon you as the sun is to a flower. Let your colors open also beloved, reach high to the warmth the sun gives. Be invigorated with true unmoved sound truth in its true light and purpose and meaning for us as our God intended it to be. And Jesus will help you shine your colors to others; reflecting radiant beauty, and all will see in you a new you.
        When Moses asked to see God face to face while receiving the 10 Commandments high in the mountains; the Lord said to Moses, I will walk by you, look at me after I walk past you. Moses only saw the back of God as His light would have rendered Moses perhaps unconscious even death. That’s why Moses was not permitted to behold God face to face; but how beautiful God was to Moses by allowing it to happen the way God permitted it to be so; by walking by him. I could imagine how excited Moses felt, however, not until Moses came down from the mountain did Joshua, who by the way, if you’re not familiar with was this next great prophet who took Moses place after God took Moses to Heaven. Now when Joshua waited patiently for Moses to return, that upon seeing Moses; Joshua said, Moses there is a great light that shines from your face. Moses replied, I have seen God, with a look of pure determination and strength, Joshua bowed to Moses, but quickly Moses rebuked this action, saying, do not bow to me Joshua, but only to your God and mine. As Moses and Joshua descended from God’s holy mountain; the children of Israel could not look upon Moses as his face was radiant with Devine light from God. This is typology and would be understood as to a type of light God wants to impart to us. As I mentioned above, though are faces don’t light up, our hearts do. And our lives reflect the indwelling Holy Spirit of truth, yes to all sound truth, and God lives with you and I in faith, and our hearts take on a new beat to the sound of Devine indwelling light our Lord imparts to all who ask as Moses asked. And be it according to our faith then you and I become are a tower of strength, unmoveable, walking in the faith and fear of the Lord as all God’s people from generation to the next have done before us. Some faithful most respectful person’s soldiers, men of stature, true warriors who would rather die than deny their God walking in the fear and strength of the Lord continually, declaring Lord Omnipotent, the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob; Even as the prophet Elijah had said out loud before God consumed his sacrifice by raining firer down from Heaven, in full site of king Ahab and his Baal false prophet worshippers.
        So today we need to ask our Lord to remove all the habits that long suppressed us by the little light we had even telling ourselves negative comments, bad traits all of us have in our life, we sometimes feed ourselves with negativity and subliminally our systems become immune to self destruction. Moreover our inner beauty never develops and our flower peddles never reach God’s throne, the Creator of lights. Yes everything created, made He you, reach for Him. He made you and all we see in the earth; the beautiful sunsets, the hills and valleys with water streams rushing over the rocks, also, the teaming amounts of living organisms both small and great, a reflection of how much God loves you and I. Stop once and a while take the time to look, at everything He made everything seen made He all for us. You are a remarkable created being and throughout the generations there is not one being that is anything close to your own genetic gens. You and I were made in the image of God we should never forget this we are special in God’s eyes. Furthermore, all around us, God speaks to us again through all nature not only around our earth and planet; but when we look up at the night sky science today is still baffled trying to understand the begging’s of life. Yes, be filled with adoration, be in love, and experience a joy no man can buy, nor take away from you.
       Now while Jesus was here 2000 years ago He preformed countless miracles and raising people from the dead, and feeding on two occasions 5000, and if I’m not mistaken another 4000. Whenever He healed someone, He would say “let it be according to your faith”, believe, and it will happen.
       Be humble, with all humility asking God to help you in all you do. Also, Jesus loves children, He instructed us to have characters as the little children as they are innocent, they love running to Him. On one occasion a child ran to Him, He picked the child up and hugged him, commenting, “suffer the little children to come on to me, and forbid them not; for their angels go before the face of God”  Myself, I see my hands around His waist as a child never letting go. It helps me to identify with the person Jesus wants me to be always. He longs for all of us to be this way; Jesus said, “unless we become as the little children, we cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven” Though I have been blessed with much light, I am no different from you; remaining teachable always listening more than speaking understanding this is wisdom. Try to slow down in life, perhaps to pet a dog, or to understand the amazing logistics a simple flower takes to grow and opening up when the sun shines upon it. God gave us, these beautiful little joys, and that we take time to appreciate Him; the longer you examine something most everybody takes for granted, upon doing this, stop, look around and try to see the craziness and busy pace people in this generation are actually doing, running after their dreams, it actually is sad the more you stay away from the world this becomes extremely evident that something is not right in this world. More beautiful is a little flower again His creation. Jesus worded to His disciples that a little Lilly is arrayed more wonderful then any King that has ruled on this world from all generations. Ask as King David asked, He asked God, I want to know the heart of My Lord. One only needs to read the book of Psalms; King David wrote, yes God did bless him with his wish. I am also asking the Lord as King David asked, Jesus, I want to know you more and more, but I’m not worthy to ask God as King David did. Nevertheless I will never give up on Jesus I love Him more beyond words can describe.
        So whatever level you are in your walk with Christ continue in faith building a relationship spending time with Him talk to Him like you’re talking to a good friend on a phone chat or so. Be yourself enjoy His comfort for He is with you, but He will not force you or your decision to accept Him. Nevertheless He longs for you I know this to be very true. I am living proof to all my words; I love you Jesus, Daddy. Yes the minute you invite Jesus into your heart the same minute His covering is upon you and in that moment. He promises that He will never leave you nor forsake you; begin to build a relationship the sooner the better, your life will change. Now remember, life is still life, some Christians early in their walk might experience hardship telling others that their life was not bad; but when they became Christian’s life became more difficult. Later becoming frustrated and throwing the towel in. So be easy on yourself allow for times to become unsettling. Read some of the Old Testament books written by God’s Holy prophets; yes their life was not joyful, in some cases; nevertheless, they remained faithful as they never gave up there calling from His love. These are true heroes, worriers; I call defenders of the faith, one generation to the next. And God called ordinary men just like you and I, you never know, He may have His eye on you. If you have not invited Jesus to live with you or want to rededicate your Love for what He has done in your life this far; this is a suggested prayer for you to read and receive with your heart and invite the King of King’s and Lord of Lord’s to be with you right now. Say,
        Lord my God, thank you for saving me and forgiving me of my sins, help me to be the person you want me to be that I may serve you all the days of my life and honor you always, increase my faith that I may build my dreams, hopes and future with you. Help me to repent of my sins, and walk in the righteousness of your great love. I love you so much Jesus, thank you for dying that I might have life. All this I ask in the beautiful name of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I pray this now and forever Amen, and Amen. God be with all you. AmenGood for you. I am sensing a longing to be with the LORD from you and know that you are pleasing Him.
Please to help you out read Revelation 11:15-19 for that is where JESUS comes. It’s at the 7th trumpet. It’s a Pre-wrath rapture of the church.
JESUS comes in the clouds with a host of His heavenly angels and He will not step foot on the ground, He will be waiting in the clouds and He will at that time call home the church. Then the ones who are alive and remain will follow those who are raised from their sleep (who were dead in their graves). They will all go up to meet Him and those angels in the clouds.
He will not leave us, He will not forsake us, He will come for us, as He promised us He would do so. I will go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am, there you may be also…PLEASE comfort each other with these words from JESUS (YESHUA) his real name.
Blessings…I believe that the puropse of rapture is to rescue the body of Christ from the great tribulation period, which is never occured ever before or after, is going to happen in this end time. Therefore, its proper to believe the timing of rapture immediately before this great tribulation period.Would like to comment more about this subject on the rapture. I have observed that there is dimension of prophesy that we have not discovered. The reason i say this is the fact that we can give scripture to prove both pre and post tribulation rapture. There is a mystery about this rapture we still need to discover.no mystery at all Frank…just a lot of confusion of people who prefer to trust wolves in sheeps clothing rather than study the bible for themselves…Frank….post tribulation rapture can be demonstrated by exegesis. You have to do a lot of EISegesis (reading ‘into’) and hermeneutical gymnastics to get to the pre-tribulation rapture. Anyone who knows anything about bible translation will tell you that exegesis is the most reliable method.sorry…meant bible INTERPRETATION….I believe the rapture will come befoe the tribulation. But the most important thing is to be born-again and be ready for when He does comeI believe that the puropse of rapture is to rescue the body of Christ from the great tribulation period, which is never occured ever before or after, is going to happen in this end time. Therefore, its proper to believe the timing of rapture would be immediately before the great tribulation period outbreak.Fitsurn: Welcome to our discussion. However if you do some research you’ll find your statement is a self-contradiction because the word tribulation always refers in the bible specifically to persecution of the believer . So to reword you’re statement…”I believe that the purpose of rapture is to rescue the body of Christ from it’s designated persecution’.John 16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world YE SHALL HAVE TRIBULATION: BUT be of good cheer; I HAVE OVERCOME THE WORLD.The only thing promised believers in this regard is rescue from Gods wrathRom 5:9 Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from GOD’S wrath through him!A careful reading of Rev shows that the tribulation aka great tribulation begins at the midpoint of the 7 when antichrist sits in the temple of God in Jerusalem (the 4th seal) and sets about persecuting and killing all Gods people. THAT’s the tribulation (aka SATAN’S WRATH) which ends at the 6th seal. GOD’S WRATH begins at the 7th seal and is judgment of the wicked for their treatment of His people in response to their 5th seal prayers. Be very careful about terminology ! Also please take the trouble to read my most recent post.Further to this it is tempting to believe that we are raptured at the 6th/7th seal in order to escape God’s wrath….however….Rev 16:15 which depicts a point way down the line after the start of the 7th seal (ie between the 6th and 7th BOWL) shows that the rapture STILL hasn’t happened by that point (Jesus is priming His people here to stay ready for it). Does that mean believers are still on earth for much of God’s wrath ??? (trumpets 1-6 & bowls 1-6 ??)….yes…but remember how God preserved Israel during the plagues in Egypt and eventually started to ‘make a distinction’ between His people and the Egyptians ?Exod 8:20 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 21 If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them.22 “‘But ON THAT DAY I WILL DEAL DIFFERENTLY WITH THE LAND of Goshen, WHERE MY PEOPLE LIVE; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the Lord, am in this land. 23 I will make a distinction[b] between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.’”Pharoah is a ‘type’ of the final antichrist.ok…hang on hang on…doesn’t it say in Rev 7 (before the 7 trumpets)3 “DO NOT HARM the land or the sea or the trees UNTIL we PUT A SEAL on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” 4 Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.???Isn’t it clear yet ???These 144,000 are unbelieving Jews so they need a SEAL to be especially granted them.HOWEVER believers who’ve made it this far and escaped the mass martyrdom ALREADY HAVE A SEAL (please wake up and smell the coffee) – Eph 1:
When you BELIEVED, you were marked in him with a SEAL, the promised HOLY SPIRIT, 14 who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance UNTIL THE REDEMPTION (for ‘redemption’ here read ‘rapture’) of those who are God’s possession..so that SEAL PROTECTS (from all the trumpets and bowls) the remaining living believers UNTIL THE RAPTURE AT BOWL 6 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why does Rev especially need to point this out when if we knew our bibles as well as we should we’d already be aware of it !!Oh boy, here we go. Please read the post before yours where I explained things in basic details of what will happen.
Agreeing with Irvin the appearing of JESUS will be at the 7th trumpet. It’s a pre-wrath rapture/resurrection which are the same event.
JESUS doesn’t touch the ground when he raptures the church (saints-body of CHRIST etc.). He appears in the clouds, and He calls up the dead from their graves and the ones who are still alive at that time.
This is before the wrath of GOD which are the last 7 judgments (known as the bowl/vial judgments).
Please read the other post for more explanation. Rev. 11:15-19 will tell you that JESUS appears at the 7th trumpet.wandakate: Rev 14:17 Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. 18 Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, ‘Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.’ 19 The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath. 20 They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.This is not chronologically followed by the start of Chapter 15. The former is a reference to the 6th bowl gathering of the wicked armies of the world which occurs later in Chapter 15 (not at the start of the chapter) and because the 2 harvests (wicked and righteous) are in a similar timeframe the rapture therefore occurs after the 6th bowl.Rev 14:14 – 16 depicts the raptureRev 14:
14 I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man[b] with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, ‘Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.’ 16 So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.The following passage which precedes the grape harvest of the wicked  depicts the rapture itself:Rev 14:14 I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man[b] with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, ‘Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.’ 16 So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.But occurs back to back with it THEREFORE the rapture is bowl 6-7 too.Rev 14:14-20 is like hovering a magnifying glass over the 2 Bowl 6 harvests in Ch 15 – You can’t say that the start of Rev 15 follows immediately on the end of Ch 14 any more than you can say that Ch 12 follows immediately on from the end of Ch 11 (which is how Catholics erroneously arrive at the ‘conclusion’ that the Woman clothed with the sun is Mary and is herself the ark of the covenant). Revelation is NOT TOTALLY chronological – some passages are meant as ‘zoom in’ s and sometimes has to flashback or flashforward so as not to interrupt and overly expand the chronological thread in other placesapologies….the 2 Bowl 6 harvests are in Ch 16 not Ch 15The ‘great multitude’ in HEAVEN in Revelation isn’t the rapture. The rapture will occur in THE AIR (CLOUDS) ….there is a BIG difference…The ‘great multitude’ is indicating the completed quota of designated MARTYRS….the rapture is for those STILL LIVINGand yes….this means only a privileged few (note a comparison with Jesus, Elijah) will experience the rapture (ie bypass death altogether). Let’s face it if they’ve gotten this far they deserve it !!!however to clarify further….the rapture event is actually a combined resurrection-rapture which occurs ‘at the last day’ and involves all saints past and present (dead and alive) meeting Jesus in the air (clouds).apologies of course Jesus didn’t bypass death so only Elijah (Enoch also perhaps ?) occurs a complete example of the forthcoming ‘rapture’other refs to indicate tribulation affects only God’s people:Matthew 13:21 “Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when TRIBULATION or PERSECUTION ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.”Acts 14:22 “Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much TRIBULATION enter into the kingdom of God.”Revelation 2:10 “Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the DEVIL shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have TRIBULATION ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”Fitsum, you can believe whatever makes you “feel good” or believe the Word. In Matt. 29:19 Jesus lays out just that tribulation that you describe, worse than anything before or ever will be again. Then in 29 He says “after that tribulation” He will come again to gather His elect. After means after.YES…it is a PRE-WRATH rapture of the church. There is the tribulation (the wrath of satan) on the church which were to be the Seal and Trumpet judgments (everybody will be here). Then the great tribulation (the wrath of GOD) which will be poured out on all of the unrepentant sinners. JESUS will appear at the 7th trumpet, which is just after the 6th trumpet but prior to the 1st Bowl judgment. The church is NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD, therefore they will be removed just prior to GOD’s wrath.
Most Christians do not understand this. They seem to think there is just one great big tribulation but they don’t understand the technicalities of the issue…Maybe this will help.
Seals and then Trumpets, then JESUS appears in the clouds, calls up the sleeping dead souls and all the ones who remained alive at that time up into the air to meet Him and His angels…and THEN the wrath of GOD is to be poured out on all who remained on earth at that time. Then 1,000 years later the ones who were still waiting in their graved (all the unsaved) will be called up to attend the Great White Throne Judgment.
GOD’s children will attend the Marriage Supper of the Lamb when they go with JESUS.
The Kingdom of GOD is on this earth, not out in the atmosphere somewhere unknown, but right here…Would you settle for a refurbished earth? GOD is going to recreate it as it was in the garden of Eden as a paradise for all who followed Him and loved and believed in Him…It doesn’t get any better than that.I tend to agree with the pre-trib viewpoint. In my opinion, if a parents lived their children and they knew a storm was coming, wouldn’t they shelter and protect them? It’s the same way with the rapture. If we are God’s children, he will want to protect us from the evil of the last daysTry telling that to the vast multitude of the faithful who have suffered and been martyred across the millenia…not to mention in our time….!!Rose read 1 Thess 5:9… God will save us from the wrath not the tribulation. The anti-christ also needs to be revealed first.Six events MUST take place before Christ 2nd coming and the Saints being saved:1. One world government ( anti-Christ can not be revealed until this happens first)
 2. There must be a falling away from the church and believing in Christ. Great exodus from the church.3. The anti-christ MUST be revealed (2 Thess 2)4. The Temple MUST be rebuilt ( the Jewish people ALREADY have a model of the new Temple which will be built)5. The anti-Christ MUST desecrate the temple (Mark 13:14,26,27) Scripture talks about having two witnesses for the truth, so also read Matthew 24:15,30. Also Daniel 9:29 speaks of the Temple desecration.6. Heavenly events must take place (Matthew 24:29-31) this refers to the 6th seal, Rev 6:12-13Bring on the 90’s, thats the season I’ll be watching for!  Is that the reason people are not letting go of the 80’s how much longer will this be the fashion, time to relive the1990’s.  I understand why there are doomsday preppers, tribulation will be survival of the best.  There will be a shortage of food and water, you will defiently need weapons and you will be greatful the days are shorter and nites longer. It will be strange and tough times. I hope this makes sense.You should read Joel 2 the whole chapter. It talks about The Saints of God coming back to the earth with Jesus when he comes and touches down his feet. The Saints will each have a glorified body that can’t be killed. So, if they are coming back to earth, they had to be resurected and changed first; which means a pre-tribulation rapture (or gathering together). At least that is what I can figure out.Lois, why does a glorified body imply a pre-trib rapture. Jesus second coming is at Armageddon but the rapture is where He is in the clouds at the 7th trumpet. If you need more ammo ask us and we’ll help.If I may for say,the saints that come with Christ Jesus at His coming,they are already there with Christ Jesus, and shall come with Christ Jesus at His second coming, unto which is Immediately after the tribulation. Many people are being taught in the churches that the tribulation is only 3 an half years,However this is not true, according to  Revelation 9:5,10 Christ Jesus has cut the tribulation to 5 months.and the antichrist does not come until in the middle of the 5 months,unto which begin’s the tribulation of the antichrist and false prophet and the beast. Note that these three are all one and the same Satan.thee antichrist is Satan himself. Satan is the number one adversary of Christ Jesus, Satan is the one who shall come to deceive many by deception that he is Christ Jesus and many shall believe him, Why? Because there are those that are being taught in the churches that Christ Jesus comes first to rapture them out, But it is not Christ Jesus that comes first, but Satan himself that comes first to deceive by deception that he is God and sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God, and all the world shall wonder after him believing that he is God.and by doing so,they have taken upon themselves the Mark of the beast.and then shall appear in heaven the sign of the Son of man in heaven, then shall all that dwell upon the earth shall call for the mountains and rocks to cover them, because of their ashamed of seeing that they have been worshipping the antichrist and not the true Christ Jesus, Notice that in 1John 2:28-“And now, little children, abide in Him; that, when He shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before Him at His coming” You know many Christians shall be ashamed at Christ Jesus coming,to see that they were deceived and found in the worshipping the antichrist. If only they would haved studyed Gods Word for themselves. Instead of listing to man’s teachings.Lois Pyles, the saints are not resurrected,the minute a person close their eyes upon dieing,the Spirit,soul,return’s to God,the flesh body returns to dust.What did God tell Adam and Eve in Genesis, that their body would return back to dust of the earth from where it was taken from.Therefore the minute a person dies,they leave their flesh body and get their glorified body,and return to God.Note that no one is laying in a grave,only the flesh body lays in a grave,But as for you, at death of the flesh body,you that body and return to God in the Spirit.The church will not be in the tribulation. The Church is raptured before the start of the Great Tribulation which is a 7 year period. The Holy Spirit indwells those person who have accepted Christ as their savior. The Holy Spirit is also know as the restrainer of all evil. He will be removed by GOD from the Earth immediately before the Great Tribulation. The Church cannot be left on the Earth without the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Church must be raptured before the tribulation. When the Holy Spirit is removed and the church raptured, the great tribulation starts. This is biblical and not supposition. Read Bible. If you are indwelled by the Holy Spirit you will not make suppositions of when things will happen. You will not confused Jews and gentiles, Christians and non-Christians. All who have accepted Christ during the period of Grace will be raptured before the Great Tribulation for the church will be kept out of the wrath of GOD.Robert some questions.
1) Specifically where in scripture does it say that the tribulation is a 7 year period?
2) Where does it say that the HS is THE restrainer of evil that is removed?
3) If the HS is removed how can the tribulation saints be saved?
4) Is revelation 20:4 a lie?
5) When Jesus said in Matt. 24:29-31 that he comes for His elect “AFTER” the tribulation did He lie?
Look at all the scriptures not just those the pre-trib teachers want you to see.
Keep studying.@ Robert… if you truly believe that rapture will come first before the tribulation and when the tribulation happens and Christians are still around they will then believe they were deceived and turn away from God.  Make sure you read the Bible, The saints will go through the tribulation ( saints are the Christians aka the Church). 2 Thess 2:3, The rebellion and lawless one is revealed (The anit-christ) MUST be revealed. Those who refuse his mark will be PERSECUTED which will likely be the Saints. The Anti-Christ WILL persecute the Saints.Matthew 24:29- IMMEDIATELY after the suffering of those days the sun will darken1 Thess 4:16 refers the sound of the trumpet…17 Then we who are alive…….1Thess 5:9 For God has destined us not for the wrath…….wrath comes towards the end before Christ returns. Six events MUST take place before Christ 2nd coming and the Saints being saved:1. One world government ( anti-Christ can not be revealed until this happens first)
2. There must be a falling away from the church and believing in Christ. Great exodus from the church.3. The anti-christ MUST be revealed (2 Thess 2)4. The Temple MUST be rebuilt ( the Jewish people ALREADY have a model of the new Temple which will be built)5. The anti-Christ MUST desecrate the temple (Mark 13:14,26,27) Scripture talks about having two witnesses for the truth, so also read Matthew 24:15,30. Also Daniel 9:29 speaks of the Temple desecration.6. Heavenly events must take place (Matthew 24:29-31) this refers to the 6th seal, Rev 6:12-13In conclusion, we will be around when the anti-christ, the beast and false prophet are revealed. We will be persecuted by the anti-christ because the Saints will REFUSE the number of the beast, but when the wrath comes ( the worst punishment imposed on NON-BELEIVERS) we will not be around. Sorry, no free ticket, we will be around and the anti-christ will persecute the Saints aka Christians. We will be tested and see if we will hold on to Christ or accept the number of the beast.  Not everyone who believes will go to heaven, because it takes more than just believing. Remember even the devil knows the Scripture and believes in God, but the devil trembles at the word of God. Not everyone will be called to the supper of the Bride.  Christ quotes several times that not everyone will enter the kingdom of heaven.  He quotes, “I do not know you” to those who claim they followed his word.The parable of the 10 virgins who went out to meet the bride. 5 brought their lamps and oil and 5 only brought the lamp. The 5 without oil when back to get oil and missed the bride when he came. He closed the door behind them.Yes, we will go through the tribulation, we will be persecuted, we will be tested on our faith and many will turn away from God at the last day, because they will not be strong enough to see their love ones suffering and will accept the number of the beast.GetReadyInfo.comThe devil has an endtime agenda for popularising the pre-tribulation rapture – namely to catch God’s people off guard and unprepared when it doesn’t happen.Luke 16:15New International Version – UK (NIVUK)15 ………………….What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight.How do you know the Holy Spirit is dwelling in you?Well you realize that people can be serious, and yet be seriously wrong.
The church will actually go through much of the tribulation. You can even asked Irvin if that isn’t the truth.
We are here through the Seal and the Trumpet judgments, and then we will be removed by JESUS at the 7th trumpet of Revelation. You can see that JESUS appears in Rev. 11:15-19. This tell us what happens at that very time, very important passage to read.
JESUS comes pre-wrath or what some call post trib, b/c it’s just prior to the final bowl judgments of Revelation. We will not be here for the wrath of GOD (the final bowl judgments) however we will be here for all the rest, all 14 of them.
I might also mention that the HOLY SPIRIT is not the restrainer. It’s none other than Michael the Archangel b/c he is the guardian of GOD’s church and when GOD tells Michael to step down that is when all hell breaks loose on the earth. Many people think the church is the restrainer and it must be removed prior to the antichrist etc. but that is not a fact, only speculation and hearsay.JESUS said there would be trials and tribulations for us to suffer. He warned us that we would need to endure, to persevere and to overcome the evils of this world. We must keep the faith and not give in to the worldly system of things, and we must remain strong or become strong in the end.
Please study so that you can show yourself approved. And obey the LORD as obedience is the key to all eternity.Wandskate,that is right,alot of people are being taught in the churches that they will be raptured out of before the tribulation starts, by this they are being deceived and do not know it,however if it be true that they will be raptured out before the tribulation, Then how is it that the Lord’s elect are to be deceived up before the antichrist during the tribulation, How does this work?If to what you say is right,can you explain as to how the Lord’s elect are delivered up before the antichrist during the tribulation to give witness to their testimony and the word of God before the antichrist, so how does this work,as to what you say,the believers are to be raptured out before the tribulation starts?I am divorced twice. I am married to my third husband. I know now that I made some wrong choices. I have been a Christian most of my life but at various times I became weak and strayed from Gods teachings. How do I go on? I was married last year. I confessed to God that I knew I was wrong (my divorces and remarriage). Am I required to live a chaste life with my husband now? (meaning no physical contact ever). I want to live God’s word, I am sorry for my actions in the past. I want to be ready when He comesIn John 4:1-26 Jesus is talking to the Samaritan women who had 5 husbands and the man she currently lived with was not her hisband. I would encourage you to read this. Jesus does not condemn her in any way.NO, however He did caution her to “GO and sin no more”. He didn’t want her to repeat her sin over and over again. One marriage is what he intended, not multiple ones, and certainly not same sex ones.Praise the Lord for your desire to live for our Lord Jesus Christ!  Now, how do you live your life now with your present husband?  Find a sound Bible-believing church, or if you are already in one, get together with the pastor or counselor and go through a period of counseling to help you understand God’s direction for your life.  God will surly guide you to His glorious plan for you life!  Praying for you!!!Let me try to help. It is less about what you have done versus what you are doing. Are you making the same mistakes you made with your previous marriages? Have you married a Godly man? Are you both seeking to make Jesus the Lord of your lives? Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a new result. All sin but one can and will be forgiven but you must at some point seek to do things God’s way not yours. If that is what you are doing and you and your current husband are walking in faith and seeking God’s will and work to honor Him in your marriage then you will be blessed. I hope this is where you are heading.HI ALL: Love to all my brothers and sisters in CHRIST. I am not so concerned about the time the rapture is to take place. I am concerned about something I heard a bible scholar talking about the other day. He was saying that instead of looking for a MAN antichrist maybe we should be looking for an antichrist system. All you have to do is look and see that It’s here! And getting worse by the day! The world is going for this system head over heals. Just my thoughts, but I’m staying in my watchtower waiting and listening for the LORD. I’m 65 and have watched the world turn so corrupt, complacent and wicked it makes me sick. I believe WE are the generation that shall not pass till all is fulfilled. I just try to tell people don’t be deceived by this world and satan. Be ready for the LORD He can come any time. Don’t argue about the rapture theory. Get prepared and stay prepared!!!SHALOM from Dan.PS: He’s coming back and he’s close. Get ready. Praise GOD.I’ve said this before….it can seem like nitpicking to go to great pains about the timing but when you think about if you’re expecting to be outta here when all hell breaks loose you won’t bother preparing yourself for the possibility and be easily blown away when it comes.Regarding the MAN…. The language of Jesus (many antichristS) in Matt 24 suggests a plurality and in all likelihoods an antichrist ‘atmosphere’ will be the perfect setting for the MAN to appear (the language of Daniel is unmistakeable in referring to a man of fierce countenance, breaker of the covenant etc….this is very suggestive of an ultimate singular figure)…..also consider this ….if we believe anything but a post-tribulation (pre 7th bowl) rapture then when Jesus doesn’t deliver on our pet theory on the timing and come when we believed He would how do you imagine that would affect our faith in Him in the midst of the biggest onslaught on the faithful in all of history ?…now do you see why the devil has thrown so much confusion into the pot on this matter….if he can get people to believe Jesus will rapture us sooner than He actually will then we’ll likely turn away and distrust Him when He doesn’t come through when we expect !YES exactly. The antichrist will appear, they will still be here, the mark will be presented and people will be angry, some even mad, and they will feel lied to and deceived as well, and THAT is exactly what is going to cause the great falling away of the church.
Scripture tells us that those TWO things MUST happen BEFORE JESUS will appear and call us home.
There will be a rapture at the 7th trumpet and that is just before the wrath of GOD which are the last 7 judgments to fall onto the earth and they are ONLY for the unrepentant sinners. Otherwise everybody’s gonna be here. They aren’t going anywhere they just think they are. A pre-trib view is not biblical, there is absolutely NO foundation there to stand on.wandakate…I have to say I don’t think that will be the sole cause of the great falling away – it may well boost the numbers. If you look even now there are many falling away…..gladly allowing themselves to be moulded and conformed by the world……caught up with liberal tolerance thinkingJesus did refer to the abomination which causes desolation in Matt 24 which is a reference from Daniel and if you look at Daniel you’ll see that that is clearly referring to a ‘HE’ would sets it up in the temple.Dan 9
27 HE will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’[c] In the middle of the ‘seven’[d] HE will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple[e] HE will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on HIM.[f]”[g]It’s refreshing to read article by someone who admits that we really don’t know if the rapture is pre/post tribulation or some time during the tribulation. Your honesty is noted and appreciated.Jay….however we DO know from Jesus no less…Matt 24
29 Immediately AFTER THE TRIBULATION of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:30 AND THEN shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: AND THEN shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall GATHER TOGETHER HIS ELECT (ie resurrection-rapture)  from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.This Jesus using chronological terms leaving us in no doubt when it will be…..what could be plainer ?Curt I don’t find Matt 29 so 29 19 is not there either LOLLWhere are you commenting from? If I said 29 it is clearly an error. Would have been 24:29-31. Sorry if I posted wrong.very sad that that’s the best retort you can muster….I think PRE-WRATH and POST-TRIB may be the same but I’m not positive.
I just believe it’s at the 7th trumpet when JESUS will appear according to Rev. 11:15-19 that is when HE will appear and take possession of this world away from satan who is currently the god of this world. Hopefully that is correct…Wandakate, as I see it, the rapture is at the 7th trumpet and the wrath is in the 7 bowls which follow the 7th trump. Therefore the rapture according to my understanding is both post-trib and pre-wrath. After the wrath we have the battle of Armageddon where Jesus returns to earth to set up the millennial reign.That makes sense and is biblical. The 7th trumpet is when JESUS will appear. This is the rapture, the calling up, or the catching away of the saints. That happens during the tribulation at the 7th trumpet. It’s also known as the 1st resurrection of the saints.
They will go to the marriage supper of the LAMB with JESUS.
THEN, “after” that will be the wrath of GOD and that is the bowl judgments which are the very last 7 to be poured on the earth for all the sinners and they will not escape GOD’s wrath. They will curse GOD and continue to deny Him right up until their death.we agree!I never use the term post trib only because when you try to show a Christian from the bible why it doesn’t teach the pre trib view they get upset because some false prophet on TV told them that the definition of tribulation was Gods wrath.Tribulation is what the world does to us as believers, but wrath is what God will do unto the world after the rapture takes place. I only use the term pre wrath and then show them Matthew 24:29-31 (KJV)YES, Pre-wrath. The end-time staffer said he calls it the post-trib and says its the same thing, but like you I prefer pre-tribulation b/c that is when it will happen, just prior to the “wrath of GOD” being poured out onto the evil sinners, all of those who refused to repent.
Christians aren’t going anywhere until the 7th trumpet of Revelation. Rev. 11:15-19 is the appearing of JESUS to get the saints and to take over the possession of this world from satan (the god of this world).I just noticed that I made a big mistake there. I said pre-tribulation but meant PRE-WRATH, sorry and hope it didn’t confuse people, but I bet it did. I was tired when I wrote it and it was also late at nite. SO Sorry!!!THOUGHT FOR THE DAY……Matt 24:44 So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour WHEN YOU DO NOT EXPECT HIM.is not so much about the doctrine of imminence as much as mass confusion about rapture timingThe rapture is a MINUTE part of the end times but we balloon in into something else because we hope its our ticket outta hereNo, it’s not a ticket out of here, like a get out of jail free card. No, actually the appearing of JESUS (YESHUA) and the 1st resurrection of the dead and the rapture or the catching away of the saints is all the same event, it’s a 3 in one deal.
JESUS comes, the saints are ALL called up to Him who is standing on a cloud and will be surrounded by His host of Angels.
The dead will rise up first out of their graves, the ones alive will follow them all up and will go to be with the LORD. They will at that moment receive their new glorified bodies that will be fit for the Kingdom of GOD, as flesh and blood (as we now are) can’t enter the Kingdom.
We were told to comfort one another with these words. They are comforting, and give us peace. JESUS will come for His own, GOD will send Him at the proper time, according to GOD’s timing and not our timing.
It’s at the 7th trumpet, and it happens AFTER the antichrist, and AFTER the mark of the beast is known. Our faith will be tested, we will have many trials and tribulations before JESUS comes for us. He told us we MUST persevere until the end. We must strive to overcome the evil in the world so that we will be found worthy to stand before the Son of Man…JESUS even told us to pray that very thing, that we would be worthy.
We are going to be judged by our works. JESUS said we are saved by His grace, but we will be judged by our works. James said, our faith without our works is dead. We are to be obedient to GOD and His never-ending 10 commandments, ALL of them. JESUS even told us, “IF you love me, keep my commandments.”
Let’s home we’re keeping them, and that we are worthy.The true Christian is always considered by God to be “worthy’ in His eyes, due to the “atoning sacrifice” of His “One and Only Son” on the cross of Calvary. It is simply a matter of daily “cleansing” of the ‘filth’ of the world, from the believer’s ‘daily walk’ with the Lord, that is the issue that you are speaking to. [John 13:10 New International Version (NIV)]10 “Jesus answered, “Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.”It is called “the blessed hope” of the believer in Jesus Christ. : Titus 2:13 New International Version (NIV)13 “while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,”  Please, refrain from ‘trivializing’ something that is so fundamental to the very core beliefs of Christianity.THOUGH FOR THE DAY…
The Lord says to my lord:[a]
‘Sit at my right hand
    UNTIL I make your enemies
    a footstool for your feet.’If Jesus isn’t to leave the Father’s right hand until antichrist (one of His enemies) is defeated then how can Jesus leave God’s right hand to rapture us in the clouds BEFORE antichrists defeat ???!!!Excellent question, however I needed to read it twice, but I get it.
The antichrist comes before JESUS comes. JESUS won’t appear until the 7th trumpet of Revelation. All of the Seal and Trumpet judgments were judgments that everybody would be here for. The only time we’re leaving the earth with JESUS is when He appears at the 1st resurrection of the dead which is also the rapture or the catching away of the saints. It’s all the same thing, a three in one occurrence.
JESUS appears at the 7th trumpet which is just prior to the last 7 judgments of Revelation which are the bowl/vial judgments and that is the wrath of GOD. Rev. 11:15-19.
Christians just think they’re not going to be here when the poop hits the fan, but they will be.
They’ve been deceived for years into believing a pre-trib rapture, but word is now finally getting out and people are believing the entire TRUTH of scripture and GOD is beginning to open their eyes to the spiritual truth of the word of GOD so that they are not spiritually blinded any longer, therefore they are learning by reading and studying so they will finally know what is and what is not going to happen so PTL for that.I do not now where it is that you get your convoluted sense of ‘end times’ “prophecy” or “eschatology” from, but I assure you, the Scriptures do NOT back up your assertions. I can provide Scriptural “proof” for my assertions, if you so desire. Will you commit to do the same for me?Satan was already ‘defeated’ at the cross of Calvary, by the shedding of the “precious blood of the Lamb”, and by His “death” and “resurrection”. Hebrews 2:14-15 New International Version (NIV)14 “Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil— 15 and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.”; Colossians 2:15 New International Version (NIV)15 “And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.[a]”; Colossians 2:15New International Version (NIV)15 And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.[a] ; Colossians 2:15New International Version (NIV)15 And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.[a] ; John 12:31 New International Version (NIV)31 “Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.” ; Matthew 28:18 New International Version (NIV)18 “Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.(A)”Cross references:Matthew 28:18 : Da 7:13, 14; Lk 10:22; Jn 3:35; S 13:13; 17:2; 1Co 15:27; Eph 1:20-22; Php 2:9, 10There is no rapture. I still don’t understand why people believe that they are to good for persecution! The apostles of Jesus were hunted down and killed for the belief in Jesus and for preaching his words. So what makes the rapture believers better then the men who actually walked with Jesus? It clearly states in the bible that in the endtimes, Christians will be persecuted and killed. Do research on when the whole rapture theory was made. Don’t be fooled with this false teaching of a rapture. The best way for God to see your faith in him is to give your life for him. Not fly away on some magic ship or vanish without going threw the trials and tribulations to prove your faith in Jesus. Wake up people because if you don’t magically disappear then you will have a lot of soul searching to do when the world is crumbling before your eyes. Stop wasting time with false teachings and instead of following what you hear from pastors or priests, do your own research and follow God’s words not man’s.Hi…not quite true…there will indeed be a ‘catching away’ of still living believers – just not at the time most or all believers would hope …It’s very clear…The saved that were dead in their graves arise up and go to meet JESUS in the air, and immediately following them will be the ones that are saved that are still on the earth. This is an appearing of JESUS for his church, the saved souls. The dead and the alive people. There is no other time that I am aware of. If there is, it’s not in scripture.1 Thess 415 According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. 16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 AFTER THAT, we who are STILL ALIVE and are LEFT will be CAUGHT  UP together with them in the clouds to MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR.The rapture is not a theory but it has been pinned down to happen at the ‘last day’ because the resurrection of the dead is at the ‘last day’ and as per the above scripture the rapture of the living must happen AFTER that.ANOTHER THOUGHT FOR THE DAY….
I’ve just noticed something in the above passage…the words ‘….AND ARE LEFT….’. Why does it use these words if there’s a pre-tribulation rapture….left over from what exactly if we are all whisked up anyway together before all hell breaks loose ????  It makes far more sense to say AND ARE LEFT if the numbers have been whittled down significantly
 beforehand (ie by mass martyrdom)……..You are way ‘over thinking’ this aspect of  “are left”. It is a very simple matter of who goes “up” first, and then who goes up immediately after them.YES, that is correct. First the dead saints that were in their graves asleep (waiting on JESUS) will be called up and then immediately those who are left on the ground will be called up to meet them in the air and will be with the LORD at that time.It is an absolute ‘promise’ from our Lord Jesus Christ, that the saints will be “kept from” that coming ‘wrath of God”, that is directed towards “those who belong to this world.”YES, that is very true, but they “will” still be here up and until the 7th trumpet. They’re here through the wrath of satan. They are here until JESUS appears. They are here until the 1st resurrection of the saints and all the graves open where all the saved saints were waiting. Nobody’s going anywhere until that time. So, the bible completely lets us know that it’s a Pre-Wrath rapture of the church, it’s not pre-trib, and it’s not mid-trib, it’s just before GOD wrath of the Bowl judgments which are the final 7 in a series of three.
We were here for the seals, and until the 7th trumpet, but we will be taken out before the last 7.I have chronicled 25 passages of Scripture, that unequivocally state that the Church will be “caught up” (Greek=”harpazo”; Latin=”rapiemur’) in a “rapture” experience. Just ask me, and I will gladly provide you with those Scripture references.Generally speaking it’s usually an argument of “WHEN” the rapture will be, not “if ” it will happen.
So, when is the rapture? How about when JESUS appears in the clouds?
How about at the 7th trumpet?
How about when all the graves open up of all those dead souls that were down there waiting on the last trumpet?
How about when the saved that are still alive after the wrath of satan get taken up into the clouds to be with JESUS?
I think that’s the rapture and it’s a PRE-WRATH rapture, being as it happens just prior to the Wrath of GOD (the last 7 Bowl judgments)…Of course there is going to be a rapture. It’s the same as the “catching away”, it’s the same event as the 1st resurrection of the saints.
JESUS appears in the clouds from heaven. He will be accompanied by a multitude of His heavenly angels.
He will call up-rapture every Christian that was sleeping in their grave, and immediately after that all those that are alive at that time, and they will all “rise up” out of their graves and off the ground to meet the LORD in the air.
They will receive their new spiritual glorified bodies fit for the Kingdom of GOD. Flesh and blood cannot enter the KOG. They will go with JESUS and the angels in their new spiritual bodies. They will have a body such as JESUS now has. The KOG is a spiritual kingdom, not a flesh and blood kingdom like we now have.
Since the church is NOT appointed to the “wrath of GOD”, they will be removed at the 7th trumpet which is just prior to the last 7 judgments (the Bowl judgments).
We (everybody) will be here until the 7th trumpet as there is no secret rapture prior to the tribulation, there is no escape route out without any suffering. We will all realize who the antichrist is, who the false prophet is, and what the mark of the beast is as well.
Do not be deceived. JESUS told us that. They will deceive us if they are able to do so.
Be wise, very wise and don’t be fooled.I meant to include the scripture for the appearing of JESUS and that would be in Rev. 11:15-19. Look at that and see what it says. The graves open, the people are judged, the Ark of the Testament (covenant) will even be seen at that time. This is the rapture, the appearing and the 1st resurrection all wrapped up in one neat package.The rapture (Harparzo) is indeed a biblical truth and our blessed hope. To fully comprehend this doctrine, one must study the Jewish
wedding story which is a parallel to the coming of the Bridegroom
(Yeshua) for His Bride.  The true Church does not go to war nor appointed to go through the wrath of God which takes place in the tribulation period.
One must also study the parable of the 10 virgins.
Five were foolish and five were wise. The foolish were not ready
– no oil in their lamps- there are many people who sit in churches today who are not saved ( born again).
God commanded us to study the bible to show ourselves approved and to ‘keep watch’ as we see the day approaching.
This is the ‘Day of Christ’ – the sudden snatching away of His beloved to Heaven where the wedding takes place.
The  ‘ Day of the Lord’ pertains to the Tribulation period.
Christ comes back with His Bride after the 7 years of hell on earth
We will rule and reign with Him for 1000 years etc etc.Titus 1:14-16 King James Version (KJV)14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.Can you please provide any scripture which states categorically that the church is the bride of Christ.Revelation 19:7-8 Amplified Bible (AMP)7 “Let us rejoice and shout for joy! Let us give Him glory and honor, for the marriage of the Lamb has come [at last] and His bride (the redeemed) has prepared herself.” 8 She has been permitted to dress in fine linen, dazzling white and clean—for the fine linen signifies the righteous acts of the saints [the ethical conduct, personal integrity, moral courage, and godly character of believers].
 Revelation 19:7-8 New American Standard Bible (NASB)
Marriage of the Lamb7 Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His [a]bride has made herself ready.” 8 It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the [b]saints.
Footnotes:    Revelation 19:7 Lit wife
    Revelation 19:8 Or holy onesAgain you make assumptions that scripture says something it does not. You imply that because the white linen is the righeousness of the saints that this clothing that the bride wears is the bride. It is not. Read Rev. 21:2 & 9-10. The bride is the New Jerusalem not the church. Again we ignore the direct completely clear scripture to teach a man made doctrine.I would have to agree with all that you have stated here, except for this particular phrase: “The true Church does not go to war”. According to Revelation 19:11-21, and Revelation 17:14, the “true Church” will absolutely go to war with Jesus Christ : Revelation 17:14 New International Version (NIV)14 “They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.”They will go to war with Him in the battle at Armageddon. JESUS will come out of heaven with His saints, and they (according to John) will be riding on white horses and they will be wearing white garments, pure and clean. They will all ride horses out of heaven for this final battle…The saints will most definitely fight.There will be a rapture……the bible (1Thessalonians 4:16)states we will be caught up in the clouds with Christ. Also read 5:9. For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him.YES, there will be a rapture at the 7th trumpet. It will be just prior to the wrath of GOD. No, the church is NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD and therefore will be removed by JESUS who will be waiting in the clouds of heaven with a host of His heavenly angels (a literal multitude of them). He will NOT touch the ground this time, He will call up His own from the graves and the ones alive. So the ones who were alive and the ones who were sleeping will all go up to meet the LORD JESUS in the air and will forever be with the LORD. The rapture and the 1st resurrection are the same event.We aren’t going to suffer the wrath of GOD, we will only be here for the wrath of satan up and until the last trumpet judgment (the 7th one). Rev. 11:15-19.
     And as you also showed, the scripture says that whether we are awake (alive) or asleep (dead) we might live with Him. Just proving that the dead people (souls) are sleeping in their graves. They “have not” gone yet to be with the LORD, as they are still sleeping in their graves. This isn’t (as people like to accuse) a 7th Day Adventist teaching or a Jehovah’s Witness teaching, it’s actually from the word of GOD, the BIBLE. You just said it’s in 1 Thessalonians. Hopefully people are learning some truth, and not all this watered false gospel that has infiltrated the churches.If you will carefully examine 1Thess. 5:9 and keep it in context Paul is referring to eternal wrath and not tribulational wrath. The same wrath John refers to in Rev. 14.correct, we, the church and true believers will endure tribulation but its not the same as the Great TribulationActually Wayne it is. The “Great Tribulation is the 42 month reign of antichrist and the period of time for the 7 trumpet plagues. This is the same time Jesus called the great tribulation in Matt. 24. No where in scripture is Daniel’s 70th week called the “tribulation”, this is man made. After the tribulation Jesus returns for the rapture and then the 7 bowls of God’s wrath are poured out. After the 7th bowl Jesus returns to earth and fights the battle of Armageddon.Where does the millennium come into this picture (those 1,000 years)?
I think JESUS takes the church with Him and returns after that and that is when He comes on the white horse with the saints from heaven to fight the battle AT Armageddon…tribulation = Great Tribulation = final 3.5 years of the ‘7’. I can demonstrate it (again :() if I really have to…The main event of the first half of the ‘7’ is the signing of the covenant and the rebuilding of the 3rd temple and institution of sacrifices.TRUE…the tribulation is from satan, as scripture tells us that he (the antichrist) who is indwelled by satan comes to make WAR with the SAINTS of GOD.
They will be removed at the 7th trumpet by JESUS (YESHUA) who will come down to get them.
THEN, the great tribulation is the next set of 7 judgments which is the wrath of GOD called the Bowl/Vial judgments. We (the church) are not appointed to the Wrath of GOD…amen and PTL for that.The Jewish wedding teaching is a very young teaching and not historical. Incidentally look at Rev. 10:7, the 7th trumpet and the mystery mentioned, then go to Eph. 3 to see what the mystery is referred to by Paul. The mystery is complete at the 7th trump, the end of Trib. Period.JESUS will appear at the 7th trumpet of Revelation. He comes in the clouds, He calls up the dead saints who were sleeping in their graves. They didn’t know anything. The dead know nothing.
The ones who are still alive at that time will be called up also just after the graves open and the dead rise up. They will all receive their new spiritual bodies fit for the Kingdom of GOD (KOG). They will go to be with JESUS and the angels. Then immediately following that will be the last set of judgments the bowl/vial judgments. They are the actual “wrath of GOD”, which will be poured out onto all the unrepentant sinners that never excepted the LORD, all those who were too stubborn to bow down and acknowledge Him as their LORD and SAVIOR. They will suffer the most and won’t make it.
The rapture and the 1st resurrection are the same event. It’s at the 7th trumpet, making it all a Pre-Wrath Rapture of the church.Matthew 24:3-35 King James Version (KJV)3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:17 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.25 Behold, I have told you before.26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.the ones “left behind” then repent Will endure the Great Tribulation, not the church, the church is not mentioned anywhere in the great tribulation, as a thief in the night to the ones who do not repent but the believer will knowNot mention of the word church is a classic example of EISegesis (reading things INTO scripture)But the words “believers and saints” are, and since both believers and saints = church then the church is present. The false argument that the church is not mentioned is based on to false premises. First that the word “church in chapters 2-3 refers to the church broadly. It is not, it is used as an address (“To the angel of the church at…”). The second is that because it is not used broadly in the rest of Revelation it means the broad church is gone. This is proven false by the use of the term “saints: (13 times) which Paul uses exclusively as a term for the believer and the believer is always the body of Christ which is His church.None mention of the word ‘church’ is a classic example of EISegesis (reading things INTO scripture to suit our own desires). I have an idea that the church is not mentioned because the only organized church around at that time will be a false global church comprising ‘Mother’ (catholic church), ‘daughter harlots’ (fallen away ‘protestants’) and other sundry world religions (‘abominations of the earth’) – see Rev 17-19 for this description. This ‘church’ will be united based on very broad points of commonality and mutual tolerance (true doctrine needs to be ditched in favour of the popes mantra) The true church of Christ will be driven underground due to persecution and martydom hence it only ever refers to ‘saints’ because true believers will be more scattered an unable to organize into Church as we know it. Meanwhile the term ‘Church’ will be held by the false global church.The tribulation is the wrath of satan, and the “great” tribulation is the wrath of GOD. The church “will not” endure the wrath of GOD which is the last 7 judgments (the Bowl judgments) that will fall on the unrepentant sinners. NO, we will be gone by then at the 7th trumpet, when JESUS appears, which is the 1st resurrection of the saints, and the rapture all in ONE event. The ones that are “left behind” as you say are the ones to endure the wrath of GOD. It’s important that we separate them. The church will remain on earth until the 7th trumpet and then go with JESUS when He comes down from heaven and opens up all the graves of the saints that are in them.
They will go to be with Him at that point in time, and then the Wrath of GOD falls onto the earth.The Foolish Are This Great Multitude:And one of the elders ‘answered’ saying unto me, what are these which are arrayed in white robes? And where did they come from? And I said unto him, Sir thou knowest. And he said unto me, these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb . . . They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes (Rev. 7:10-17).          Why did the elder fail to recognize the identity of the Great Multitude at first? The same reason Jesus didn’t know who the foolish were at first: the foolish didn’t know the use of agape love (Matt. 25:12). Meaning again, they didn’t know their God (1 John 4:8), being the practiced will of God—walking in the light of brotherly love.
          It isn’t logical to conclude that the heavenly elder, with his meaningless certitude and reluctance of memory, didn’t know this great crowd of Gentiles even for a moment. Nor is it logical to assume that this elder didn’t know any part of the Gentile Bride arrayed in white. Without a doubt, no heavenly being is the slightest bit ignorant in any of these matters, especially this Heavenly Being.
          When the foolish remain behind, their thirst and hunger for the ways of God will dramatically increase. According to John, and akin to the foolish being repentant, this great multitude “shall hunger no more, neither thirst.” No wonder, then, that John tells us that the Lamb shall feed them, which fact constitutes the marriage of His remainder Bride. In addition, this is the reason why the Spirit and Bride say come—the Bride says it to the remaining Bride:
And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God (Rev. 19:9).There are several identifying points earmarking the Great Multitude:
1.) The Great Multitude consists of all peoples. As a matter of fact, these are triumphal Gentile saints from all nations, which factor identifies them as the living foolish of the Church. As we should know, judgment comes to the Household of God before it goes to Israel or any other nation. Furthermore, no people other than the living Church can go to Heaven and marry the Lamb, which act in itself is to eat at the Wedding Feast. Now this is not just a good point. It is an inescapable biblical fact!2.) Gaining victory over their dire circumstances, this multitude came out of the Great Tribulation. Diversely, the wise of the Church won’t be cast into that adversity (Matt. 25:1-13; 1 Thess. 5:6; Rev. 2:5, 2:16, 2:22, 3:3, 3:10, 3:20, 7:9-17).3.) The identity of the Great Multitude initially escaped the elder, however, upon questioning the elder he had an instant and calculating recall; and immediately answered His own questions. Thus, by no means are these baby converts in the Tribulation. If that were the case, the elder without any kind of hesitation would accept them. Note: If these were the entirety of the Great Tribulation converts, who then are the saints whom the Beast will overcome and kill (Rev. 11:7)? Who must also be faithful unto death (Rev. 2:10)?4.) In many good manuscripts, the word “sir” is Lord. Therefore, the verse really reads, “Lord, thou knowest,” instead of “Sir, thou knowest” (Rev. 7:14). This elder, who by any standard is not ignorant, is really the Lord Jesus Christ; and He will ultimately know the foolish, whereas in the parable He didn’t.5.) “They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore.” Left behind, only the foolish of the Church will hunger and thirst for truths that entitle them to the Wedding Feast of the Lamb, not new converts. Note: The very presence of the Great Multitude in Heaven before the opening of the Seventh Seal (Rev. 8:1) flies in the face of Second Coming Only Theology.6.) Upon Israel’s last harvest, the Feast of Tabernacles, the people would rejoice before the Lord while waving palm branches. Symbolically, this was a remembrance of being delivered from Egypt to the wilderness (Lev. 23:34-43). The nation of Israel was to celebrate the yearly Fall Harvest by living in booths, meaning tents for one week; remembering their ancestors experience as tent dwellers or nomads in the wilderness. Similarly, the palm branches in John’s Revelation passage signify the final harvest of the present Pre-Tribulation Church (the Fall Harvest), or the believer’s deliverance from the trying times of the Great Tribulation (the wilderness) to the true Promised Land of Heaven. Being a celebration of the final harvest marked by tent dwelling, outright tells the foolish that they need to crucify the affections of this world in the Great Tribulation.7.) Not so strangely, in another Revelation passage we find that the Great Multitude is the Bride of Jesus Christ (Rev. 19:6-7). These, who also bear the same name, the Great Multitude, are part of Christ’s Bride, the remaining foolish of the Pre-Tribulation Church.8.) Ironic as it may seem, the soiled robes of the Great Multitude reflect the robes of Christ’s righteousness initially, yet stained through time by false doctrine and fleshly behavior. Otherwise, if these weren’t proper wedding garments this multitude would be cast out of Heaven (Matt. 22:11-14).  Note: Most importantly, if these were brand new converts (deep Tribulation saints) they would have the perfect and flawless righteousness of God by faith without the law (Rom. 3:21), and their robes would not be soiled. Thus, this Great Multitude with soiled robes can be none other than the foolish of the Church!9.) By trusting in religiosity and not growing in the faith, the foolish have soiled their garments (Rev. 16:15). In clear terms, the foolish will have a need to wash their mired robes in the blood of the Lamb, which washing (by the context of John’s passage) will provide clean and white garments for the Wedding Feast. In complete dissimilarity to that of the foolish, the wise will be like Christ upon His initial appearance, seeing Him as He is (1 John 3:2). Again, the wise will have no need to wash their robes—they have abided through thick and thin in the faultless righteousness of God ever since receiving the Lord as their Savior:
GetReadyInfo.comYou did a good job of ‘reading between the lines’ of Scripture, and ‘interpreting’ them to fit your own way of viewing things. Your statement: “Thus, the rapture of the church occurs just prior to God’s wrath.”, is an apparent contradiction to your teaching of a  “Post-Tribulation’ rapture of the Church. How do you reconcile the two? What comes “Immediately After the Tribulation”, is the “gathering” of the Old Testament saints, or “the elect” (both the living and the dead), not the New Testament Church Age saints. The Church has already been “caught up” (the “rapture”) before the ‘Tribulation Period’ ever begins. If you would desire the actual Scriptural “proof” of my assertions, I am ready, willing, and able to provide you with that, any time you wish to request it of me.There are 16 main Scriptural passages involved in this “proof”, with many more specific references in the Biblical record to “back-up” the event ‘chronology’ of the ‘end times’. I will be more than happy to include “The Five Reasons for the Pre-Tribulation Rapture of the Church” study document, if you so desire. Here would be a ‘foretaste’ of that document for your inspection ; “The five Bible verses which categorically state that the Church will be “kept from” the wrath of God” : Revelation 3:10; Romans 5:9; 1 Thessalonians 1:10; 1 Thessalonians 5:9; John 5:24.Timothy, post your arguments with scripture and I will rebut each one with scripture. Your error above is an assumption that the trumpet plagues are the wrath but they are not. Revelation clearly states that the bowls are filled with “the wrath of God”. Jesus gives us the clearest statements which you can read in the post just below. Read Matt. 24:21 where Jesus says there will come a tribulation greater than anything that has ever happened or ever will happen again. Since nothing will be ever worse than the judgement of the four horsemen and the 7 trumpets of Revelation, this is what Jesus was describing. Then in verse 29 He says He will return for His elect AFTER this tribulation. His elect are the church not the Jewish people. Be careful to read what God wrote and not make interpretations to fit your opinion or desire.The church will certainly be kept from the actual “wrath of GOD”. That is the last 7 judgments, which are the bowl/vial judgments. The church will endure the tribulation until the 7th trumpet and at that time (Rev. 11:15-19) JESUS will “appear” and rapture-call up the saints from the grave and from the earth at that time. This is the very same event as the 1st resurrection of the dead.
The church is not appointed to the “wrath of GOD”, therefore they will be removed just prior to the pouring out of the last 7 judgments.
The entire tribulation was and will be the wrath of satan (allowed by GOD of course) and the great tribulation is the wrath of GOD on the unrepentant sinners.Timothy, your confusion about the post-trib/pre-wrath position stems from the mistaken belief that the tribulation must include the 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls. Scripture does not say this just as scripture does not define the tribulation as 7 years. Only the “Great tribulation is defined as 42 months and the 7 trumpets occur during this time. once you understand that the 7 bowls are not part of the tribulation then the post-trib/pre-wrath position not only becomes clear but now best fits scripture.Leave Timothy aloneThe rapture its 7 years before the second -caming;then the the maarriage supper of the Lamb.Al, if you look closely at the time line, the tribulation ends with the rapture/first resurrection, then the marriage supper in heaven as the bowls of wrath are poured out on earth and then the second coming to fight the battle of Armageddon and set up the 1,000 year reign.AH…ya hit the target…The tribulation is the wrath of satan (not GOD). The rapture/appearing of JESUS/1st resurrection, are ALL one big event. All happen at the same time. And then as you said the marriage supper of the LAMB (JESUS) will be in heaven while the Angel is pouring out all of the bowl judgments on a world full of unrepentant sinners. The 1,000 years will pass and then the sinners that were still waiting in their graves will come up to be judged and thrown into the lake of fire with the devil, the false prophet and the antichrist. That’s when JESUS will appear on a white horse with ALL of His saints from Heaven and that is when the battle AT Armageddon will be.
First time (at His appearing) He will come with a host of heavenly angels and they will ALL be in the clouds. He “will not” touch the ground this time. He will call up all those who are in their graves, and the living who are still on the earth at that time, (known as the 1st resurrection and the rapture of the saints). When JESUS comes at the 2nd coming He will ride the white horse and this time He will step foot on the ground. He will NOT be with angles, but with ALL the saints that had been with Him in Heaven for the 1,000 years. They will attend the Great White Throne Judgment, and then the battle and satan will be thrown down for good. Satan loses in the end…PTL.When the pre-trib rapture fails to materialise those who pinned their hopes on it will feel like someone stood up on a date…only many more times worse. The thing is though Jesus won’t be standing anyone up. Jesus and the rest of the NT makes it crystal clear when the rapture occurs, It’s our flesh that resists the truth because it’s an unwelcome reality. Study the bible for yourselves and lay ALL your preconceptions/favourite ear-tickling ‘teachers’ aside. Time to wake up Church !Great Job brother Irvin. This may be the best “basic timeline” I have witnessed. I would have liked to hear you touch on the Millennial Temple at the end. As you probably know it will be established just as the last 9 chapters of the Book of Ezekiel says it will. “People gotta eat”. May Father bless your Prophecy Institute in Jerusalem. You are correct about the coming Revival especially in Israel. I have changed the “Keep and Share” link to my Timeline I sent Brother Dave. I have included my understanding of how all of the Isaiah prophecies fit into the timeline. (65 year prophecy) (70 year prophecy) (time it takes a baby to say mama dada) (1 Year and some days Prophecy) ect…. I have also placed all “How Long Countdowns” onto my timeline. I hope you will consider it and please make me explain my understanding. May Father bless your labor and here is the link: http://www.keepandshare.com/doc4/58711/70th-week-aug-2015-xlsx-40k?da=y My email address is on the timeline. If you have folks starting your ministry in South Carolina please let me know.I noticed here that several comments are still sitting here waiting moderation. Today is the 25th and they were written a week or so ago. Are they going to be printed soon?Thank you, all that you have said has been very helpful. I am beginning to understand more fully.but the Bible states that we ( the believers) will not endure the Great tribulation and that during the great tribulation no mention of the church is made, so I believe that there will be the pretrib rapture which could happen either before or after the Psalms 83 war and or the Gog and Magog war. one or both may occur but before the antichrist takes power we (the believers) will have been taken, and I further think that the great delusion that God brings on man, satan will take advantage of this and as you well know, we have been pre conditioned to think aliens are real, what a great cover up story for the antichrist to use as to why all those bad Christians are now gone and why now the rest of those people (Israel and other late comers) need to be removed so that when the aliens return the world can live at peace with the aliens, but when the “”second coming”” of Jesus comes and Israel is still here, the world will make war with these aliens (Jesus and the kingdom of God) aka (battle of Armageddon)
WLGThe tribulation is not the wrath of God, No where does it say that the believer or the church avoids the tribulation. Since it is Jesus Himself that says He comes back for His elect “AFTER” the tribulation you are calling our savior a liar. Be careful. Base your position on a thoughtful study of all scripture on the subject and then decide. Don’t defend what you have been taught, defend what you know!Being as satan is the god of this evil world the tribulation is indeed from satan as he causes the antichrist to come and make “war” with the saints.
That tribulation on the saints will last until the 7th trumpet in which JESUS will then appear for the church, which is the rapture and the 1st resurrection all wrapped up into one big event.
See Revelation 11:15-19 and that is the rapture. It’s a pre-wrath rapture b/c JESUS won’t come until the end of the trumpet judgments (the 7th one). After that immediately will be the Bowl judgments and that is the “great tribulation” which is the wrath of GOD.
Now, the church is NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD, therefore it’s removed just prior to it (the bowl judgments. They are going to be poured out by a angel onto the unrepentant sinners.
Satan hates Christians and his wrath will be nasty but not as brutal as GOD’s will be on all those who denied Him and were living in sin and flaunting it when He came.
So, we have a tribulation and a great tribulation but the actual rapture, the appearing and the 1st resurrection isn’t UNTIL the 7th trumpet, it’s not pre-tribulation. It’s just before the wrath of GOD calling it Pre-wrath or post trib whichever, they mean the same.Was wondering where is he Holy Spirit in all of thisI think wandakate is the real deal on here and I have followed her on other Christian Blogs..Thank you for your great teachings miss WK..no it say we are not to receive Gods wrath, the Great Tribulation is the wrath of Satan, the Great Tribulation begins when Satan is cast out of heaven for the last time “Satan having great wrath for he knows he has but a short time”I tend to agree with the pre-millennial pre-tribulation Rapture view. Here is a very good article that John MacArthur wrote. It is quite in-depth. The main points I would like to point out is the use of the work ekklesia. It points out that the Church is separate from Israel. http://www.gty.org/resources/sermons/1324/will-the-church-go-through-the-tribulation-part-1John please refer to the below scriptures and then tell me God is minded to to always consider the Church and Israel as absolute distinct entities:-EPH 2“Jew and Gentile reconciled through Christ”11 Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called ‘uncircumcised’ by those who call themselves ‘the circumcision’ (which is done in the body by human hands) – 12 remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.14 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 15 by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself ONE NEW HUMANITY out of the two, thus making peace, 16 and in one body to RECONCILE BOTH OF THEM to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility. 17 He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. 18 For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.19 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household, 20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. 21 In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. Rom 11
17 If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot(GENTILE), have been GRAFTED IN among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root(ISRAEL), 18 DO NOT CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE SUPERIOR to those other branches.Forgive me, but I don’t quite understand. If you are saying that there is a distinction between Israel and the Church, I would agree. The Bible makes it very clear that there is a distinction between Jew, Gentile, and the Church. I do not believedispensationalism sounds impressive and clever but it’s nevertheless wrong……..has God put His dealings with Israel ‘on pause’ in this so called ‘Church age’ ? Kindly disregard the re-creation of Israel in 1948 and the mass re-gathering of Israeli’s back to their homeland since.Hi, Kev
I find it hard not to respond to your post, that mentions the miraculous resurrection of the nation of Israel in 1948 (and, I might add, of the nearly as miraculous liberation of Jerusalem in 1967).  Not only are this amazing events from an eschatological viewpoint; but they have become the central fact of modern history, occupying the vast majority of deliberations and resolutions of the United Nations.  It is odd indeed, for God’s Christian people to ignore the immensity of these events — and the horrendous ignominity of the Holocaust that immediately preceeded them.
I reject replacement theology, which was at the root of the Holocaust.  My personal take on the subject is that the Jews and the Christians are the “Two Witnesses”, the two peoples who a heritage rooted in personal contact and covenant with the God of Israel.  I’ve posted my beliefs concerning the “rapture” elesewhere in this discussion.
Shalom shalom 🙂Michael I agree with everything else you say here but I think it’s abundantly clear that the two witnesses are very clearly 2 God appointed individuals (though their exact identity is unclear). It’s very clear you have a passion and revelation for how God views Jew and Gentile in relation to each other but to arrive at your interpretation of the two witnesses is taking it a little too far.Sid Roth in his book The Incomplete Church, tells us that we are grafted into the tree of the Jewish roots. It’s “one new man” according to him, and that when it  (the bible), speaks of being in unity, it’s speaking of the Jews and the Gentiles as one new man. It’s got “nothing” at all to do with the new One World Religion that is coming called “Chrislam”. The Pope is spearheading this, and wants to join the Catholics with the Muslims and the Christians to form a One World Religion where they will all be united and believe the same things. Apparently the Pope is now saying that Allah and the GOD of heaven and earth is the same. It’s in the making now. Kenneth Copeland, Joel Osteen, and James Robison have met at the Vatican to discuss this, along with a Muslim cleric. The plans are on the board to do this, it’s just a matter of time. Rick Warren also is in agreement with this new religion. I might be wrong, but I would think the two witnesses would be Elijah and Enoch. So, if we’re alive we will see, if not, then that was the LORD’s decision. Without His breath of life, we’re gone. He is in total control.As I’ve said previously MYSTERY (RCC) BABYLON (Rome) the great MOTHER (RCC) of HARLOTS (fallen away ‘protestants’) and ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH (many or all non Judeo-Christian religions)I rest my case:http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34960971I agree it’s not the Jews and the Christians, impossible. The bible describes them as my TWO witnesses (only two), not a multitude (of Christians and Jews). They will both appear in sackcloth, they will preach or prophecy for 3.5 years. They will both be killed eventually and will rise up to heaven in bodily form. Impossible for it to be anything else but 2 people…most likely Elijah and Enoch, or one of them with Moses.I’ve updated my view of HARLOTS below to consist of Jews AS WELL AS  ‘fallen away’ protestants. Note also there are a number of false gospels floating around now (being promulgated by very Charismatic figures in the church finding great success):1) Pre-trib rapture
2) Eternal security
3) False gracePlease free to add any others you can think of. The overall aim of satan is to bring in dilute self help morally bankrupt liberal comfort loving Christians in their droves in readiness for the pope to present them as part of the church of the antichrist (they’ll cave in immediately at the merest whiff of possible persecution).That’s what happens when converts start to matter more than disciples (the quest for perceived ‘success’)…..Hi, KevThis is in response to what you said to me about the Two Witnesses.  There is nothing in Revelation or elsewhere, to specify that these were two individuals.  Here’s what it says about them:
Revelation 11:
[3] And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
[4] These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.
This is obviously a reference to:
Zech. 4:
[11] Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?
[12] And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?
[13] And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.
[14] Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.
The two “anointed ones” in Zechariah’s time were (1) Zerubbabel, mentioned just before this passage, a son of David in the line of royal succession, and (2) Joshua the High Priest, spoken of in:
Haggai 2:
[1] In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,
[2] Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
[3] Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
[4] Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:
[5] According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.
[6] For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
[7] And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.
The three “anointed ones” in the Bible were the high priest, the king and the prophet.  Haggai, of course, is the prophet in this case; and he designated which “anointed ones” would have their place in the last days:  the son of David, representing Messiah, and the high priest, representing the Torah-faithful Jews.
The following may be a bit esoteric:  There are 24 elders in the New Jerusalem, forming an “outer ring”.  Within that ring are the four ch’ruvim, the guardian spirits around the throne.  Inside that circle are the throne, upon which God sits in a figure; and before him the Lamb, who symbolizes Messiah.  He holds the seven lights of the seven churches, the “second menorah”; and as part of the church, we identify as his body.  The twenty-four, on the other hand, judge the nations.  Twelve of them are certainly twelve apostles:
Matt. 19:
[28] And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Who, then, are the other twelve?  They may represent judges of the twelve tribes who were “sealed” during the Fifth Trumpet period.  At any rate, the 24 are OUTSIDE of the ch’ruvim:  They are not with us and the Lamb; they are judges of the nations, the gentiles.  They also are collectively, in my judgment, the “two witnesses” of God to the world.Michael S: I admit there is a difficulty with Revelation because it contains a mix of the literal and the symbolic (and I see where you’re coming from) and we need to be able to discern which is which. The simplest proof I can give you is that Rev 11 refers to the two witnesses as “these two prophets”. If you look at the Greek grammar behind the form of ‘prophets’:-
Rev 11:10
profhtai
prophEtai
G4396
n_ Nom Pl m
BEFORE-AVERers
prophetsNow Greek is not like French which has fixed gender for each noun. In Greek the form of the noun indicates the gender of any who ‘are’ the noun wherever the noun represents (a) human(s) – wherever that occurs. Now the clincher in this particular case is that the form of ‘prophets’ here is shown as ‘Nominative masculine – Nom… m’.
Now the Jewish nation and the Church are ALWAYS  referred to as ‘Feminine’ e.g. the Bride of Christ / Ezek 23.
Even the church is referred to as feminine (this is how, for example, we know that the great Harlot and her daughter Harlots are both referring to bodies of people formerly covenanted to God but who go on to ‘prostitute’ the truth and their affections):- In Eph 5:25….ekklhsian
ekklEsian
G1577
n_ Acc Sg f
OUT-CALLED
ecclesia i.e. f = feminine.
Therefore the ‘two prophets’ cannot be the Jews and the Gentiles My online Greek grammar source is http://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinearHi, KevYou are the Greek grammarian, not I.  From what you say, I would imagine that individuals are generally put in the masculine grammatical gender, and groups (such as churches or nations) in feminine.  Since the “witnesses” are metaphoric “individuals”, therefore, I would expect them to be in the masculine gender.  This should apply to metaphors as well as to literal individuals.Whether one is to consider a passage metaphorically or literally, depends on the context.  As a rule of thumb, I try to consider a passage literally unless it would make more sense to think of it as a metaphor.  I have obviously chosen the latter route in this case, and you have chosen the former.  Time will tell, which is the correct path; but to be on the safe side, we should both consider both.Shalom shalom 🙂Its a lovely fairytale!The pre-tribulation rapture is the only fairy tale. The events leading up to the real (post tribulation) rapture will be anything but a fairytale but will be very welcome when it comes around !Kev, do you remember when Jesus asked them if your child asks for a fish do you give them a stone–he also said that you ( people of the earth ) being evil give good gift imagine what God can give you——i have always look at the rapture this way–if you had a child and knew before hand that a great calamity was to happen where they were–would you try to warn them or better take them to a safe place–if you would why would you believe that God would allow you to go through the tribulation where there is no mention of the father in revelations from the time the scrolls are opened till the end or about chapter 22 in revelations–read  the last book and compare it to another book  our father is mentioned many times in other books of the new testamentExcuse me, but I do believe you have missed entirely Rev. 11:15-19 which is when JESUS CHRIST appears. The graves are opened, the saints will be judged. The ark of the covenant will be seen. Everything happens here at this last 7th trumpet. Nobody goes anywhere until then. JESUS comes in the clouds and he takes possession of the world from satan at that time.
Sorry you missed that.A fairytale? Are you so sure.Read 2 Peter 16Shut up! If it’s a “Fairy Tale”, then why are you on here. For some attention, pathetic.Oh my…with an attitude like that, I’m surprise that Endtime.com even allowed this to be printed. This is a Christian sight, not people that say things like that to others. Where is your decency and respect?According to the Bible without controversy, rapture comes after the great tribulations. If contacted, l have the notes of serial events of end-time. Thanksthat is not so , and if it is , why would the Lord need the Great Tribulation,to show Himself real , then those who didnt believe before hand ,gets a 2nd chance, thats showing favor ,and God doesnt do that… Hmm , so why then would ANYONE ,really need to follow the Lord , and have any Faith/Relationship , if they are gonna go through the Tribulation anyway?? We that first believed didnt have ANY visual proof ,thats why trust and faith is so important ,whereas those others believed , because they are seeing God and His judgements……Look at it like this ,heres 2 people….. ,”oh i dont believe in Jesus” ,(the other person says)” i do”, (the other says) ”im not gonna follow Him, I dont need saved ,you cant prove there is a Jesus” (the other person) ”well i am, i have Faith in His word ,i dont need to see Him”……you get the point , the Lord has the Tribulation for those who didnt first believe ,and the Tribulation is THEIR ,2nd chance , one of our rewards is NOT having to go trough the suffering of the Tribulation…If this is true, Why did Jesus say He was coming for His elect after the tribulation? If believers are in the tribulation *even 2nd chance people as you call them) then a believer = church. When did Jesus divide His church into two groups?It’s a nice story, but unfortunately it’s not real. It sounds like part of the “feel good gospel”, where they think they’re not going to be here for anything bad. People think they’re leaving before the antichrist and the presentation of the mark, but JESUS didn’t tell us that. He said “after” those days, NOT before. That is our time of obedience. Our time of trials and testing to be sure that the LORD has His special people, the bride of CHRIST. We are saved by grace, through faith in GOD, “but” we will be judged by our works. Our works is our deeds, our loyalty, our obedience, our actions. Our obedience is to make it through the tribulation which will be brought on by satan b/c he will be indwelled into the man of sin, the antichrist.
And scripture tells us the man of sin comes to make WAR with the saints of GOD, and that’s us (the church).
We still love Him and trust Him, and we believe in Him but we also will need to “OBEY” His word and keep His commandments. He did say, “IF you love me, keep my commandments.” And, “Not everyone that says to me, LORD, LORD, will enter the Kingdom of GOD, but only those who “DO” the will of the FATHER…
He wants our allegiance and our obedience.
There is no easy route to Him. IT’s a very narrow road, and it says only a few will find it.
Meaning out of 9 billion on the face of the earth maybe 2 billion or so will make it, maybe not even that many.
Read Rev. 11:15-19…the rapture, the appearing of JESUS and the 1st resurrection of the dead are all the same event…JosephI’m not sure where you get your ideas from but they’re not from my Bible. The big problem with the west is:1) We’re far too cossetted
2) We’re surrounded by an overabundance of ‘teachers’ who tell us what our flesh wants to hear because:-1) It’s popular
2) It’s profitableGet back to the Bible ,bin all your preconceptions and then come with an open heart for the truth – Jesus never disappoints under these circumstances.Oladetohun S.O, Please kindly forward the “notes of serial events of end-time” to my mail ([email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */) I really need to glance through. Thank you.The Rapture is the same as the 1st resurrection and the appearing of JESUS in the clouds with His host of heavenly angels. It has to come before the wrath of GOD. The rapture come AFTER the tribulation, (which is satan’s wrath), but “BEFORE” the great tribulation, as they are two separate things. Seal and trumpets are the tribulation (and everybody’s here), but the great tribulation is great b/c it’s the final act, and it’s the wrath of GOD upon a dying and sinful world that was left full of unrepentant sinners.I would like to know about the multitude that came out of the great tribulations… is thus before or after the rapture?AfterDonnieMany mistake the great multitude to be the rapture but there are key indicators that they are not the same amongst them are:-1) They appear in heaven (not the clouds)
2) It is exclusively comprised of those having passed through the tribulation whereas the resurrection-rapture consists of all believers.If you look back to the 5th seal (Rev 6?) you’ll see the saints under the altar were told to wait unitl the full number of martyrs (just like them) had been reached before expecting judgment to come. Then as one of the events around the 6th seal you see a great multitude in heaven. It’s a no brainer to me that this is that ‘full number’ having been reached and therefore the judgments can proceed (7th seal + ). There is some debate within this site as to whether or not the rapture occurs just before all the bowls or before the 7th bowl (it’s clear to me that it is the latter) but since the 7th seal marks the start of the 7 trumpets and the 7th trumpet marks the start of the 7 bowls then it is very clear that the great multitude (martyrs in heaven) precedes the resurrection-rapture (by some time).Kev, if the rapture before the 7th bowl is so clear to you would you lay it out in detail for the rest of us.see later postIf you want to back up and read my comments you will see that the rapture happens at the 7th trumpet which is just “before” the 1st bowl/vial judgment.
We are NOT appointed to GOD’s wrath, therefore we won’t be here for that. They are going to be the last 7 judgments. JESUS will come for the church, the dead and the alive at the sound of the last trumpet.It has to be AFTER. JESUS isn’t appearing in the clouds until the 7th trumpet. The tribulation will come until that point, then JESUS will come, and immediately following the removal of the saints (as they leave with JESUS and His angels), then it’s the Wrath of GOD, which will be the last “bowl judgments”, to be poured out onto all of the unrepentant sinners. GOD’s wrath is “last”, and that why it says the church is NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD, because JESUS removed them just prior to that time. WE (the church) won’t be here for that wrath, but we are here for all the rest until the 7th trumpet. Times almost up actually. It’s a PRE-WRATH rapture of the church.That was supposed to say…the tribulation WON’T come until, sorry for the typo.the great tribulation will start after Christs comes for his churchATTENTION EVERYONE :The Rapture will be Pre-Wrath.Yes, after the 7th trumpet and before the 1st vial.YES, as far as I can see JESUS will appear for the saints and call up the ones in the graves and the ones alive at the 7th trumpet Rev. 11:15-19…then the next thing will be the Bowl/Vial judgments and that is the wrath of GOD. There are 7 of them, that will fall onto the unrepentant sinners and the church will be gone by that time as they left at the 7th trumpet with JESUS.
The church is not appointed to the wrath of GOD.If by ‘wrath’ you are referring to the 7th bowl then I agree with you as that is the only one of all the trumpets and bowls we simply HAVE to be outta here for (think cities collapsing and hundred pound hailstones). All the trumpets and bowls are targeted at the wicked and God affords protection to believers (via their ‘seal’) still on earth through all but the 7th bowl (I’m sure God could still protect us through 7th bowl events but they’re a bit too mega and it’s easier just to take us up). The call to readiness for rapture from Jesus Himself occurs between the 6th and 7th bowl.…and repentance opportunities have expired by the end of the 5th …Based on what?see my later postThe closest foreshadow of the pre-7th bowl rapture I can come up with is the angels forcibly catching Lot awayfrom Sodom and Gomorrah and then the fire and brimstone falling after he is clear …Why does there need to be some foreshadowing?What are you talking about here? I didn’t say anything about a pre-7th bowl rapture or anything else.
I said that JESUS will appear at the 7th TRUMPET, and that’s the last one. Then “AFTER” the church leaves the earth when JESUS appears, “then” the Bowl judgments will fall onto the unrepentant sinners and they will fall from the 1st one to the last one and there are 7 of them.
The church is here until the 7th trumpet.
According to Irvin’s ministry we’re already at the 6th trumpet right now, so it’s not as far in the future as people seem to think.Because the OT is full of types and ‘shadows’ (eg Hebrews , 1 Cor 10) and ‘ALL scripture is inspired by God and is useful for …..instruction…..’ (Tim)………to me it’s clear pharoah was a type of the final antichrist having the monopoly on food sources and oppressing God’s people.Also many of the trumpet and bowl judgments are reminiscent of the ten plagues. These two being the case it’s not much of a stretch to me to consider that just as the Israelites were still around during the plagues (though ‘kept’ from them) so shall Christians still be around for a good part of the judgments (though kept from them). Apologies if I’ve taken all this as ‘read’ but to me it’s obviousYes, they will be around for ALL of the seal and trumpet judgments b/c they are the wrath of satan. The last 7 are the wrath of GOD, and they aren’t for the church. The church will leave the earth at the 7th trumpet. JESUS will appear, the graves will open, this is the 1st resurrection and they will all be called up (raptured) so all three are at the same time…
1. Jesus appears w/ angels in clouds.
2. The 1st resurrection of the saved dead occurs.
3. the rapture of all the living saints.
All one BIG event…Christians have been told unfortunately that they won’t have to face the gloom and doom of the dreaded antichrist, however that’s isn’t to be found truthfully in scripture.
Rev. 11:15-19 tells the story as well as 1 Corinthians 15:51-52.…which in turn helps me make sense of Jesus final hopeful warning occuring so late in the day between bowl 6 & 7Kev, If God says all the vials “are filled with the wrath of God” and Paul says the rapture is at the “last trumpet”, why do you choose to  conclude something quite different?Curt..I’ve gone to great lengths in recent times to demonstrate from scripture that both the trumpets and bowls are ALL God’s wrath (the difference is that the trumpets are enacted by satanic agents/angels at God’s permission whereas the bowls are His DIRECT hand). The bowls are the filling UP (COMPLETION) of His wrath. The bit about the 7th trumpet…there’s no contradiction as all 7 bowls fall under the banner of the 7th trumpet so a rapture pre bowl 7 still works.The appearing, the rapture and the 1st resurrection are all going to happen at the 7th trumpet. The Seal and Trumpet judgments are all the wrath of satan on the Christians, but the last 7 are the wrath of GOD and they are only for the unrepentant sinners. It’s a pre-wrath rapture.Kev, you may have written about all of this but what you say here is unconvincing. The “ANGEL” not satan or demons, come out of the “Temple” and blow their trumpets at God’s direction. These are God’s plagues on mankind and these plagues are then followed by God’s wrath on the unrighteous.Curt there’s no inconsistency….God’s angels blow the trumpets  – often done in the OT to warn of an approaching ENEMY – but if you look INTENTLY at the characteristics of the ‘ENACTERS’ of the trumpet judgments (ie NOT the trumpet blowers) – you’ll hopefully notice they bear the characteristics of ‘fallen’ angels. You’ll notice also before the trumpets are delivered that the enacters are instructed not to harm those with the seal. The enacters of the BOWL judgments are God’s angels – the essence is that God is in control of both the  trumpets and bowlsAs for me, I am agreeing here. GOD says all the BOWL/VIAL judgments are filled with the “wrath of GOD”, and that’s right. Then Paul says the rapture is at the “last trumpet”, so those are both scriptural. If that comment was for me, then it shouldn’t have been, b/c I didn’t conclude anything different.
The wrath of GOD starts at the last set of 7 judgments. JESUS appears, opens the graves and calls up (raptures) the saints at the 7th TRUMPET. We’re here on earth until that. Rev. 11:15-19 tells us that at the 7th trumpet JESUS will appear and take possession of this world away from satan, right then.Not a 7th bowl…I said the bowl judgments starting with the 1st one.
JESUS will appear for the church which is the rapture and the 1st resurrection of the saints at the last trumpet (*the 7th one).
The “wrath of GOD” starts right after that with the 1st bowl/vial judgment and will continue til the last one (the 7th bowl). They are only for the unrepentant sinners, NOT for the church. Some confusion there somewhere…A misunderstanding it seems.I never once said the trumpets and bowls are for believers. They are around but PROTECTED by their seal upto the 5th bowl.If God was able to preserve the Israelites in Egypt through all the plagues is it unreasonable to consider those events a foreshadow of what is to come (with Pharoah a ‘type’ of the final antichrist)Kev: your post ofNov. 24th, 2015 is the accurate truth. Accept you seem reluctant and not sure sometimes. You have inspiring words; however, your missing a few pieces to your puzzle not undermining you I say this with all due respect. If you and I spoke you would be rather intrigued. I have the pieces you’ve been looking for. God BlessI’m with you…Nothing else adds up. Nothing else has a solid foundation. When did you discover this measure of TRUTH? Most Christians think it’s pre-trib and they’re gonna be out of here before the Mark and before the antichrist comes on the scene. What a great falling away it will be when they find out they’re still here. They will pour out of their churches like bees gathering to a nest.Too true wandakate ..it is a MEASURE of truth since you both at least don’t believe ‘pre 7′ or mid 7’ however the complete truth is pre BOWL 7.YES, JESUS comes to take the church just prior to the 1st Bowl judgment, or at the 7th trumpet judgment. We will be out of here before the wrath of GOD, b/c the church is NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD. However, we will know who the antichrist is and we will also realize what the mark of the beast will be.if anyone really wants to know when Christ will come back for his bride they need only to read 2 thessalonians  chapter 2–Paul talks about the man of sin being revealed–it says he who letteth will let–for me this speaks of the Holy Spirit who live with in every one of God’s children—the man of sin will be revealed when the Holy Spirit is taken out of this world–seeing the Holy Spirit live in believers we will have to be gone before Satan or the Beast can start ruling the world—also those who didn’t believe when they could have ( those that have heard the word ) will be given a strong delusion that they will believe the lie that Satan tell them when the rest of us have disappeared–that is what God’s word statesNo, the restrainer that you’re speaking of is actually Michael the Archangel. He is the guardian of GOD’s church and when GOD tells Michael to step aside, then he will do that, and will not be restraining any longer.
It’s not the Holy Spirit or the church, it’s Michael (GOD’s special guardian). The church will be here through all of the Seal and Trumpet judgments, as JESUS said we must persevere until the end. He told us if they persecuted me, they will persecute you. He said we would be blessed when we are persecuted for His sake. We will be reviled, persecuted and said all manner of evil against falsely. But, we’re told to rejoice and be glad, b/c they persecuted the prophets which lived before us. Matt. 5:1-12.
Nobody’s going anywhere until the last trumpet, Rev. 11:15-19. JESUS comes then to takes over from satan and the graves open up and it all happens at that time. There is NO escape route before the antichrist or the mark.Attention. God here.
You all got it wrong..You were supposed to remain Jews and keep the laws of Moses…Sorry.
Going to have to smite all of you now…Really SorryWhat are you saying? You can’t speak for GOD. We weren’t all Jews, and the laws we were supposed to be keeping are the Moral Laws of GOD which are His own 10 Commandments that He wrote with His own finger on 2 tablets of stone. They are in the Ark of the Covenant now, and will be seen when JESUS takes possession of this evil world away from satan at the last trumpet (the 7th one), that’s the rapture, and the 1st resurrection of the deal. Rev. 11:15-19.Albert: YES…it’s pre-wrath meaning it will happen at the 7th trumpet, just prior to the “wrath of GOD”, and that is the bowl/vial judgments. Satan’s wrath is all of the Seal and Trumpet judgments and then JESUS will appear. This is the rapture, the 1st resurrection of the dead all wrapped up at the same time. JESUS comes in the clouds with the Angels, but He doesn’t touch the ground. They are ALL called “UP”, they’re not coming down from heaven, they were dead in their graves and are going to rise. The ones alive will meet them and the angels and JESUS in the air, and go to be with the LORD at that time. So, you are correct, a pre-wrath rapture of the church. I hope End Time agrees with this…Wandakate, Curt and all diehard ‘pre vialers’: Could one of you please finally answer the question I’ve posed a few times:-I know you believe that the rapture and first resurrection occur immediately back to back. If as you say this FIRST resurrection (last chance saloon – REV 20:6 – ‘Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power’ ) – no such promise to anyone who misses this boat – occurs just before the 1st bowl then who exactly is Jesus giving hope to between bowl 6 and 7 ??? A genuine question deserving of a genuine answer (any answer at all would be nice :)):-12 The SIXTH angel poured out his BOWL on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. 13 Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.15 “Look, I come like a thief! BLESSED is the one who STAYS AWAKE and remains clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.”16 Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.17 The SEVENTH angel poured out his BOWL into the airapologies…the alternate meaning for ‘last chance saloon’ doesn’t apply here 🙂1. a place frequented by unsavoury or contemptible people
2. a situation considered to be the last opportunity for successGood question so I have a good answer. Revelation is written in 92 AD. Everything is future here and to be read by believers for 2,000 years. Jesus knows this and has John add theses words so that those of us reading (and saying “I don;t want to be part of this” are reminded to keep our garments clean and in particular during the tribulation don’t soil ourselves with the mark of the beast or you will suffer this wrath. To suggest that this is an admonishment that is meant only for those during the vials is to miss the entire reason for the book. This is an interjected reminder.But if as you say the FIRST resurrection (no more salvation past this point) is pre bowl 1 then why this later warning after bowl 6 ?- no one could benefit from such a warning/promise at this later date so it would be a pointless to give – Jesus doesn’t say things for no good reason. There are two pointers to this (chronologically between bowl 6 & 7) being the rapture-resurrection…one ‘Behold I come as a THIEF’ which is how Jesus comes at rapture. Also bowl 6 is the gathering of the worlds armies – this equates to the gathering of the tares in the parable of the tares. We know from that parable that the gathering of the wheat (aka the rapture-resurrection) occur in the same timeframe. Not to mention we see at bowls 4 & 5 that God is still looking for repentance but after the rapture repentance is no longer possible (ten virgins parable/ Noahs ark). It’s far and away safer to take it it will occur later in the day than to assume it’ll happen sooner and turn away in disappointment when He doesn’t show up when we expect….there I’ve laid it all out for you as requested….I guess I didn’t explain my answer well. The readers of this admonition are all those who read Rev. from 92 AD until now. The fact that it is inserted into a description of something that happens after the resurrection of the righteous is not an indication of the timing of the admonition but knowing that the reader is reading this before it happens it is a reminder that they don’t want to miss the resurrection. Hope this is better.YES, I totally agree, it was written for the future generation that was alive at the end of time (now)…We are to keep ourselves pure as possible, trusting the LORD, as well as obeying Him. Trusting and obeying are very important, and NOT talking the mark of the beast, which we will be offered b/c we are still here until the last trumpet (the 7th one)…Rev. 11: 15-19. JESUS said, we must persevere until the end. So, there is no pre-tribulation rapture. It all happens at the last trumpet which is the same as His appearing and the rapture (the catching away of the saints).It’s not just meant as an admonishment to believers still around during the vials its also meant for us in our time  to know it as an admonishment for those during the vials so we all wouldn’t be in the dark about the timing of the rapture and so be deceived in advance of that time.This ministry is quite wrong when they say that the timing of the Rapture this is not a salvation issue.  Rev 22:19 seems to say that “…if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.”  Rev 22:18 says “I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.”  I interpret the latter to mean that we could forfeit our participation in the Rapture if we add to the prophecies.Therefore, brothers and sisters, I urge you to go direct to the words of Christ on the end of the age of gentiles (Luke 21:24) when you form an opinion in this matter.  Start with Matt 24-25, Mark 13, and Luke 21, which all contain Jesus’ same teaching on the end of the age of the gentiles.  Use the unique sign of the black sun and red moon to combine them with Rev 6:12 – 7:1.  Then locate the Rapture in Rev 7:9-17 and Matt 24:31.  These verses combine perfectly.  All other verses from Paul also fit perfectly into this architecture directly from Jesus.  The wrath of God starts with the first trumpet judgment (Rev 6:12-17) and ends with the last bowl judgment (Rev 15:1).  Bud the church is not destined for the wrath of god (1 Thess 1:10).  So Paul’s mention of the “last trump” (1 Cor 15:52) cannot be the same as the last trumpet judgment (Rev 11:15), it must be the last trump for the gentiles, not the last trumpet judgment.  That is, the age of the gentiles will end with the Rapture of the believing dead and the living believers, which is His church.  Not only is this Scriptural, but it makes perfect sense.If you do this, you should come up with the same conclusion that I did.  The preparatory marking of the 122,000 faithful Jews and the Rapture of the church in Revelation 7 both take place immediately before the wrath begins at the first trumpet judgment in Rev 8:1.  God bless.Dave look up the words “Tribulation ” and “wrath” in a Greek concordance. You will find that the word tribulation means time of trouble and wrath means punishment. Tribulation does not = wrath, this is your assumption. The book itself says the plagues of the vials are the only ones “filled up with the wrath of God”. You cannot make your opinion be fact. The last trumpet in the bible is the 7th trumpet of Revelation. You can try to make separate trumpets to suit your own theology but God wrote the bible and Jesus said He comes at the sound of a trumpet, Paul says the rapture occurs at the sound of a trumpet and then the last trumpet, God assigns 7 angels to blow 7 trumpets and John says the “Mystery” of God is finished at the sounding of the 7th trumpet. What part of God’s trumpets are unclear? Why do you feel you must explain what God meant rather than accepting what He said? How do you explain all the tribulation saints? Saints = believers = Church.  Clearly Revelation shows us believers who are martyred during the tribulation so how do you explain these? How can all the dead in Christ rise first as long as there is one believer alive that will be martyred after that resurrection?
I answered all your points so I expect you to answer mine.
ThanksCurt, You are not arguing with me, but the Scriptures.  I agree with the notion that tribulation (John 16:33) is not the same as wrath (1 Thess 1:10).  Rev 6:16-17 identifies when the wrath becomes imminent, and Rev 16 ends it. The church must be out before the wrath starts with the first trumpet judgment in Rev 8:1.  It goes out in Rev 7:9-17 and Matt 25:31, if you care to see it.  This is the Truth, brother.  All else is verse wrangling to attempt to prove a heresy.God inspired the Bible…He didn’t write it.  40 authors over 1500 years wrote it.Aaron, did the prophets make up what they said and wrote or did God provide the words? The number of authors is irrelevant. Bible is either Gods word and truth or it is worthless. Inspired is another way of saying “maybe or maybe not”. I’m all in.That’s being pedantic. It’s all the more awesome that He would be willing to let his truth be conveyed through the personalities of imperfect men such as you and I…Dave:-1. The warning was specifically about adding or taking away from the TEXT of the prophecy of revelation – nothing to do with INTERPRETING it. Due to it’s nature I think God expected widely differing interpretations – oh BTW you just subtracted from the book (there are 144,000 jews not 122,000  🙂  – lol) 2. As I’ve said before the great multitude is NOT the rapture:-9 After this I looked, and there before me was a GREAT MULTITUDE that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, STANDING BEFORE THE THRONE and before the Lamb(This is in heaven NOT the clouds as in the case of the rapture)Also…‘These are they who have come out of the great tribulation’ This multitude is a specific group (NOT all of God’s faithful people) – it’s limited to those who successfully gone THROUGH the tribulation (aka persecution) , been martyred, stayed faithful to the end and not denied their faith – this is the FULL NUMBER of martyrs alluded to at seal 5 being reachedYou do agree with me on the plain and simple fact that the trumpets and bowls ALL God’s wrathr (Curt and wandakate – please read Rev for yourselves on this matter) – they just have different enacting agents and therefore coverage – satan (permitted – the trumpets) only has 1/3 authority due to only having 1/3 angels. The rapture in Rev is depicted in ch 14:
14 I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man[b] with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, ‘Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.’ 16 So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.The harvest of the wicked is mentioned back to back:17 Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. 18 Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, ‘Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.’ 19 The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath. 20 They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.TEXTUALLY both are placed between the 7th trumpet and the start of the seven bowls however it’s really just like hovering a magnifying glass over Rev 16:15 which occurs just before bowl 7:-15 ‘Look, I COME LIKE A THIEF! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.’16 THEN they GATHERED the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.…also the express reason I habitually cut and paste whole excerpts from Revelation is to avoid the risk of adding or subtracting from the text…..:)Dave,
PreTribbers assume that the Church must be removed from the earth in order for God to pour out His wrath.  Paul says in Romans that God’s wrath is already being revealed…and we are still here.  The Trumpets are poured out on 1/3 of the earth and ONLY those without the Seal of God…which scripture tells is the Holy Spirit.
The Trumpets are blown by angels.  The Last Trump is blown by God.
“For the Lord Himself will descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the TRUMP OF GOD…” I Thess 4:16
When does this happen? Read the following passages.
“The Lord also shall ROAR out of Zion, and UTTER His VOICE from Jerusalem, and the heavens and earth shall shake, but the Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.” Joel 3:16
“I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for My people and for My heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted My land…
“Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the heathen round about.”
(The above is the sheep/goat judgment).
“Put in the SICKLE, for the HARVEST IS RIPE; come get you down, for the PRESS IS FULL, the VATS OVERFLOW, for their wickedness is great.
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision, for the DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR in the valley of decision…
(Notice the Day of the Lord has not yet begun; it is near)
“The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining…
“The Lord shall ROAR out of Zion…  (Joel)
“And I saw another mighty Angel come down from Heaven with a CLOUD, and a rainbow was upon His head, and His face was as it were the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire.  And He had in His hand a little book;
…and He set His right foot upon the sea, and His left foot on the earth,
And He cried with a LOUD VOICE (a shout), as when a Lion ROARS; and when He had cried, seven thunders UTTERED their voices…
But in the days of the VOICE of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God (Ephesians …Jew and Gentile, and all things and heaven and earth, made ONE in Christ) shall be finished, as He has declared to His servants the prophets… Rev 10
“And I looked and behold, a white CLOUD, and upon the cloud sat one like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp SICKLE.
“And another angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loud voice to Him that sat on the cloud, ‘Thrust in Thy SICKLE, and reap, for the time is come for Thee to reap, for THE HARVEST OF THE EARTH IS RIPE.
“And He that sat on the cloud thrust in His SICKLE on the earth and the earth was reaped.
(Jesus the Son of Man gathers His own, but leaves the rest for the angels to gather…)
“And another angel came out of the Temple which is in Heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
“And another angel came out from the Altar, which had power over fire, and cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp SICKLE, saying, ‘Thrust in thy sharp SICKLE, and gather the clusters of the VINE of the earth, for her grapes are fully RIPE.  And the angel thrust in his SICKLE into the earth, and gathered the VINE of the earth, and cast it into the great WINEPRESS of the with of God, and the WINEPRESS WAS trodden (and the VATS are full to overflowing)…
Now Notice the TRUMP OF GOD…
“And the Lord shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth as LIGHTNING (Read Matthew 24:27) and the Lord God shall BLOW THE TRUMPET, and shall go forth with the whirlwinds of the south…And the Lord their God shall save them in that Day (the Day of the Lord…ONE DAY) as the flock of His people, for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon His land.”  Zechariah 9
In other words, God’s people are raptured after the tribulation of those days (the Trumpets represent the end of the age, the Three Woes are the time of great tribulation).  God blows the trumpet (the great trumpet) THEN He pours out the Bowls of wrath upon Babylon, as He rescues His Bride…just as Rahab was rescued on the day the walls of Jericho fell, and as Lot fled out of Sodom.
The Church Age ends when the fulness of the Gentiles comes in (is grafted into the chosen remnant of Israel).  When does this happen?
“…when the Redeemer comes out of Zion…”
The rapture/resurrection happens after the time of tribulation, but before God’s wrath.
The Great Multitude is not the rapture.  It is an interlude, where John is answering the question, “The Day of their wrath has come, and who can STAND?  Then John hears  144,000 are sealed, and then sees a great multitude STANDING before the Lamb.
There are several resurrections in the book of Revelation.  They are all the same resurrection, described from differing points of view.I’m new to this site, I’ve read all the post’s thru August. I’m almost 59 yrs young & was baptized in March of 2014. Someone I worked with gave me her Left Behind book series & it truly put the fear of God in me, I grew up with some church in my life but hated everything about it , I didn’t understand anything. Over my adult life I tried to read the bible at different times and it was like trying to read a different language. Now, coming back to now, I started going on-line checking out bible study site’s and found one that was perfect, I could actually understand & when I read the bible I could understand it, it was so cool to be able to do that and I believe that it was the Holy Spirit helping me because I had finally accepted Our Christ Jesus and believed what I was learning. The part’s about early church visits as a kid I remember was always a rupture, the church I was going to did not believe this, I was given a book to read on it & it made sense, now over this last year I realized that I wasn’t learning anything, I was learning more on my own and no one was ever wanting to talk about Jesus or the bible when we had our fellowship. I became so hungry for more information that I decided to check out different types of churches, I talked & studied with JW because I realized that I had no idea what they believed I had always hid from them when they came around, they are very devoted to Christ but seem to be so focused on his name and following their script that I knew that wasn’t for me (they also don’t believe in) a rapture. I talked with my neighbor and friend about the catholic church, I didn’t know anything about that either & found out that that isn’t for me. For the last year I’ve been studying from the pastors on TV, through DVD’s I’ve bought at the christian bookstore, I’ve found this new channel thru dish that’s called “Shepherds Chapel” this is the first time I’ve studied with a pastor that for the first 30 minutes he reads from a different book each airing verse by verse & explains it to you, the next 30 minutes he reads questions sent in & answers best as he can. Here’s the reason I’m sharing this with all of you, after reading everything that all of you have written it seems that you’re all studying from different Bibles, going to different churches and aren’t coming to the same truth, I don’t think our Father and Saviour wants us to be this confused. I need help understanding alot of the bible but everywhere I turn to believes different, teaches different & every one of them say’s their right. After reading all your post’s & if I hadn’t been studying so hard on my own and relying on the Holy Spirit to guide me I’d be so confused I wouldn’t know where to turn, you all love our Lord and want to be with Him when it’s time to go home, please, read your bible and before ask God to help you understand everything you’re reading, no matter who’s right or wrong at this point we all want to be with Him unfortunately most of us have relied on our pastors to guide us, they’re just people too & sometimes they’re not always right either. I am so excited about knowing all of this is true that I can’t get enough but I am going to go by what I can learn by reading the bible, studying and let it come to me from within. Good luck on your studies and I look forward to meeting you in heaven, God bless you. I do like learning from End Times airings, I believe in the things he’s teaching & I believe he knows what he’s talking aboutSuzie you are wise beyond your own belief. You are on the right track. Pray for guidance and understanding from the HS and continue to study. There are some people out there who do want to engage in serious, non confrontational bible study and research but you have to look for them. This site is a good place to post a serious question. If you do consider all the responses thoughtfully, do your own research and then let the Spirit guide you. My best advise is make your theology fit the scriptures not try to make the scripture fit your own theology. Next remember that God is not the author of confusion. There are no conflicts in scripture only in our understanding. If some of your beliefs cause confusion or conflict with scripture then rethink your belief. God will always show you truth. You are so on the right track. Thrust God, His Christ and His HS. Be blessed.Suzie, I give bible studies and would love to communicate with you regarding salvation.  Good loves you so much. If you would like to communicate. God  bless!Suzie, Acts 2:38 is the born again experience needed for salvation. God Bless.It is a wonderful channel!  I watch it all the time. I live just a few miles from them. Sometimes when I cannot sleep I watch the recorded lessons.  I heard that Pastor Arnold had passed away in Feb. I believe….but it still airs his lessons….I enjoy Pastor Dennis also. I have learned more from them in a few short months than from years of regular church! Love them both.Here goes:1. There are only 2 resurrections – one for the righteous and one for the wicked (a thousand years later). If you miss the first you end up in the 2nd – no argument.2. The description of bowls 4 & 5 clearly indicate repentance opportunities (though the hearers are clearly too hardened to make use of them)3. If the rapture-resurrection occurs pre bowl 1 then the bowl 4 & 5 repentance opportunities are ingenuine since the hearers end up in the 2nd resurrection of the wicked anyway. This is aside from the message of warning and hope between bowls 6 & 7 – what would be the point ? – hearers would be destined for the 2nd resurrection anyway4. Bowl 6 is the gathering of the armies (tares) which according to the parable of the tares is in the same timeframe as the gathering of the wheat (rapture resurrection).5. The mention of Jesus coming as a thief and the accompanying promise and warning between bowl 6 & 7 implies rapture-resurrection at this point rather than 7 years earlier.or ANY earlier point for that matter…Kev, comments by the number;1) Agree
2) Disagree. The statement that they repented not is a statement of fact prophesied long before. Had they ever been willing to repent their evil they would have done so during the trumpet plagues. If they really had an opportunity for salvation through repentance then that would conflict with Rev. 10:7 where the mystery of God (the church) is finished at the sounding of the 7th trumpet. There could be no “believers” after this. Also the reigh of the antichrist is 42 months as is the mission of the two witnesses who are part of the first resurrection and are called to heaven at the sounding of the 7th trumpet. Bowls are filled with the wrath of God and we are not appointed to God’s wrath.
3) Disagree per #2 and as I think I posted to you before the “thief” comment is just one more reminder to the reader (not the people of the bowls) that Jesus is coming again. The 2nd resurrection does state “whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake” which implies that some people in the second resurrection may pass the judgement.
4) You can use that analogy but I think Rev. 14:14-20 is a better comparison where Jesus resurrects the righteous and the the angels gather the unrighteous to the winepress which is how Armageddon is described.
5) See #3 but also not 7 years earlier but only a few days (maybe 30) earlier. Rapture to Armageddon a very short time.All in all your logic is not bad but leads to conflicts which need resolution because there cannot be any conflicts. I believe my responses eliminate the conflicts. I generally enjoy your posts.Curt: thought I would drop a line and maybe some.
The 7 trumpets are warnings to the world to make their minds up. At which point those who want to follow God are sealed by Him.
This is made plane that we will go through the time everybody calls the tribulation. Just wondering, what do we call this present time if were waiting for even worse days ahead? So my point is what are the signs we look for?
First, the two witnesses for 3.5 years teach the absolute truth or the original Gospel that was taught, by Jesus and His disciples to begin with; depicted as the first seal or the Rider on the white horse. This Seal was opened by Jesus 2000 AD years ago. So the Gospel truth was first in its purity and righteous form when Jesus taught. Jesus is this first Seal as it should be, and the color white signifies purity, a church without error. But again people take this too out of context bringing it up to our day, saying this is the Antichrist. Not so…Anyways the two witnesses will preach the same Jesus taught 2000 years ago for the first 3.5 years, Of this week.
 But Scripture tells us they will be hated as so many people would rather keep believing the same thing then change as God is calling them to come out of Babylon and all the false teachings to His fold by these two.
After 3.5 years the devil kills them. Then the world is given 3.5 more years to consider what they heard from the two witnesses while they were alive; the world is given a probation hour of 3.5 years more.
 Just like after Jesus ascended, another 3.5 years more were given; the message was still to go to the Jews. After the stoning of Steven, it was the end of the seventh year; that the message was no longer for the Jews. At which point the Gospel was now to go to the gentile’s. What I’m saying is, the 3.5 years thereafter Jesus had ascended; is in our day a type of probational period was for the house of Jacob or Israel; to make right, as they handed over their Messiah to the Romans. So you and I and all will be given a little time more to accept Christ or not. Will your church hand over Jesus to the law or embrace Him and the two prophet’s message?
 Jesus is calling all to one fold today and even gives the world two more prophets to preach true sound doctrine Gospel like that of Jesus time. But like in Jesus time they are handed over to be killed.
When in our time the Gospel go’s to the world for 3.5 years; like in Jesus day probation of 3.5 years like that, that had to go to the house of Israel; will happen again in our time Jesus will still plead for us. Sorry for repeating myself; but I can’t stress it more; this will be repeated in our day for 3.5 years.
 God holds the 7 last plagues back so everybody has a chance to make their minds up for themselves, after 3.5 years those who are sealed by God and those who are sealed with the mark of the beast and his number 666 are forever, “done”. Jesus now is described as High Priest leaving the Temple in Heaven by opening the doors and the Ark of The Covenant that housed the 10 Commandments and is seen by all. Or, so you understand He no longer pleads for sinners and all are made for Heaven or are lost forever. This should speak volumes as to why the Ark of the Covenant is seen. But that in itself is another story.
The 70th week everybody is talking about should remain in its setting, not ripped out of context to support the Antichrist 3.5 years, this is so wrong. The 70th week is the week or 7 literal years given to the house of Israel. And He shall confirm the covenant with many for 7 years in the middle of the week “He” the Messiah Jesus, (not the Antichrist) will be cut off. What this is saying is Jesus will teach the Gospel for 3.5 years, and for another 3.5 years the same message is to go to His people. What Jesus did in the middle of the week was to bring the Sanctuary system service to an end; as throughout the Old Testament was kept. This system the whole time foreshadowed the Lamb of God Jesus, the perfect sacrifice who died in the middle of the week. see Matthew 27: 51 The Vail was ripped in two from top to bottom by a unseen hand and the Vail that separated the Most Holy from the Holy place was brought down precisely when Jesus died on the cross; this was for all to know that God has brought this system implying that the Sanctuary service has now been done away with no longer are we to kill an animal for our sins; Jesus has fulfilled it by His death and nailed it to the cross along with the table of ordinances. However, people like the thought that He also nailed the 10 Commandments and the 7 feast days also. So not true friends  In other words in the middle of the week, He Jesus will bring to an end that very system. Why people teach that this is in our time and are saying this is the Antichrist’s, still amazes me.
Now that does not dispute that there are 7 years in our time, it’s just related to the two witnesses work. Again, however let’s leave the 70th week alone, which should glorify our Savior not the devil, as Jesus paid our debt. However, people still find their reasons to think otherwise.
After the 7 years in our time the world will begin to experience the 7 last plagues both classes go through this time Sealed and unsealed; again people like to think God will take us away well before then, not so. But it does say in many Old Testament books that God will shield His people during this offal time. After the plagues Jesus and all the angels and some of the redeemed that Jesus took with Him as a sample to the Father as to why He came in the place for fallen man will then come, and every eye shall see Him no secret thing about His second coming. It will be audible, visual, physical, emotional, and spiritual. This ushers in the 1st resurrection and them who are alive who are saved at Jesus coming. The evil that died in the past generations remain in their graves and the evil that were alive at His coming are destroyed by the brightness of His coming no man then is alive on the earth to bury them. These will come up in the 2nd resurrection and the 2nd death follows thereafter there is no hope for any who miss the first resurrection.     Remember when Moses was told to take Lambs blood and mark the top and two sides of the door; and that any who is first born shall not die; in other words the blood on the door will protect them from death; God did not remove a soul but made provision for them. In our day this is repeated and like the death angel that moved upon Egypt and the Israelites destroying the first born; this happens during the 7 last plagues. Do you think God cannot protect you? Well He can do just that and more. If the Blood of the Lamb is on the door post of your heart which means you are sealed by the blood of the Lamb; also, that you have accepted Jesus into your heart, Justified by grace not of works of ourselves lest we should boast, but by faith and works and a good measure of God’s grace for fallen man will every man be judged.According to Matt 24:22  And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened. I do believe we are IN the tribulation has the Lord communicated in clarification with you on this verse?Janet…I can give you my understanding of this:-1) According to Daniel 1,260 days (3.5 years) are allotted for persecution of the saints.2) Antichrist proves way too efficient in his extermination of the saints e.g. eyes and ears everywhere (possibly death squads to hand) + saints can’t eat or drink (can’t buy or sell) + people all to ready to betray.3) The bodily rapture promise guarantees some living believers when Jesus returns for His bride4) The sixth seal has to be brought forward (the 1,260 days have to be ‘shortened’ to a smaller time period) so that all believers aren’t killed off.5) When God’s designated number of martyrs (this is the benchmark) is complete the 6th seal is brought in and the ‘7th seal+’ trumpet and bowl judgments proceed.6) The promise in Daniel for 1,260 days persecution still stands HOWEVER antichrists activity is severely hindered and he is severely distracted by the judgments but he still has power to wage war with the saints ’til the 1,260th day. The trumpet judgments are ‘stretched out in time’ so that the terminus remains at the 1,260 day point (last day) when the resurrection-rapture happens.7) The only trumpet judgment which wouldn’t be ‘stretched out’ in this way is the 5 month fixed period judgment.I have a question. Hopefully you will see this and be able to give me an answer. I am a born again Christian and have been since 1987. I have always believed in the Pre-Tribulation Rapture. My question is this: Why would God make the saved, born again Christians suffer through the Tribulation and be killed by the antichrist. We who are truly saved have accepted Jesus into our hearts and believe that His grace and blood is sufficient to save us from our sins and have eternal life through Him. So why would we be subjected to such a bad time and be slaughtered during the antichrist’s role and actions on earth. I know that we are all sinners and deserve to burn in hell, but God loved us enough to give his life for us so that we wouldn’t have to go there. So it seems to me that when God comes back in the clouds to call us home, it would be before things got really bad and desperate here on earth. Just wondering what you thought.jb if you’ve kept up with my posts I would have thought you know what I think by now 🙂 The problem is in the west we are not accustomed with persecution (even ridicule let along physical persecution quite apart froom martyrdom. If you look at the history of the Church and God’s people throughout history you’ll hopefully see that the NORM for God’s people is suffering – of the apostles all were martyred except John (though not for the want of trying ! – a miraculous deliverance for John). Many millions of Christians suffered hideous tortures and martyrdom during the inquisition. Here are some refs to show the normaility of suffering in the Christian experience:-Heb 12
7 Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? 8 If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. 9 Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live! 10 They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. 11 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.Col 1
24 Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.2 Tim 3
12 In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,1 Pe 4
16 Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.[a]Matt 5
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,
    For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 “Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. 12 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.and many many more….I think our cossetted culture forbids us to see this ‘normal’ side of the Christian experienceThe heats going to get turned up in the west so best to get used to the idea sooner or later…..otherwise we’ll end up like……Mark 4
16 Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. 17 But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.The big point is that we as believers are not promised problem from tribulation (Gk: thlipsis – which is really biblically persecution /’pressure’ on God’s people) – the tribulation is not the judgments /wrath of God rather it’s satans wrath (persecution/martyrdom)….we’re never guaranteed deliverance from satans wrath only God’s wrath (the post persecution trumpet and bowl judgments):-John 16
33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world YE (believers) SHALL HAVE TRIBULATION(aka persecution): but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.1 Thess 5
9 For God hath not appointed us to WRATH(meaning His), but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,some ‘prophecy teachers’ have muddied a lot of the waters…..please research all refs to tribulation in the NT – you’ll see it invariably refers to persecution /suffering of God’s people.Please see the attached link to see how those closest to Jesus were spared…http://www.bibleprobe.com/apostles.htmJb Hi, I thought I would leave you a quick note on the above. Yes we will all go through the tribulation. If God would do what you talked about, then he can take us right now do you understand? As long as you do not accept the mark of the beast then you and I will be sheltered from the 7 last plagues. Remember, Moses brought the ten plagues on pharaoh and all Egypt. But no harm came to the Israelite’s. So in our time; the 7 last plagues likewise are a pattern. Again the 7 plagues fall on those who have the mark of the beast only. Then the second coming happens and the 1st Resurrection. And if your engaged to Christ and truly love Him then we all need to come out of Babylon. This means God will call everyone to the true church He wants you to be in and their is only one true church. Remember God cannot force you to come out of false religions it is your choice. The Secret rapture is a deadly lie spun from hell itself. The enemy wants us to accept this teaching ; as therefore the book of Revelation is not relevant for us to understand; but those who are left. Not So…Search and educate yourself on how to get victory over the mark of the beast. The storm is coming so prepare beloved. I’m here if you need help. God Bless Jb.Rev 20:4 demonstrates what ‘victory over the mark’ translates to:-4 I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They[a] had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands.Hey jb, just read what you posted in Jan. and if I may say. It would seem to be logical to assume God will take us out before that time. If you can recall the life of Moses the prophet, God instructed him, when the 10th plague was about to fall on Egypt; to take a Lamb and the blood to be marked on three places on their doors. One at the top and two on each side of the doors. What I’m saying is in our day the book of Revelation mentions the world condition as Sodom and Egypt. Why? like in Moses day God did not remove His people from the cry’s and screams of the 10th plague. So I’m saying that if we mark our hearts with the blood of Jesus on the door of our hearts, we will be protected by His angels. God knows His people. So yes we will go through the tribulation of our day. And Revelation has 7 plagues as in Moses day had 10. Do you see the parallelism? There is no such thing as a secret taking of God’s people to Heaven. The message to Moses and our day fittingly describe all of us at one time go to heaven, also called the “Marriage Supper of the Lamb” When Jesus comes for His Bride He is our Groom. Like the parable of the ten virgins Jesus talked about the 5 that were ready at His second coming would enter the Marriage. Noah’s day should make sense that when they entered into the Ark God sealed them in and the rain and waters came and took them on the outside away. 8 were saved. Would it make sense their will be two marriage weddings for the first class then the second? Knowing that God is not a respecter of persons!! When we get baptized initially we are engaged to Jesus our Groom. Then when the second coming of Jesus happens it is the marriage part or the party that takes place. And what do you suppose comes next? Well the honey moon. Properly understood this time is a 1000 years our Groom, “Jesus” takes all the saved through a Universal galactic time for us as Jesus in respect of knowledge reveille’s the mystery’s of all the questions we could not as a people understand while on earth. So like when two get married only at death will they part. Also Moses as a prophet was a type of Christ ex. Moses went up the mountain to receive God’s Law. After Jesus was baptized by John, He went into the wilderness for how long? 40 days and 40 nights, Moses was also 40 days and 40 nights, when he was given the Law of God. Noah was in the Ark 40 days and 40 nights. Jesus is the same yesterday today and tomorrow. I’m saying look at the patterns throughout the Bible God is telling us what will take place by what has happened in the past. I’m not trying to force a belief but that you form your opinions on the Word of God not by reading a verse and build your argument on that. God will give you as much as you ask so how far do you want the rabbit hole to go? Again that depends on you. There are many levels within Scripture Jesus will give you, some are happy with surface gold, while others its lower down. As Jesus said “be it according to your faith” You need to decide how far you will go and this is for all of us. God BlessNot sure my last attempt at responding to this made it through but here goes again in case it didn’t:-1) The persecution and martyrdom begins at the midpoint of the ‘week’ (the designated period of persecution in Daniel is 3.5 years)2) At the 5th seal the saints cry out for justice for their martyrdom3) The 6th seal has to BROUGHT FORWARD (the ‘days shortened’ – ie the designated 1,260 days) because antichrist is killing off God’s people at an alarming rate (not difficult to imagine with eyes and ears everywhere through technology + at hand ‘death squads’ – not to mention starvation, thirst and exposure to the elements due to not being able to buy food / drink or live in a home) – otherwise there’d be no one left to ‘bodily’ rapture.
4) The 6th seal heavenly signs are the warnings of God’s impending judgment (trumpets then bowls) – these (not Jesus appearing) are what make the wicked fearful of coming judgment (7th seal +). The completed quota of martyrs (great multitude) appears in heaven around this time. 5)  The trumpets and bowls begin and continue in sequence (bowls after trumpets). The beast knows that Jesus is due to appear on the 1,260th day so the 6th bowl gathering of the armies is scheduled to complete at the last (1,260th) day – the beast has come to make war with Jesus and knows from prophecy exactly when He’s due to appear (though the devil likes to throw us into confusion about that date !).  These judgments will likely have the effect of severely distracting and hindering the beast from continuing to martyr the remaining saints – though he still has ‘authority’ potentially to do that ‘til the 1,260th day. In practise he can’t carry it out. During this time I believe the remnant of living saints will experience supernatural provision and protection from His judgments (along with the 144,000 sealed Jews).6) The resurrection-rapture then occur on that ‘last day’ as foretold in a number of places in scripture. I believe the 7th bowl is then poured out on that same (last) day.
7) Armageddon follows (the saints are now with Jesus in the clouds and are ready to descend with him to defeat the beast’s vast army).There are only a couple of questions in my mind but I believe are resolvable (at least in part).
1)	The announcement at the 7th trumpet that the kingdom of the world now belongs to Jesus but that the beast is supposed to have authority for 3.5 years. That would have to mean that the 7th trumpet was also blasted on the last day which in turn would mean that the bowls all be delivered in a SINGLE 24 hour DAY – BUT can the world’s armies (bowl 6) really gather in a single day ? Answers on a postcard.
2)	‘No man knoweth the day or the hour’. What I’ve presented above appears to suggest that Jesus return date is knowable. I think the key to this is that until the start of the final ‘week’ no man knoweth the day or the hour but AS SOON AS THAT 7th WEEK COMMENCES the countdown will begin.sorry not ‘7th week’ but rather ’70th and final’ week.I realise I’ve not accounted for the extra 75 days in Daniel. Perhaps the bowls and Armageddon are deilvered over this 75 day time period with the ‘last day’ (rapture day ?) actually being the 1,335th day.I suspect drones will come into the picture too….Janet, unless the antichrist has been revealed and is leader of a world Gov’t then we are not in the Great Tribulation. Also know that God foresaw all things that would happen in this creation from before it was created. He has already made sure that the days of tribulation will not be too long hence they have already been “shortened”. What is written is what will happen and the saints will be saved.Do you believe the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ will start the 1000 year reign on earth? And when the bible talks about the saints being caught up to meet the Lord in the air, why would the saints go up and then come right back down? Will the marriage supper of the lamb be in heaven or on earth? ThanksTroy, my answers in order of your questions.1) Yes
2) Saints are caught up to meet Jesus in the air at the rapture, they go to heaven and return with Christ some time later after the marriage supper in Heaven and the outpouring of the bowls of wrath on earth.
3) As in #2 in heaven where all the righteous have been resurrected and are all present with the Lord.Curt…not sure whether the supper occurs immediately after the wedding but Rev 19 would suggest that the wedding itself happens soon after the destruction of Babylon but before Armageddon.Rev 19
7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb IS COME, and his wife hath made herself ready.This to me suggests the wedding takes place on the clouds after the
resurrection-rapture has taken place (the saints and Jesus watching on at Babylons downfall from the clouds before resuming descent for Armageddon)Also when Jesus comes back He won’t changing direction:-Acts 1
11 “Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the SAME WAY you have seen him go into heaven.”also who says we and He have to go back to heaven in order to be FOREVER WITH HIM
we simply have to BE WITH HIM (wherever that may be)1 Thessalonians 417 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and SO SHALL WE EVER BE WITH THE LORD.My understanding is that the millenium will begin 75 days after the 2nd coming / resurrection-rapture (which itself is 1,260 days after the midpoint of Danield 70th ‘week’) but I don’t pretend to understand exactly what goes on in that final 75 day period……cleanup – there’ll be devastation everywhere (30 days ?) followed  consecration of the temple (45 days?) is a possibility (don’t know for sure). I can’t see it says anywhere for sure exactly when or where the marriage supper will take place but I would guess that Jesus would want His wedding to take place as soon as possible after the start of the millenial reign on earth.Going up then down ?
1) Apparently it was a custom for the victor to be met and welcomed in – not sure about this one though as Armaggedon victory yet to happen by this point so not yet technically victors (???)2) The 7th bowl devastation is too severe (earthquakes and extremely heavy hailstones) for us to stick around and we need to be raptured out before hand into the clouds. Then we come down again to share in the battle of Armaggedon with Jesus (though this is very heavily weighted in the saints favour).Mat 24:29
​ Mat 24:22
And G2532 except G1508 those G1565 days G2250 should be shortened, G2856 there G3756 should G302 no G3956 flesh G4561be saved: G4982 but G1161 for G1223 the elect’s sake G1588those G1565 days G2250 shall be shortened. G2856
these are Jesus words, Matthew
 24: 29 these words of Jesus are describing the 7th seal of Rev 8
¶
Immediately G1161 G2112 after G3326 the tribulation G2347 of those G1565 days G2250 shall the sun G2246 be darkened, G4654and G2532 the moon G4582 shall G1325 G0 not G3756 give G1325her G846 light, G5338 and G2532 the stars G792 shall fall G4098from G575 heaven, G3772 and G2532 the powers G1411 of the heavens G3772 shall be shaken: G4531
the word AFTER G3326 means (with, after, behind) notice the definition “with” comes first before “after”….
In Rev 6:1-12 describes the opening of seals 1-6 in V.12-14 the sixth seal of the great earthquakes and stars falling from the heavens (we are already being warned of meteors/stars coming near to earth with possible impacts) v.15-16 all men asking to be hidden from this wrath of the Lamb…. then  Rev 6:17 says for the great day of his wrath is come
Rev 6:17
For G3754 the great G3173 day G2250 of his G846 wrath G3709 is come; G2064 and G2532 who G5101 shall be able G1410 to stand? G2476
then next you see in Rev 7:1-7 John describing the tribes of israel and the GREAT multitude standing before the throne and the Lamb next in Rev 8 the seventh seal opened and the wrath of God being poured out
which would then mean Rev 7 is definitely talking about God calling us home
 and out of the wrathnext look at Rev 8 where the 7th seal and Gods wrath poured outI do believe this could be our catching away!  We are from what I can tell about to see the 6th seal to be opened…we are very close​If you see my other posts on the subject of the ‘great multitude’ it will hopefully be immediately evident (based on 2 key indicators) that this is the completed quota of tribulation MARTYRS i.e. the ‘full number’ mentioned at the 5th seal. Rapture comes sometime later (after the 7th seal trumpet and bowl judgments though is back to back with the resurrection and immediately follows that) and is reserved for those still alive in the body having survived the mass martyrdom.THE RAPTURE WILL SOON TAKE PLACE-FOR THE 5 VIRGINS HIS BRIDE WITH OIL IN THE LAMP A MOMENT BEFORE THE GREAT TRIBULATION STARTS. MAYBE THIS JEAR 2016 BELIFE AND BE READY-HE COMES LIKE A THIFE IN THE NIGHT……1KOR 15,57You probably and other’s don’t know this,but in the book of Revelation the Lord did give to disciple John to know the hour of His coming, back in Matthew 24:36 when the Lord spoke those words, that no one knows the day or hour this was way before the book of Revelation was even written,the Lord revealed many things to disciple John to write in the book of Revelation.many people will say,the Lord is coming just before the tribulation,then others will say in the middle of the tribulation, then other’s say just after the tribulation,does anyone bother to ask the Lord when He is coming, Notice what Christ Jesus the Lord said about when He is coming in Matthew 24:29-30, verse 29 – “Immediately after the tribulation,So Christ Jesus the Lord said he’s coming immediately after the tribulation, not before,not in the middle,not some time after the tribulation,but immediately after the tribulation.then in verse 30 ” And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man. I wonder just how many people will not like what the Lord has said about when He is coming.knowing the day or hour of His coming as not the same as knowing when He will come RELATIVE to the tribulation…..there’s nothing anywhere to suggest that anyone other than God the Father knows the day or hour of His coming.It’s not the “day or hour”, it’s the signs of the times and the fact that He did say, “immediately after”.
The tribulation is the seal and trumpet judgment. The great tribulation is the bowl judgments thus the wrath of GOD, therefore if he’s coming right after the tribulation of those days then it’s at the 7th trumpet before the wrath of GOD (the last 7 which are bowl judgments). See Revelation 11:15-19. This is the 7th trumpet, it’s the appearing, the rapture and the resurrection all wrapped up into one big cataclysmic event.Many Christians think the rapture is before the tribulation so, most are not  prepared for what is coming. I always tell them that God has to shorten the time for the Elect’s sake and he sends his two witnesses who the antichrist kills after three and a half years and you think he is going to rapture you before the tribulation,I don’t think so! Malachi 4:5 tells us that Elijah is one of the witnesses and I believe that Enoch is the other. Those are the only two that haven’t died yet and it is appointed unto man once to die. Three and a half days after their death they are resurrected, then we will know that the seventh trumpet is near.The antichrist  is going to know the scripture and will take all property and accounts from those that won’t deny Jesus Christ and take the mark of the beast. We will need to network with other Christians to survive and endure to the end. I’m prepared and unafraid resting in the power of the Holy Ghost and fire, willing and able to help my brothers and sisters!Good post Wayne. We must network together. I am in TN and John has my email so if you are near and wish to make contact please do.I was living in Pigeon Forge in 2011 also in Sevierville as well. Spent about 14 months in that beautiful area right at the foothills of the Smoky Mts.
Where in Tennessee are you, on the west side or the east side or in the middle?I live in Montgomery, Al., hoping to have my family that lives here (my two daughters and their families) and certain Church members that we can go thru this time together.  Heaven is worth more than the effort.By the way I have asked before, what is everyone’s thoughts on the mark of the Beast, what is it exactly.  Is it just one thing or the make up of several things.  Your opinions PLEASE.Greg, that is my understanding also.  The main point Christains must be ready at all, any times, no matter who is correct about different arguments, my key to all of this is BeReady.  I am looking so forward to what ever GOD sends our way.  I will state that I enjoy eating and then drinking good COLD water, but if I have to starve to be a member of Heaven’s elect then so be it.
We need to love one another, for so many things are happening so fast thru my eyes I just keep saying, Since God’s in charge and created everything that we can think about or things that we can’t comprehend, my trust is GOD is 100%.  Try to refrain from calling Lrving or anyone else names, all we are trying to do is find out the truth, that 100% I was speaking about earlier.  Only GOD has all the answers, remember that and just always be ready.  Yes that very difficult during these times, we ain’t seen nothing Yet.That’s encouraging, I will need help, so if I know what state your in I’ll come and be your neighbor.
I’m prying the LORD will have me some help at that time, and those alone won’t make it.
It’s going to be a group endeavor. I think power will be in numbers. Bless you for being ready, willing and able. The LORD looks for those who won’t shy away from their responsibilities of obedience to Him.Scripture tells us that Elijah was “translated’.. taken up, yes. But scripture also tells us years later that letters were sent by Elijah. God translated him…God moved him, because people wanted him dead. He saw a natural death years later. Enough on the other hand did not see death. Bbecause all old testament scriptures are for- shadows of something better to come. I believe Enoch’s death is symbolic, yet literal at the same time. In other words.. “was not”.. is a representation of a future rapture of them who will be not resurrected but TRANSFORMED.Ever get the feeling you’re hitting your head against a brick wall ? 🙁OK …forget Daniels extra 75 days for now…I’ve reconciled the conundrum of the 6th bowl duration:-The account of Joshua and Rev 10 convinces me that the 7th trumpet will be a LONG blast lasting an unknown number of days.The 7th trumpet therefore begins to sound SOME DAYS BEFORE the 1,260th day. The bowls take place WHILE THAT TRUMPET IS BLOWING .The 1,260th (‘LAST’) day I believe will have the following events:-1) The 7th trumpet STOPS sounding (after sounding for days).
2) The kingdoms of the world (this agrees with the prophecy that antichrist will have power for 1,260 days) become the kingdom of God and Christ
3) The resurrection-rapture occurs on this ‘LAST’ day as foretold in a number of places as scheduled
4) The two witnesses are resurrected and ascend (as part of the overall resurrection-rapture) to Jesus
and then the earthquake in the city (Jerusalem) takes place as part  of the 7th bowl worldwide earthquake where the cities of the nations collapse.
5) I believe this collapse has a ‘type’ in the collapse of the walls of Jericho which collapse at the 7th and final trumpet blast.
6) Armageddon follows which corresponds to the army plundering JerichoI seem to recall that the 2 witnesses lie in Jerusalem for 3.5 days before being resurrected and since they prophesied for 1,260 days then they must have started prophesying to Jerusalem 3.5 days before the midpoint of the ‘7’ – enough time to warn the Jews to heed Jesus warning to flee before the ‘trampling of the Gentiles’ …oh the perfect unity of the Bible 🙂Here are the refs:-Josh 6:5 When you hear them sound a LONG blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.”Rev 10:7 But in the DAYS OF THE VOICE OF the SEVENTH angel, when he shall BEGIN to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.This timing might also suggest that the two witnesses not only ‘call forth’ / invoke (like Moses and Elijah) the trumpet judgments but also the bowls !!!!!! Oh it’s all fitting together now…..:)see Rev 11 I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers. 2 But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months. 3 And I will appoint my TWO WITNESSES, and they will PROPHESY FOR 1,260 DAYS, clothed in sackcloth.” 4 They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the Lord of the earth.”[a] 5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. 6 They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and THEY HAVE POWER TO TURN THE WATERS INTO BLOOD and to strike the earth WITH EVERY KIND OF PLAGUE AS OFTEN AS THEY WANT.Hang on though….the 2 witnesses appear to be resurrected before the seventh trumpet starts to sound. One explanation for this might be that they complete their 1,260 day prophesying 3.5 days before the start of the sevent trumpet which itself (I suggested) starts sounding some days before the 42 month point after the midpoint . This in all might suggest that the 2 witnesses start their prophesying even earlier than 3.5 days before the midpoint.…which would in turn suggest that the 2 witnesses weren’t resurrected as part of the overall resurrection-rapture but rather as a singular one off event preceding the ‘last day’ resurrection-rapture by some days.The Dome of the rock was built in the year 688A.D 688 + 1260 = 1948The witnesses are not killed in Jerusalem.
Revelation 11 : 8 And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.“Where (also) their Lord was crucified”The United States is the great Babylon (Revelation 17 & 18).
The United States, where every tribe and every nation is gathered. Where Christ was also crucified is explained by seeing all the sins of this nation– in Jesus Name the slaughter of the Indians ( they are actually Hebrew tribes and proven recently by genetic research) the removal of God in education, abortion, homosexuality, lust off the flesh and the boastful pride of life here in America and the churches being nothing more than businesses.The witnesses will either be killed at the United Nation’s building in New York or the Capital building in D.C.The Rapture and the Second Coming are two, separate completely different events.  People often use the terms interchangeably such as ‘dolphin’ and ‘porpoise’ – but they are two different animals!  At the Rapture, Jesus does not come down to earth – we meet Him in the air.  At the Second Coming Jesus returns to earth to destroy the nations that have tormented Israel and her people.Just take notice that there is not enough support for the pre-tribulational rapture; we will be here for at least part of the ApocalypseThat is right…it’s a pre-wrath rapture, JESUS comes at the last trumpet (the 7th one). Rev. 11:15-19…Nowhere does it tell us that it’s going to be before the tribulation, it’s just prior to the last judgments and the Wrath of GOD…YES, Thank you! Good to see somebody has the truth. Rapture He comes with Angels, doesn’t touch the earth  and comes in the clouds.At the 2nd coming…He comes back with His saints, he touches the ground this time and He rides in on a white horse and the saints all follow Him on white horses, then it’s the Battle AT Armageddon. 2 totally different occasions.The Rapture, the 1st Resurrection and the Glorious Appearing of JESUS are ALL one big event, all happen at the same time. JESUS comes and the graves open, the saints are all “called up” out the graves and off the ground.
He’s gonna be waiting for us in the clouds (in the air). It’s going to happen at the 7th trumpet, a pre-wrath rapture.Greg, that is my understanding also.  The main point Christains must be ready at all, any times, no matter who is correct about different arguments, my key to all of this is BeReady.  I am looking so forward to what ever GOD sends our way.  I will state that I enjoy eating and then drinking good COLD water, but if I have to starve to be a member of Heaven’s elect then so be it.
We need to love one another, for so many things are happening so fast thru my eyes I just keep saying, Since God’s in charge and created everything that we can think about or things that we can’t comprehend, my trust is GOD is 100%.  Try to refrain from calling Lrving or anyone else names, all we are trying to do is find out the truth, that 100% I was speaking about earlier.  Only GOD has all the answers, remember that and just always be ready.  Yes that very difficult during these times, we ain’t seen nothing Yet.Jesus coming for His Bride and The Second Coming- Rapture are 2 different events. The first will happen at the end of the Church Age (after God finishes judging His house) and the second at the end of The Great Tribulation(Last trumpet) after the Nations are judged.END TIME SCENARIO
For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. But each in his own order: Christ, the first fruits, after that those who are Christ’s at His coming,                                                    1 Corinthians 15:22,323
(1.)FIRST CATCHING AWAY OR RAPTURE-
The bride is called out from The Church up to The Lord for protection from                                                       The Great Tribulation and The Judgment of The Nations –  after all the Churches                                            (God’s House) have been judged.
“But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.                 ‘ Matthew 25:6
Therefore, come out from among unbelievers, and separate yourselves from them, says the LORD. Don’t touch their filthy things, and I will welcome you. 2 Corinthians 6:17
Then I heard another voice calling from heaven, “Come away from her, my people.      Do not take part in her sins, or you will be punished with her. Revelation 18:4
After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.” Revelation 4:1
Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather there with us. Our God will fight for us!” Nehemiah 4:20(2.) GREAT TRIBULATION –
Those believers  who remain in The churches (after the Bride is taken out ) will suffer and die                      for  their  faith in Christ Jesus and be saved as if by fire.   All others perish or remain alive.
“But while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom came. Then those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was locked. Later, when the other five bridesmaids returned, they stood outside, calling, ‘LORD, LORD! Open the door for us!’ “But he called back, ‘Believe me, I don’t know you!’ Matthew 25:10-12
Jesus replied, “Work hard to enter the narrow door to God’s Kingdom, for many will try to enter but will fail. When the master of the house has locked the door, it will be too late. You will stand outside knocking and pleading, ‘Lord, open the door for us!’ But he will reply, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’ Then you will say, ‘But we ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’ And he will reply, ‘I tell you, I don’t know you or where you come from. Get away from me, all you who do evil.’               Luke 13:24-27
But what if THE SERVANT is evil and thinks, ‘MY MASTER won’t be back for a while,’ and he begins beating the other servants, partying, and getting drunk? The master will return unannounced and unexpected, and he will cut the servant to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Matthew 3:24:48-51
“So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly. For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth. Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.” Luke 21:34-36(3.) SECOND CATCHING AWAY OR RAPTURE AT THE LAST TRUMPET –                                                                      For all believers who are alive and remain when Jesus returns to The Earth.                                                       They will be caught up  to meet Him in the air as He returns.  They will be changed in the  twinkling of an eye.
For THE LORD HIMSELF will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and WITH THE TRUMPET of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. THEN WE WHO ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.                        1 Thessalonians 4:16,17
Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, AT THE LAST TRUMPET; for the trumpet will sound, AND THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED imperishable, AND WE WILL BE CHANGED. For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. 1 Corinthians 15:51,52(4.) Millenium –                                                                                                                                                               The 1000 year Reign of Our Lord and Savior upon The Earth and Satan is bound.
(5.) Satan is released for a short time towards the end of Jesus’ reign to test those upon The Earth.
(6.) The Great White Throne Judgment of God –                                                                                                             He will seperate and judge all He has created                                                                                                                              The good will be rewarded and enjoy life eternally.                                                                                                   The bad will be found guilty and sentenced to death and destruction eternally.
(7.) A  New Heaven an a New Earth will be created-                                                                                                        All those that belong to Jesus  will rule and reign with Him for Ever –                                                                 With God as Our Father.
And you must show mercy to those whose faith is wavering. Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgment. Show mercy to still others, but do so with great caution, hating the sins that contaminate their lives. Jude 1:22,23The Great Tribulation is the time when the Church is purified. There is no pre-tribulation rapture, there is only one, it is the gathering of the Christians not killed during The Great Tribulation. Read Revelation 7 starting at verse 9.What you are expecting will determine what you will prepare for, watch for and be ready for – when it happens.Jesus will RETURN for His Bride – as a Groom
“At midnight someone shouted, ‘The groom is here! Come “out” to meet him!’ Matthew 25:6
“So you, too, must keep watch! For you do not know the day or hour of my RETURN.   Matthew 25:13
When Jesus RETURNS for His bride – He will be “as a thief” in the night – but not to those who are ready!
But know this, that if the master of the house knew in what watch the thief would come, he would watch, and would not suffer his house to be broken up. Matthew 24:43Jesus’ SECOND COMING will be seen by all – He COMES as King of Kings
For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so it will be on the day when the Son of Man COMES.  Luke 17:24
Look! He is COMING in the clouds. Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him. Every tribe on earth will mourn because of him. This is true. Amen. Revelation 1:7Doug let me encourage you to continue here. Both of your posts are well done and apply scripture. I only disagree with your using the prevalent title for the church as “the bride of Christ”. Please show where in scripture the church is called the “bride”. You also realize that Rev. names the bride as the New Jerusalem. Interested in your reply.If you are a follower of Jesus answer my question… If the anti Christ was alive right now who would it be do you think
1. They have to have a lot of power
2. They have to be somewhere besides USAEli, the antichrist may well be alive right now but he will not be revealed until he negotiates the 7 year peace agreement. Then he rises to power so it is not necessary to be a powerful person at the moment. I personally believe he is from somewhere else other than the U.S.He certainly will be a powerful person in order to have the authority to negotiate a binding peace agreement with Israel.im a pre-trib i believe his elect are the 12 tribes of isreal the 144.000 i believe the body of christ is the church and it will be raptured before trib.the 144 000 are sealed on their foreheads to witness in the trib and satancant touch them then they are rapturedI once was a Pre-tribulation believer however after doing my own research on the topic and listening to the Holy Spirit, I came to the conclusion that what I was taught from the beginning was incorrect.  Scriptures makes it clear that it can’t possibly be pre.  People that believes it is pre, for me I think, it has to do more with them believing that God is so good that nothing bad will happen to them so when it comes to the rapture they naturally believe it’s pre.  Can’t be post nor mid because that would make God not look so good in their eyes.  The truth is Jesus said tribulation will come and we will be prosecuted because of him.  Don’t get me wrong, God is indeed Good but we cannot forgot that even when all he’ll breaks loose in our lives…even unto death.  I would rather be
 prepared for the worst  then believe I will be spared and find out at the end that I was not spared.  If it’s pre, then praise God, but if it’s post…then I will be ready and prepared for what’s to come unlike pre-believers….they won’t be. “In these
days many will turn away from their faith and will betray and  hate each other”.I used to be pre-trib also. After years of studying, and lots of research I have concluded it’s going to be a PRE-WRATH rapture of the church.
JESUS will appear (the glorious appearing) and that will be at the 7th trumpet of Revelation. Read Rev. 11:15-19 and that explains it all. At that trumpet (which is just before the 1st bowl/vial judgment and the wrath of GOD), JESUS will take possession of this world “away” from satan (the god of this evil world). The graves will open, there will be judgment, and the ARK of the Covenant will be seen at that time.
There is NO other place where the rapture could be, nothing else is biblical. He will come just prior to the outpouring of all 7 of the vial judgments, as the angel was told to go and pour out the vials of the WRATH of GOD onto the earth Rev. 16:1…these are the last 7 plagues (judgments) that will be happening.
And in Rev. 13:7…It says it was given to the antichrist to make “WAR” with the saints and to overcome them.
Rev. 14:9-10…And the 3rd angel followed them saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand.10. The same shall drink of the wine of the WRATH OF GOD, which is poured out without mixture etc.
Now, back in Rev. 12:12 we find…Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the DEVIL is come down unto you, having GREAT WRATH, because he knoweth that he has but a short time.
Satan’s wrath will be the tribulation (seals and trumpets), and GOD’s wrath is the last 7 bowl vial judgments…You are correct Mr. Feshamon. The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 24, “he who endures to the end will be saved”.
I pray for you in Jesus Name Mr. Feshamon, that you are provided for during The Great Tribulation, and that you see The Lord’s return. In Jesus Name I pray this for you. AmenPlease tell me the ref. in Revelation where the 144,000 Jews end up witnessing. I can’t recall a single reference – I think they’re only mentioned a couple of times (in Rev 7 & 14). To me this is yet another convenient example of EISegesis by pre-trib advocates to explain how there can be Christian believers around in the tribulation when the rapture supposedly took all believers beforehand.To make it even easier here are the two full refs (you can’t just read something into these just to suit your desired outcome):Revelation 14
New International Version (NIV)The Lamb and the 144,000
14 Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. 2 And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. 3 And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 4 These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. 5 No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.Revelation 7New International Version (NIV)144,000 Sealed
7 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. 2 Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: 3 “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” 4 Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.
5 From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed,
from the tribe of Reuben 12,000,
from the tribe of Gad 12,000,
6 from the tribe of Asher 12,000,
from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000,
from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,
7 from the tribe of Simeon 12,000,
from the tribe of Levi 12,000,
from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,
8 from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000,
from the tribe of Joseph 12,000,
from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.Hi
 It really not hard to see  as the very next verses explain , even though it is not explicit we have to acknowledge that our GOD does everything with purpose and design and the following verses in reference to this show-
9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;10 And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.
As Herod tried to kill every male child 2 years and younger in an attempt to kill the messiah before his ministry even started , likewise ha-satan can read and understand the scriptures and if every detail to understanding Gods plan was given to us it would also be given to the enemy as well . There has to be a very good reason for the 144000 to be given mention and a special level of protection , if the believers were not here it makes good sense that the 144000 are protected so that more people could repent and become Christians themselves even if there were no others believers on earth.
Plus there is no logic for an exclusive 144000 to have protection from harm if there were still millions of believers on earththere are a number of OT prophecies about a “remnant” being preserved ….it will be simply on “account of the patriarchs” *ie Abraham etc…)…and also so that along with those who are Abrahams seed by faith (Christians) so also a remnant of the natural descendants of Israel (Jacob) will be preserved so that “ALL (natural AND ‘grafted in’) Israel will be saved” (Romans 9-11). Who says the 144,000 have EXCLUSIVE protection? Believers  will already have a seal ‘unto the day of redemption’ (Eph 1:13,14) so why would Revelation need to mention that ?Marie, you say you believe that the church is the “body of Christ”. Since the body of Christ are the body of believers and there is an almost innumerable number of believers living and dying in the tribulation, how do you conclude that the church has been raptured before the tribulation begins. If you are about to reply that they are two different groups of believers then you need to explain how and when Jesus divided His church into two parts and then how these believers from the tribulation get their glorified bodies. Is there a second rapture?To Irvine Baxter:I think you are fake and a fraud Irvine who relies heavily on the Old Testament in order to lay guilt and shame on people. The Old Testament is an administration of pure death; a schoolmaster to lead us to Jesus Christ. Moses could not even keep the Mosaic System, and yes I am also referring to the Big Ten. After we accept Jesus Christ as Savior, he literally enters our heart, for he is omnipresent. We then have Jesus, the third member of the Trinity as our Ultimate and Forever Friend. We are God’s Inheritance, and he is our inheritance, including the heavenly dimension and those in it-vice versa as well, speaking of Heaven and Eternal Paradise. As a Christian we are Bought with a Price, or Not. I am Blood Bought, Supernaturally. Christ’s blood is inestimable, the Most Precious Commodity on Earth. How does your Golden Calf in its Various Forms look compared to What Jesus Did. Heaven is a Perfect Place, and for that Reason it Required a Perfect Sacrifice (Jesus, God’s One and Only Son). Jesus is Lord of the Manor, if you will; that is, planet earth and the Universe. He is going to show that at his Physical and literal Return. Jesus Killed the School-Master, for me and other true Christians. So the old-schoolmaster took the money and left you in the gutter, Scott Lunsford and Elk-referring to the heretical Masonic Lodge, and Mormons. Jesus is always available, especially to the Lost House of Israel. The Jews and Gentile’s who have been grafted in are now a completely different tree (Christian), Sanctified by the Shed Blood of Christ, that is Set Apart. As Christians we can go directly to Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit. I am Redempto- Centric, are you Irvine. I have been Tabernacled. True, on the cross God turned his back on Christ for the last fragment of time before Christ volitionally gave up his Spirit, but the Holy Spirit Never Left, as All the world’s Malice and Evil, Sin, Past, Present and Future bored into Christ, including all the physical suffering world over-into the Millinieum and beyond, for All of the Fallen World, including you and me, Everyone. Perhaps in the Process of God’s Time the Fallen Angels, who knows. Christ did all the Work, and I mean All of it. Irvine don’t be a Monolithic Money Changer. A Mohammedite. Moses is interesting but get the Full and Forever power in Jesus. And Hammon, well we know what happened to him. The True water is in God’s Word, a fountain head of truth; For true Christians the gentle Jesus is our new schoolmaster, not Moses. There is not one covenant for the Jews, the Islamic people, and one for Christians. When Christ died, rose, and ascended the Universe and everyone in it entered a new Covenant, the age of Grace, drawn exclusively from Emmanuel’s Veins: Martin Luther fully understood this. It has been Satan’s chief aim to throw to degrade and throw this Cosmos into regression and retrograde motion, referring to God’s Salvation Plan. Dr. Karpov, the Anti-Christ, entitled Abdullah 2’s main aim is take over planet earth and all of his creation, forever. Not going to happen; The Bible literally bears all that out into the upcoming penultamet Battle and the Final Battle, which occurs at the end of the 1000year Reign of Peace, Rightousness, and Justice, with King Jesus at the Head.Bradley Forest Lunsford (please ignore spelling and grammatically incorrect sentences- Chico State University; History and Philosophy and Religious Studies-Spring of 09.Ha?  You too much.Hi, BradI’ve been surfing through Irwin’s teaching and the comments to it, to get some ideas for a sermon I need to teach tomorrow night.  Frankly, I’m not too interestes in the rapture, and don’t plan on teaching about it.  Your blast at Irvine here might give me some ideas, though; so let me dig into what you said.1. Irvine is not a fake nor a fraud; and I wonder what office you suppose yourself to hold in this matter.  Are you specially gifted as a “Fraud-Finder”?  God forbid, then, if I should call YOU a fraud — a fraudulent Fraud-Finder; seeing that I do not personally feel so gifted.  Oh well, moving on…You seem to be down on the Old Testament.  Interesting, that, seeing that the OT is the “scriptures” that Jesus, Paul and all the others expounded on (There WAS no New Testament in those days)…Can’t keep the “Big Ten”?  I can see your having trouble keeping the Sabbath; but really, do you have a continual urge to dishonor your parents?  to lie under oath?  to have sex with your neighbor’s wife?  to covet and steal?  If you do, how is it that you think Jesus has entered your heart?You say Jesus is our “Forever Friend”; and I don’t dispute this; but I think “Friend Jesus” will have to deal with you about some of your attitudes — especially those against our brother Irvine.  Are you that cock-sure about your judgment of Irv?  Irv is part of the Body of Christ.  I don’t agree with half of what he says, which is par for a brother — even a brother in the flesh.  He is my brother, though; and if he were my fleshly brother, you might merit a punch in the snout for saying what you did to him.Yes, the Bible is a schoolmaster, to lead us to Christ — not to PROFESSING Christ, but to actually knowing him.  He learned obedience, through the things he suffered.  If you keep going on the track you’re on, you will certainly suffer.  I hope you learn obedience through it all, as Jesus did.God bless and keep you.Your brother, MichaelGood job MichaelWandakate, Sorry, I just found your post from back in Dec. I am in middle, s. of Nash, w. of Murfreesboro and e. of Franklin.THN URA POST RAPTURE BELIEVER,  CORRECT?  I AM A PRE TRIB BELIEVER.Then you’re in for a surprise (not a pleasant one)You are entitled to your opinion but love your brothers and sisters in Christ even if you do not agree , as Christ asked each of us 🙂
You are likely to be surprised 🙂 in a good wayNot so 🙂 the bible is very clear – it doesn’t deal in guesswork…it’s flawed teachers that muddy the waters….Yes the waters get muddy ,
when people profess things that are misleading 🙂As per my post of Dec 15:-December 15, 2015 at 1:23 pm
“I’ve updated my view of HARLOTS below to consist of Jews AS WELL AS ‘fallen away’ protestants.”http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35336807I cant help but think that the rapture occurs mid and not pre. The reason being: when John is told to come up…clearly here John can not be representing the church. Why??..beca use the church throughout the scritures is represented as a woman..bride to Christ.Either you way you get to miss the antichrists unveiling ??? – I think not 🙁 – It’s ‘post’ I’m afraidYou’re right about John not representing the Church – that’s just eisegesis gone mad.The church doesn’t go anywhere ’til the LAST day resurrection-rapture  (except for the martyrs) – the church gets split into two camps (polarized) – the apostate (part of the pope’s false religious union) and the true believersVery good observation…Most Christians think that when John heard “come up here”, it meant that the church was leaving the earth. Many pastors including John Hagee teach this very thing. John wasn’t the church. GOD was speaking directly to John, wanting him to come up to where GOD was so that GOD could show him what was going to take place in the end of days. John was going back and forth from heaven to earth in these visions that he had.
It’s good that you realize the church was represented as a woman and not that it was the church that was going up with GOD called John only. The rapture is at the last trumpet, the 7th one to be exact. See Rev. 11:15-19 and that is when JESUS comes and takes possession of the earth away from satan. It’s not any of those, it’s a Pre-Wrath Rapture of the church. JESUS comes just prior to the last 7 bowl/vial judgments (plagues). The church IS NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD, therefore JESUS comes and removes the dead in their graves and the ones alive all at the same time. He will appear in the clouds with angels and call up (rapture) all of His saved ones at once. The rapture, the 1st resurrection and the glorious appearing all happen at the same time, they are all the big event.I have believed for 15 years that Revelations 14:14-16, described the the “Rapture”.  It’s easier to sell we’ll all be gone before it happens.
Allenof course it as and therefore profitable (also no loss of face if, as a well known minister, you stick to the story you’ve believed for so long but then suddenly realise the truth) – so that’s greed and pride in there already – not to mention the heavy punishment promised those promulgating false teaching (especially knowingly)I know that there are people who believe in pre, mid and post rapture and have the scripture to back up their beliefs. Ive never really had a preference because its so confusing. I don’t know what to believe. But I’m thinking…if the Christians are persecuted to death in the tribulation, then who will Jesus rapture? Any thoughts?Katy do you know the verse in Matt I think where it says ‘…but for the sake of the elect shall those days be shortened…’ I take the ‘elect’ in this instance to be those elected for physical survival ’til the end. God cuts the martyrdom short when the ‘full quota(number) of martyrs’ mentioned at seal 5 is completed. This number is designated by God and is not ALL believers around at that time. So there you have your rapture candidates – a small group indeed in all likelihood (‘…when the son of man comes shall he find faith on the earth ?…..)BTW there are no serious scriptural refs to exegetically prove pre or mid – it’s all just the flesh , wishful thinking and profit mongering wolves in sheeps clothingBTW also…if you find it confusing always boil it down to it’s simplest and most reliable element – the very words of Jesus Himself in Matt 24….Immediately AFTER the TRIBULATION of those days…..THEN….THEN….THEN He shall GATHER (resurrection-rapture) His elect – and don’t buy into this nonsense that the elect is referring exclusively to Jews – satan is throwing all kinds of curve balls to detract from the truth. Another curve ball is that the TRIBULATION is the first half of the ‘7’ and the GREAT TRIBULATION is the 2nd half of the 7. If you read Matt 24 very carefully you’ll see that it’s ALL referring to the  SECOND half of the ‘7’ (i.e. post abom. of desol.) and = GREAT TRIBULATION = TRIBULATION (one and the same period). This curve ball is used as an argument to prove ‘mid point’ raptureApologies you also need to cross reference with:-Dan 9
27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the MIDDLE OF THE WEEK he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of ABOMINATIONS he shall make it DESOLATE, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.i.e. the persecution of Gods people begins ‘in earnest’ at the midpoint of the week (ABOMINATION of DESOLATION)sorry ..a more readable translation is Dan 9
27 He will confirm a covenant with many for one “seven”.[a] In the middle of the “seven”[b] he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple[c] he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.[d]’[e]Jesus speaking in plain language like this is enough for me. Can I give you some more though which I believe together also nails down the timing of the rapture in relation to the tribulation ?Rev 20
4 I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They[a] had NOT WORSHIPED THE BEAST or its image and had NOT RECEIVED ITS MARK on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 5 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the FIRST RESURRECTION.1 Thess 4:15
15 According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will CERTAINLY NOT PRECEDE who have fallen asleep.(First let me clarify things about the last scripture:
1.Those who are still alive are the ones who get bodily raptured
2.The ones ‘fallen asleep’ means those who died (i.e. get resurrected not ‘raptured’)
3.certainly not precede means ‘will not go first’.
What this means in a nutshell is that come the ‘gathering of the wheat’ there’s a strict QUEUE namely:-The dead in Christ are RESURRECTEDTHEN AFTER THAT EVENTThe living are rapturedNow put these 2 scriptures together and what do you see ?1.The FIRST resurrection contains those who encountered the MARK and the BEAST2.The rapture of the living STRICTLY FOLLOWS that event in sequencegeddit ?Now pit that against all the lengthy flowery unsubstantial verbal gymnastics of pre-trib teachers…)BTW The 2nd resurrection is that of the wicked 1000 years laterSorry also I didn’t really emphasize this but:1. Revelation makes it clear there’s only 1 resurrection of the righteous
2. That FIRST and ONLY such resurrection (of the dead) comes AFTER the MARK and the BEAST but BEFORE the rapture
3. Therefore the MARK and the BEAST come before the rapture !!i.e. in chronological order:1.MARK and BEAST
2. Resurrection of the righteous dead
3. Rapture of the righteous livingI can help you out with that. I just last month published a book entitled The Timing of the Rapture that goes into great detail on the three major views (pre-, mid-, post-) and systematically dissects them to lead to a logical conclusion, specifically a post-Trib rapture. I moved into the post-Trib camp about 25 years ago after being a pre-Tribber for about 20 years.  I got fed up with the confusion and the same old ideas regurgitated without serious exegesis of the specific passages that address the issue.  Before I switched positions, in my own mind I had to be able to identify which position could address all the deficiencies of the other position and which could also successfully defend the objections of the other position.  That position is the post-Trib position.  I go into detail what the Feasts of Israel teach about the rapture, who really is the restrainer of 2 Thes. 2, is the “imminence” issue really what the pre-Tribbers say (no), the difference between revivification and resurrection, the difference between judgment and wrath, the Day of the Lord, what are the meanings of the trumpets and the “mystery” mentioned in Revelation and 1 Corinthians, is the Trib 3.5 years or 7 years, etc.  Even if nobody reads it, at least I got it off my chest.  Whether you check it out or not, I wish you well in your studies.I am deeply touched and enriched by this teaching. God bless you man of God.Did your sister plasma nyang I pray we shall all make heaven in
Jesus name.You said if a person would die right now he would immediately stand before the Lord for judgement? whatever happened to the resurrection for this person that just died? Please explain.Let’s all pray for man kind to be safe . No matter what you believe.
Jesus loves his children compleltey. So relax when it’s end times come.
PRAY PRAY!! It’s all we can do.we are not in charge. REV robert wilsonThe best and most accurate teaching I have ever heard on this misconstrued subject everMichael S:  I have responded to your post dated January 12, 2016 at 11:29 pm with a proof of why the two witnesses can’t be the Jewish people and the Gentile ChurchChallenge to pre-tribbers:  Please show me a verse in Revelation which expressly says that the 144,000 Jews GO ABOUT WITNESSING (and therefore presumably converting many to the Christian faith). If you can’t please tell me how there can be Christians in the final 3.5 years around since the great commission in Matt 28 shows that Jesus delegated BELIEVERS to bring others to faith and since presumably all Christians were snatched away beforehand ?Kev. Have you considered the 144 as perhaps the angels of God that were deceived by the devil to begin with? Consider this next time you read Revelation chapters 7,8,9,10,and 11. Just one more thought or question How does one get the victory over the mark of the beast and the number of his name? or, if I have read correctly in some of your posts; we are here through that time otherwise called the abomination of desolation? or do we get to leave that time of the beast? love to no your thoughts on this. God Bless.Rev 7 says very clearly that the 144,000 are native Israelites (12,000 from each of certain tribes) – no need to allegorize this.Victory over the mark simply means NEVER TAKING it even if it means our death. I know  death doesn’t sound like victory but if you stay faithful to the end and refuse the mark to the end the eternal consequences are for more preferable – to me that’s victory ! Elsewhere we are told that “they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony” – I’m still not completely sure what that equates to… suffice to say something along the lines of maintaining faith in Christ and His work and confessing Him even to death and of course outright refusing to take the mark of the beast.We are here (unless martyred or die naturally) – right to the very end of the 7 years ie we get to see the abomination of desolation and all of what follows….Slight correction….the Rev 12:11 reference11 They triumphed over him
    by the blood of the Lamb
    and by the word of their testimony;
they did not love their lives so much
    as to shrink from death.….relates more directly to the “accuser of the brethren” (ie the devil)You stopped at verse 8, why did you not continue ?
As stated earlier there is a Design to the way GOD does things and the only inference or implied context in all of scripture is that they play a role in evangelizing during the great trib . There is no reference of them doing anything else , surely you would not think that our Great God would pull a trick on his beloved children to throw in a reference to a very special people just to trip us up 🙂Just because the 144,000 and the great multitude are in the same chapter doesn’t mean the former gave rise to the letter.
Inspecting the chronology shows that these 2 scenes occur between the 6th seal (ch 6) (warnings of judgment) and 7th seal (actual judgment) – ch 8 – the 7th seal following very shortly after the 6th. Your idea would imply that the 144,000 would have to evangelise this great multitude at breakneck speed (almost at the unbelievable speed that Santa Claus would have to deliver presents on to everyone on Christmas Eve 🙂 ). They’re both fables.
The 144,000 natural Israelites, as I see it, are preserved simply “on account of the patriarchs”.It’s almost like God is simply providing an occasional status update on two groups of people who are very significant to Him.Hi All.
I agree with what Irvin Baxter teaches on the Rapture.
This is the reason why: I got saved and filled with the Holy Spirit in 1986. By 1988, I started having visions. I had prayed about the scriptures that said it was better to prophesy than to speak in tongues. Anyway, I started receiving the same messages from God about the same time Irvin was hearing the same things from God. We are two separate people, living in different areas, neither one of us knows the other person. How is it possible that the Lord started telling us the same things about it? Only God can and does do that.
I did not hear it from my minister. I was at home alone reading by Bible and studying it when the Lord opened my eyes to it. As Irvin previously stated, our churches were teaching pre trib. The idea was that God would not allow his saints to suffer through the tribulation. Yet the Bible teaches we will be hated by men, tortured and persecuted for our beliefs. We already see how saints in Africa are tortured and murdered. There are others around the world who are. The Apostles were killed. Why would we be exempt if none of them were? Does any of that make sense to anyone?The word of God is spirit and they are life; to really understand what we read, why don’t we ask the Holy Spirit to reveal their true meaning to us?  Instead of asking men, seek The Holy Spirit.  After all, the Holy Spirit if God is our Teacher, Guide, Helper and Comforter.  Give  Him time and room to answer your questions. He will lead you into all the TruthSometimes when I read my Bible it seems that someone is making things so clear to me. It doesn’t happen all the time, I wish it did. As of late, the real meaning, and depth, of repentance has become clearer to me. I only read or listen to three Pastors/ scholars and I am content with that. Sugarcoating the Bible is not how I want to be taught. Thank you,what if our loved ones have taken the mark of the beast,do we come out from them and stop praying for hope for them to be saved?The problem is where will our allegiance be? IF anyone takes the mark, they have chosen to be obedient to the antichrist, and they have disowned GOD’s blessings at that time. They have made their eternal choice to go to “hell”. There is no turning back at that point. Once our loved ones take that mark, there is no prayer to save them, they have made their choice of their own free will. They need to be saved NOW, then will be TOO LATE!it’s also the case that anyone previously ‘saved’ will irretrievably lose their salvation if they take the mark. If they believed the ‘pre-trib rapture’ and ‘once saved always saved’ and they realise after A/C’s appearing that the first was untrue they might count on  OSAS to see them through (i.e. to take the mark whilst saved just so that they can buy and sell and generally get by) – but the book is clear…God’s wrath falls on ALL who take the mark. What we need to understand is that these are all doctrines of demons designed to ensnare believers one way or another. A/C won’t force the mark – he will want voluntary worship because he (or rather the devil who animates him) desires to be equal with God (and has done since ages past…Isaiah 14
“How you are fallen from heaven,
O Lucifer,[b] son of the morning!
How you are cut down to the ground,
You who weakened the nations!
13 For you have said in your heart:
‘I will ascend into heaven,
I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;
I will also sit on the mount of the congregation
On the farthest sides of the north;
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
I WILL BE LIKE THE MOST HIGH.’
15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol,
To the lowest depths of the Pit.to clarify…when I say he won’t “force” the mark what I mean is that he won’t tie our hands behind our backs and hold us down and put it in us with us kicking and screaming “NO DON’T !!” BUT RATHER it will be coercion in that we won’t get to eat, drink, live in a home, hold down a job, be able to trust anyone (other than fellow believers who stay true) i.e. generally FUNCTION in any way – now some people would call that “forcing” but it’s not in the most extreme sense of the word. Incidentally I understand we can’t survive (naturally) more than a few days without water !sorry…I didn’t want to give the impression that these were the only methods of martyring…obviously seal 5 indicates beheading too….as I see it you can only be beheaded if you are captive. If you evade capture, however, the other methods would take are of it.Kev
So at this point what WILL you do?????Also, exactly what is the mark, is it not worshiping on Sat. Vs Sunday.  Please Kev take me serious, I have read this on End Time Ministries or saw on video.  Help me out please!!!just spotted this error of mine….seal 5 does not specifically indicate beheading but Rev 20 (tribulation martyrs) does . The Greek word behind seal 5 is a more general word implying a painful or violent death. This is one reason why I don’t consider the seal 5 martyrs to be tribulation martyrs but rather the former group seem to be a historical group of martyrs.Forget most everything I said, I could not re-read my comment until I submitted it, then it’s to late.
Again the way this has been formatted you can’t do what I suggested.
Sorry for wasting your time!!!ok all …..somethings been really bugging me of late.Please note it doesn’t negate the post tribulation rapture – it just might upset what a lot of us have been led to believe to date about who gets to partake in the 1st and who in the 2nd resurrection:Firstly Rev 20
4 I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They[a] had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 5 (THE REST OF THE DEAD DID NOT COME TO LIFE UNTIL THE THOUSAND YEARS WERE ENDED.) This is the first resurrection. 6 Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.Now note what this appears to be (in fact to me IS) saying:……..that ONLY the the dead and the raptured living who successfully ovecame in the tribulation get to be raptured and resurrected as part of the 1st resurrection at Christ’s coming on the last day and THEY ALONE are the one’s who get to rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years (ie not others of Gods faithful from ages past) – and are considered BLESSED.NOTE: It says the SECOND DEATH HAS NO POWER OVER THEM…..BUT how can it be automatically taken from this that the SECOND DEATH HAS POWER OVER ‘ALL’ RESURRECTED AT THE 2ND RESURRECTION 1,000 YEARS LATER ??Note where it says THE REST OF THE DEAD note it DOESNT SAY….’AND THE WICKED DID NOT COME TO LIFE UNTIL THE THOUSAND YEARS WERE ENDED’Bear with me at this point and read on…Rev 20
12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done. 14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. 15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.My question is why would the book of life need to be opened at the 2nd resurrection if it only consisted of the wicked anyway ?My proposal therefore to you is that the dead and living who overcome through the final tribulation are the only ones in the 1st resurrection and that …the 2nd resurrection consists of all the wicked  PLUS the remainder of God’s faithful who missed the tribulationNotice that Daniel 12
2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.doesn’t contradict thisCan anyone provide scripture to dispute this ? If not then I am sorely inclined to consider this fact from now on……..Remember the verse which says “Many that are first shall be last and the last first” – perhaps there’s a new slant on that verse ??Noticing the ‘And’ in verse 4….perhaps the tribulation overcomers become priests and the rest of us judges ? Does anyone else find this scripture challenging / confusing ?ok looking at Rev 3
21 To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne.  Heb 11
35 Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain AN EVEN BETTER RESURRECTION.  36 Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.  37 They were put to death by stoning;[e] they were sawn in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and ill-treated –  38 the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.These two refs. and the above rf in Rev 20 seems to suggest to me that only the victorious / overcomers (even in the severest of tests) will be included in the first (‘the even better’) resurrection. The ‘And’ in Rev 20:40 suggests to me that overcomers (in trials etc…) who lived prior to the great tribulation are the ‘judges’ referred to.sorry meant Rev 20:4Kev, thanks for your correction…where you stated sorry meant Rev 20:4.
Everyone I feel should read there comment making sure that what you have in your comment makes sense to everyone reading what was said, either in giving a reply or making a comment.My life hangs on comments made to a point, so many people are reading the comments being made sometimes can get confused to mis-leading comments (not being made on purpose) example from comment made by : his servant made feb. 17, 2016.  Then reply by wandakate feb. 22, 2022.I don’t know what bible you are referring to:After you comment please read again making sure it makes sense to us readers that are here to learn all we can.  I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page, thereby people like myself needs as good of understanding that God thru a Christain can read these comments taking away Gods truth that he wants Christains to get from what’s being said.
I pray that I have not upset anyone here, not wanting to do that.
I will re- read what I have written trying to make sure that my point will be understood.  Well it hard to read again the way things are formatted!!
BillForget most everything I said, I could not re-read my comment until I submitted it, then it’s to late.
Again the way this has been formatted you can’t do what I suggested.
Sorry for wasting your time!!!Thank you for your timely answer.  I know it is not a salvation matter.  I can’t understanding God’s elect living thru the seals and trumpets.  They are going to be unbelievable times.  And what about the mark of the beast it buy food.  He won’t get to everyone but it will be living off the land to survive.You have convinced me ,Kevin.  But the prsecution during the tribulation will be like nothing ever imagined.  I am 71 years old and I pray God I will pass from this life before that happens.  Even though  those that die before the tribulation will not live through the millimemonYou have convinced me Kevin.  I was blinded to the truth.  I am 71 yrs old and I pray God I will pass from this life before the tribulation.  I can’t imagine seeing such terrible things that are coming.  Even though the dead in Christ will not reign in the millennium we will be in heaven.  Absent from the body be with the Lord.Susan…only the “spirit” leaves the body and goes to be in heaven for safe keeping until it is returned to the body/soul in the grave. Remember, JESUS said, “FATHER, into they hands I commit my “spirit.” It wasn’t a soul that left but the “spirit”. When GOD created man, he created Adam, and He told us that Adam was a SOUL! Adam it says in Genesis became a living “soul”.
The soul sins, and it goes to the grave, the spirit goes to heaven and will return to the person at the 1st resurrection.
We are NOT immortal, so we die, the soul dies. Remember, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.”
Yes, we will be here for the seals and trumpets. That is the wrath of satan, but the last 7 are vial judgments and they come directly out of heaven from GOD. They will be the wrath of GOD.
He will take you before it happens or he will protect you spiritually. We may die a physical death, but spiritually we’ll be okay. I wish you had a copy of my new book, it explains this, but Irvin has many great teaching tools too.
Blessings…Excellent! THere is some new info .. maybe old to you.. but i believe this is true.cathy hamlett.. she was raised as an illuminati satanist .. her family was embedded in it. raised her in it. she now loves the Lord..
she reports the same thing the bible tells us.. she explains the scripture on ‘he comes as an angel of light’ his plan is to come in the sky.. illuminate himself and say that he is the 2nd coming of Christ.. he will look just like people will expect Jesus to look like.. he will say what people expect Jesus to say when He comes.. people will want to go with him..But it will NOT be Jesus.. oh one more thing.. the anti-Christ’s illuminated appearance when he comes will look the form of a christmas tree.. kinda like the form of a fat man… the mans body will look skinny on top and fat on bottom like a christmas tree.. not like the bible describes Jesus when he comes.. There are things that will show that he isn’t Christ.. 1) the bible tells us over and over that Christ won’t come in the sky alone .. He will come in the sky and 2) touch His feet onto the Mount of Olives.. AND 3) the 144,000 will be with Him.. 4) AND THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL SEE HIM WHEN HE COMES…the whole world risks being deceived if they don”t study the bible, because the bible tells us the entire truth about all of the things to come.. it is our end times manual.. we must use it if we are to come through victoriousbe aware my friends.. this may sound like conspiracy theory.. but it doesn’t hurt to take in information that may help us when the time of tribulation comes.. especially to pray about it to see if the Lord confirms it to your spirit.His Servant: Not sure what bible you’re reading from or where you got this info. but when JESUS comes it, first of all will NOT be secret. It will be loud (with the trumpet) and very visible.
He’s coming in the clouds and He will be accompanied by a multitude of heavenly ANGELS. He’s NOT going to touch the ground. He’s calling up the saints that are in their graves, and taking the ones that are alive at that time.
They will rise up and go with Him and the angels.
Rev. 11:15-18 will tell us when…at the 7th trumpet, and at that time He will take possession of the earth from satan (the god of this world). The grave will open, time to be judged, and the Ark of the Covenant will even be seen.
So, none of this matches what you have said, and my info comes from the KJV of the Holy Bible. The rapture, the 1st resurrection and the glorious appearing of JESUS are ALL ONE BIG EVENT! blessings…and when you know the truth, the truth will set you free.In reference to Daniel 12, the end of days Great Tribulation, The Lord Jesus says this in Matthew 24: 9 “Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. 10 At that time many will [d]fall away and will betray one another and hate one another. 11 Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. 12 Because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved. 14 This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole [g]world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.Perilous Times
15 “Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), 16 then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. 17 Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house. 18 Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 20 But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath. 21 For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will. 22 Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 23 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘There He is,’ do not believe him. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will [n]show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the [p]elect. 25 Behold, I have told you in advance. 26 So if they say to you, ‘Behold, He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or, ‘Behold, He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe them. 27 For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.The Glorious Return
29 “But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. 31 And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.“But woe to those that are pregnant and nursing babies in those times”, what is meant by that statement.  Maybe it will be very hard for those females due to their circumstance.  Also, but pray that your flight will not be in winter or on a Sabbath.  Would like someone to give their thoughts on what God means by that.Been a follower of Endtime Ministries for over 20 years.  If we are to believe that the Rapture occurs before the wrath of God, ie, the vials….” The reaping of the good harvest of the earth is the rapture of the church. This harvest that He reaps is immediately before the wrath of God, described in Revelation 14:17-20. Thus, the rapture of the church occurs just prior to God’s wrath”..why then does Rev.16: 15, give a last minute warning of the Lord coming as a thief in the night?  This is between the 6th and 7th vial, after the Euphrates River drying up?  The Quotation marks are relating to the above mentioned text!  Your answer would be appreciated!!AT LAST someone who sees what I saw 4 years ago ! My firm belief is that Jesus will come again at the junction of the 7th seal, 7th trumpet and 7th bowl because based on Rev 10 and the account of Joshua and Jericho I’m convinced that the 7th trumpet is a LONG blast during which ALL the bowls are delivered. I believe it has to be of certain duration in order for the 6th bowl gathering of armies to take place. Daniel says that A/C will be given authority for 1,260 days so it’s my contention that the 7th trumpet STOPS sounding, a/c knows the end time calendar and the worlds armies schedule their meeting to fight Jesus on this day, and the 7th bowl is delivered and the kingdom is at this point declared to belong to Christ. Jesus coming in the clouds coincides with the resurrection-rapture of (as I see it) the ‘overcomers’ from all generations who have earned the right to reign with Christ for a thousand years…The glorious appearing of YESHUA-JESUS and the 1st resurrection of the saints and the “catching up”, or the “rapture” are ALL one big event, all happening at the same time. JESUS appears w/Angels in the clouds, the graves all open, and the saints alive will rise up and meet the LORD JESUS in the air. It’s all going to happen…it’s one big cataclysmic event. The wrath of satan are the seal and trumpet judgments. The church IS NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD, (the final bowl/vial judgments), therefore just prior to the “wrath of GOD” (the great tribulation) JESUS will come for the church. We will be gone by time GOD pours the 7 last judgments onto the unrepentant sinners. It’s a PRE-WRATH Rapture of the church…Nobody is going anywhere until the 7th trumpet sounds! Rev. 11:15-19.You should prepare for The Great Tribulation Wandakate.
Even Daniel was shaken by the prophesy of this event.According to Daniel 12 and the end of days Great Tribulation, it is a 1335 day event, and a severe warning of a time never before seen. Even Daniel was shaken by this prophecy and was reassured by the angel of The Lord this event would not come in his time.According to The Lord Jesus also explaining the prophecy given to Daniel in Matthew 24: 9 “Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. 10 At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another. 11 Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. 12 Because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved. 14 This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.Perilous Times
15 “Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), 16 then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. 17 Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house. 18 Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 20 But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath. 21 For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will. 22 Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 23 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘There He is,’ do not believe him. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect. 25 Behold, I have told you in advance. 26 So if they say to you, ‘Behold, He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or, ‘Behold, He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe them. 27 For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.The Glorious Return
29 “But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. 31 And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.Daniel 12 : 11 From the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. 12 How blessed is he who keeps waiting and attains to the 1,335 days!ok granted I have often puzzled over this extra 75 days. Daniel is very clear that a/c only reigns for 1,260 days (time, times and half a time = 3.5 prophetic years).We also know from Rev 16 that during the bowls the beast still has a throne (i.e. reigns).This leads me to conclude that the bowls conclude at the 1,260 day mark – the point where (as I see it) the 7th trumpet STOPS blowing and the kingdom is declared to now belong to Christ.You seem to be implying that the rapture occurs at the 1,335 days so what exactly is going on in those 75 days ?Armageddon where the worlds armies are gathered (grape harvest) against Jesus is where the beast and false
 prophet are assign directly to the lake of fire (Rev 20). I take this to happen at the end of a/c’s reign ie 1,260 days.Yet if the rapture is 75 days later it’s hardly simultaneous with the grape harvest.I would love to hear your (or anyone’s) take on what happens during the 75 days from start to end (pref. backed up with scripture) as it’s still a bit confusing to me.Lisa and Kev the reason that Daniel mentions an additional 30 days (1,290) and then another additional 45 days (1,335) is because those days are for the battle of Armageddon and the Wrath of God poured out.  Blessed is he who comes to the 1,335th day is said because that is when Jesus millennial reign starts.    Kev the rapture can in no way occur between the 6th and 7th vial and there is no scripture that supports that.  Revelation 14, 15, and 16 clearly shows the harvest is done before the bowls/vials of God’s wrath is poured out.  Placing believers during the Wrath of God being poured out completely denies the promise by the Lord that we are not appointed to face His wrath.Joe I’m not sure you’ll get an answer from endtime on this but I believe I understand where the ‘pre-bowls rapture’ comes from:The two harvests described in Rev 14 depict the gathering of the wheat (elect) and the grapes (wicked). I think what has happened is that because POSITIONALLY in the text of Revelation  this description of the two harvests appears before the bowls begin to be described (Rev 15 & 16) a simplistic conclusion was drawn that the 2 harvests occur before ALL the bowls. What was not taken account of however is that whilst Rev is indeed BROADLY chronological it is not RIGIDLY chronological. There are a number of places where ‘flashbacks’ occur (eg Rev 12 satan’s origin and historic attempts to destroy who he believed to be the Messiah – ie Moses , Jesus) and in Rev 11 it backs up to the midpoint to introduce the 2 witnesses. The Rev 14 harvests however are a ‘flashforward’ which is a more in depth depiction of the 2 harvests which actually, in time, occur between bowls 6 and 7 (the harvest of grapes is actually just the gathering of the worlds wicked armies and since the 2 harvests from the parable of the sower are immediately back to back then the rapture also occurs between bowls 6 and 7 – the thief in the night). If this ‘flashforward’ depiction was inserted in between the bowl 6 and 7 depiction it would unduly interrupt the flow of the bowls depiction in Rev 16.For any who contend that God’s people will not be around for the bowls (which as they see it alone constitute the wrath):-A careful inspection of the 6th seal text clearly shows that God’s wrath comes at the 7th seal and constitutes the bowls AND the trumpets.So…1) If both the trumpets and bowls are all God’s wrath then why are we left around for the ‘trumpet’ wrath but taken away for the ‘bowls’ wrath.2) The bowls being the ‘filling up’ of God’s wrath according to Thayer indicate that the bowls are the ‘topping up’ (completion) of the wrath which began with the trumpets.3) We don’t have to be outta here for the bowls (the first 6 anyway) because these are specifically directed at the beast and his kingdom (possibly one of the reasons if not THE reason why the armies gather to fight against Jesus in time for his 1,260th day return)Joe, the book of Revelation was written in 90 AD so all the vision therein were seen at that time. This statement is not meant to be heard when the events occur but when the words are read. This is just one of many reminders in Revelation that Jesus is coming.Curt…don’t try to deflect a man with genuine revelation (just as I had 4 years ago on this self same thing when it all instantly fell into place and I suddenly realised, initially in horror, the big fat lie that pre-trib is)….as I’ve said before …I agree that this is meant for readers…….as an indicator that we need to be ready for Jesus to come after the 6th bowl (as one who might possibly be around at that time! – remember Daniels ‘week’ might begin any year now and it is only 7 years so that’s quite possible)……….bear in mind that some people who survive ’til the end probably know the book of Revelation and please remember also that a blessing is promised to those who read and keep the words of the book – I believe one major aspect of that blessing will be KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT SO THAT WE RESPOND APPROPRIATELY AS WE WATCH THE EVENTS UNFOLD !Kev, I agree 100% with that statement.  This is a place for Christians to come ask questions, get factual answers and pray to God that the person answering the questions do so with humility.  That’s what our loving God would expect from a believer that is trying to enlighten his brother in Christ.Unfortunately people often think every time they see the words gathering , harvest , reaping harvest they think it refers to the rapture , . These verses in Rev 14 are definitely not a rapture , just look at what happens to those who are harvested during this time period
19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.It is by order of God Almighty  that they be thrown into the winepress and are killed
 Those in this harvest are not the people of God but are the enemies of GodThe rapture is the harvest that immediately precedes the grape harvest in Ch 14 (there are TWO distinct harvests here)14 I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man[b] with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, ‘Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.’ 16 So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.Q. Why might a pre-trib teacher who knows full well (either from the outset or since part way through their ministry) that pre-trib is wrong continue to teach it any way ?A. Profit, popularity and acceptance within the church club at large are certainly amongst the possible reasons but one other occurred to me:Imagine if you will for a moment a parent who knows that the world is a bad place and wants to protect them from all the hard knocks of life and so keeps that knowledge from them. Say then that that child is then forced through circumstances, for whatever reason, to make their own way in the world. Imagine then how all but the strong minded would crumble in such a scenario and be completely ill prepared to handle themselves in the difficulties that follow. That parent at the time GENUINELY thinks they are acting in the child’s best interests but of course most of us will know that’s not the case………..…..I know….I was that child…..Thank you very much,this is very life changing,i actually have a revelation about the end time ,that was why i decided to check up this site.And now with all this content available to me ,i have an understanding more about rapture.GOOD for you, b/c the glorious appearing of JESUS in the clouds w/ his angles, and the rapture of the saints and the 1st resurrection of the saved dead are ALL ONE BIG event. See Rev. 11:15-19, that is when He will appear, open graves, judge the dead and even the Ark of the Covenant will be seen at that time.Sorry about the typo, was supposed to be Angels…Is the rapture before the great tribulation?The rapture happens immediately after the tribulation (Matthew 24:29-31).Here’s a novel idea…
Quit arguing over when Jesus will return and focus on  what Jesus wants  to do through us:  REACH people who don’t know Him.  Disciple them so they can reach others. I know this is not nearly as comfortable as debating your theories but  at the end of the day…NOBODY KNOWS WHEN JESUS IS RETURNING!  PERIOD…
Bless ya!Where is the wisest place to live at a time like this?
My guess would be Jerusalem where we, Christians might do the most good…”to the Jews first” … And be safest, ourselves, while
we await the time of THE LORD’S HARVEST??BUT relocating so far away would be a much easier venture if
There were someone I knew on the other end!Please advise, I’ve always wanted to live in the Holy City, or thereabouts,
You are a wise man, please advise ?? & please know that I shall always stand together with you
On ISRAEL’S behalf.I only wish I could do more!A “trump”is different from a “trumpet”
From 1cor15:52, the “last trump” not “last trumpet” means  the last sound to come out of a trumpet , not that it is the last trumpet. Do not read the bible like an illiterate.  The rapture occurs at the end of the sixth seal not the seventh trumpet of the 7th seal.
Also in rev 14 :14 the son of man had a sickle for harvest which is the rapture, but the angel of verse 17 also had another sickle which is not for the rapture but for the winepress (144000jews to be saved during the great tribulation) who die as martyrs for rejecting the Antichrist number. The “great tribulation” of matt24:21 has never occured before in history, and is different from the ordinary “tribulation” of verse 29.
Pay attention to every word in the bible and do not confuse “tribulation” with the “great tribulation”
Stay wise and enlightened.Check the Greek. Same word used for every time the word Trumpet is cited. U can try to make a distinction but the Greek does not, only the translator did.Gabriel , I d like you to show me where you get the idea verse Matt 24:21 and 24:29 are talking of two different tribulations or two different times for that matter?? Can you tell me what an ordinary tribulation looks like? Jesus said in verse 29 after the tribulation of those days ( referring to verse 21 ) the sun will be darkened etc. before you start scolding others you might consider a large dose of humility, and also consider what James said: in James 3:1 not many of you should become teachers ( self constituted censors and rep rovers of others ) my brethren , for you know that we teachers will be judged by a higher standard and with a greater severity thus we assume a greater accountability and the more condemnation .Revelation 11:15-19 tells us that JESUS does appear at this time. It’s AT the 7th trumpet b/c it tells us that its time to open the graves, and judge the people, plus the ark of the covenant will be seen at that time. I even have a bible that has the title right above where it says 7th trumpet, it say the return of JESUS. This will be his appearing, it’s the same as the rapture and the 1st resurrection of the dead (who were saved).Yes exactlyOnly the pure christians will go who are daily washed in the blood of the lamb. The remaining christians u see in the trib are those who had one sin or the other before Jesus came. They will totally repent and follow holiness after the rapture takes place and they are left behind.Matthew your doctrine is wrong !! That is not what it says in Matthew 24 or Daniel 12 or revelation 6 or 7 or 11 . Revelation 6 when John was asked who are all these in the white robes ? He was told they were those who came out of the great tribulation , Daniel 12 only speaks of two kinds of people those who become more wicked and those who purify themselves . What would the purpose be of the trib if it was for the wicked ? Why would Jesus ,John Mathew, etc be warning the church of the trib? It is quite obvious the heathen and ungodly could care less. Might I also add , how many so called pure Christians do you know? Walking according to Jesus teaching Matt 5:48 be yee therefore perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect . You’ve got the same lame doctrine taught by 95% of the evangelical community that you are somehow deserving of rapture .God did not spare the apostles or prophets, were they pure ? Wake up Jesus said he who endures to the end would be saved , he also said , if any man come after me let him take up his cross and follow me . Was Jesus just kidding ? if you are too reign with Christ you must give up your life and also suffer with Christ can you show me where Jesus said his followers wouldn’t be persecuted? Killed , beaten turned over for death ??? You have no understanding whatsoever ! Grace is not entitlement , grace is the understanding you don’t deserve mercy, and God has given you everything needed to overcome a sinful life. Grace leads to repentance , repentance leads to Rightousness , Rightousness leads to holiness and holiness leads to God ! If you were really purchased with the blood of Christ who says what your destiny is you ? You really need a better prayer life and get filled with the Holy SpiritCorrection it was revelation 7 :13-14where John was asked who are those in the white robes revelation 6:11 that I mentioned speaks of those in the festive white robes worshippers patiently waiting for those yet to be slain for their testimonyThose who will go through the Tribulation in the end times, their belief on the timing of the rapture and resurrection will matter to their salvation.The deception is so great that even the elect will be deceived.Taking the mark of the beast is irreversible. Our resistance to the mark of the beast is the test of our faith in Jesus Christ.Faith without manifested in works is dead.eaglet: Do you no how to avoid the mark of the beast? Are you sure you will be gone before the mark comes?We are all caught up at the last trump. The church and the real hebrews will be in it together. The church, whether there be real bloodline hebrews in it or not, will still be the church. The believing hebrews of those days who are not presently part of the church will receive an unction (so will the church) and we will be literally seeing the book of Revelation come to life like a newspaper. Thats why Hebrews through Revelation you find doctrine that is faith and works, purged from old sins, confessing sins, prayer of faith to heal the sick, etc. Today we are forgiven ALL TRESPASSES, are being justified freely by grace through faith without the deeds of the law, have all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.. Go to thescripturesalonebibleschool.netI am currently pregnant and have a toddler. I have accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and savior. We are raising our children under Christ. So I wonder this, is it possible to survive tribulations to be here for the rapture? I would gladly give my children to Christ but the thought of them suffering during tribulations makes me ill.Can someone please help me. I’m very confused about the Rapture and the Apocalypse. Meaning what has happened vs what’s to come.Like Erwin Baxter, I was curious about all this
‘End Time’, Biblical Prophecy stuff. Circa 1985 in Lemoore, Ca, I completed my own scriptural study. I concluded: 1. There would be no pre-tribulation rapture. 2. A worldwide mass martyrdom of saints would take place under Satan’s ‘Nazi World’, ie., The New World Order/Revived Rome. Born-again Christian believers who did not accept the micro chip implant (666 Mark Of The Beast) would be beheaded by guillotine in stadiums full of cheering marked unbelievers. Out of the blue the Holy Ghost ‘dumped’ my wife and her mother with identical words of wisdom at a Christian gathering at our condominium in Lemoore! Both saw the same stadium, cheering, marked, unbelievers, believer beheadings by guillotine, etc.! It was confirmation my study was correct!With all due respect, the Word of God is not subject to your study. It’s plainly written in Revelation. The rapture comes first then Armageddon. I do agree that the body of Christ will suffer Bernie the Rapture but suffering for Christ is not the same thing at the Tribulation. The Tribulation begins when Daniel 9:27 occurs. We will be gone before thatWhere is the wisest place to live at a time like this?

On ISRAEL’S behalf.I only wish I could do more!Jesus has a perfect place for us all….unless we are directed to move we may already be in that place. only there can we be used most efficient as we continue to grow in our relationship with Him and not be moved by earthly situations but only giving God praiseI believe the rapture (hapazo) of the church is pre-tribulation. Jesus Himself likened His coming to that of the days of Noah and also the days of Lot. In the former, Noah and family were ‘raptured’ into the spiritually door locked ark A WEEK BEFORE the global watery (tribulation) wrath deluge was poured on the Earth to wipe out the nephilims. Similarly, in the days of Lot, Lot and his daughters were ‘raptured’ out of Sodom by God’s angels JUST BEFORE God’s fiery wrath of hail and fire rained on the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha. The ‘beginning of the end’ comes after the gospel of Jesus Christ is preached to all humanity (that one is without excuse of ignorance) before the terrible day of the Lord begins. Furthermore, the Holy Spirit alone (without sweat) is holding back the sum total of Satan’s myriads of entities (falling entities; demonic creatures and all manner of nephilim satanic super soldiers) from bursting out forth and unleashing unparalleled wickedness and chaos, just for the elects’ (biblical christians’) sake. This shows how precious we are to God! Protecting us from the chaos. Will He now remove His restraining hand, allowing the enemy to torment His bride, that His initial restraining be in vain? Nay! The ‘tribulation Christians’ are those who ‘repented too late’ after the rapture, (many by reason of fear of what is to come, as well as repenting unto Christ as the great tribulation heats up like never before or after. Shalom…Ameola,
I was once pre-trib but the more scripture I read  I can see how it could be. When I read in 2 Thess. 2:1-3 it specifically says not to let anyone deceive you that the gathering together with The Lord will not happen until the apostasy happens first and the man of lawlessness is revealed. As far as the restrainer there are many options but it does not say distinctly. I know the Holy Spirit by scripture will not be removed and some believe it’s the church who restrains but that can’t be possible either because in scripture it’s says he is taken out of the way and the bride is referred to in feminine form. EPHES 5:25 explains the bride as feminine form.  As for Lot and Noah, they were there but protected from the wrath of God. We as believers are not appointed for the wrath of God but I believe we will go through judgement and be refined because the church has been complacent.
1 Peter 4:16-19 but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name. For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will become of the godless man and the sinner? Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right. Also in Matthew 24:21 describes great distress unequaled from the beginning of the world until now and never to be equaled again.  Then in Matthew 24:29 It explains IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DISTRESS OF THOSE DAYS the sign of the sign of man in heaven, and the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and glory, and he will send his angel to gather his elect. There are so many scriptures saying what we will go through for our faith, and those who endure to the end will be saved. Scripture tell us we will be refined because none of us our worthy without spot or blemish.  As for me personally I believe we will go before God pours out His wrath but not before, God BlessAdemola sorry for the miss spelling of your nameYES, it’s a PRE-WRATH rapture of the church. Happens at the 7th trumpet Rev.11:15-19. The church IS NOT appointed to the wrath of GOD, therefore we will be removed just slightly prior to that, at the last trumpet, which precedes the first bowl/vial judgment (plague).
JESUS will appear in the clouds for His saints. He will come w/angels, and the dead will be called “UP” from out of their graves where they were not aware of anything (as they were sleeping).
The ones alive will also “rise up” and meet the LORD JESUS in the air just after the ones who came out of the graves.
They will ALL go to be with JESUS. Then the last set of 7 judgments will fall onto the earth and they will fall ONLY on the unrepentant sinners who they are designed for.
Good that you’ve understood and done your homework. You have studies the word and you get it. The truth will make you free. The 1st resurrection of the saints, the glorious appearing of JESUS and the Rapture are all one big event, happening at the same time.Amen Wandakate. If we study all applicable scripture, in context, we find a harmonious thread of truth that is unmistakable – a pre-wrath rapture coincident with the glorious return of Yeshua at the 7th trumpet. The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture requires ignoring several scriptures, misunderstanding others, and separating verses or even parts of verses from their context. And I believe it does matter what we believe about the resurrection (rapture) and its timing, or else He and Daniel and Paul and John would not have been inspired to reveal the truth so we can be prepared. Someone earlier commented on the danger of believing we won’t be persecuted in the tribulation – we may not be prepared to go through the hardships that may await us. Thanks to brother Baxter for a clear and scriptural explanation.Thank you for this post.  I always figured the rapture will occur when the Two Witnesses are resurrected and called up to Heaven.  I beieve the RAPTURE is reverse of PENTACOST.
The born again Christian is filled with the INDWELLING HOLY SPIRIT.  When the Trumpet sounds it will be a call for the HOLY SPIRIT to return to Heaven.  God is calling Him back.  When the Spirit leaves the earth He will take his HOUSE with HIM.  He promised to never leave His temple.  I don’t believe the world will hear the trumpet call – it will be for THE SPIRIT ONLY.  Immediately after this an earth quake occurs and the person caught up in the Rapture will not be missed thinking they were swallowed by the earthquake.  Without the restraint of the Holy Spirit this planet will be consumed by sin.Unfortunately the bible doesn’t support a pre-tribulation rapture. JESUS will have his glorious appearing at the 7th trumpet and NOT before. That is in Revelation 11:15-19. Remember the bible told us it would be in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye at the “last trumpet”.
We’re still here for the seal and trumpet judgments, and they are the wrath of satan, b/c he hates Christians. The bible says that the antichrist comes to make “WAR” with the “saints”, and they are GOD’s people. They had not left the earth when the antichrist was here. They were persecuted for their faith.     The seals and trumpets are the “tribulation”, but the “great tribulation” will be the final 7 trumpets (plagues) and that is the “wrath” of GOD, on all the unrepentant sinners. The church “is not” appointed to the “wrath of GOD”, therefore they won’t be poured out until the end “after” the 7 trumpets have been released by the 7th angel.
So, a pre-trib stand is NOT biblical, has no biblical support to it whatsoever. It has NO foundation. It’s a false doctrine to keep people happy. It’s just a part of the “feel good” gospel, and yes, it’s very popular, but it’s not the TRUTH of the word. Maybe you should start reading more and studying what it’s really telling you.Read Revelation again and believe it as it is written. The Church is gone after chapter 3 and not mentioned until Chapter 19.Thank you for sharing your God-given encouragement about the pre-tribulation events and Jesus Christ’s saving grace from the horrible events after His rapture of the Church of True Believers.  I’m just PraisingGODfor Jesus is coming for me.True Word.  You’re so correct. The church of Philadelphia is the raptures church that will not see the hour of temptation. But  Israelites will experience God’s wine press (great tribulation) and only 144000 of them will be saved because it has been appointed to them .Why do people comment on this page if they are short tempered?As we all realize the timing isn’t a salvation issue if believers are firm in The Lord even to point of death but if many are taught they will be taken out of everything and not have to endure persecution or maybe even death will they be strong enough to endure or will they blame the pre trib church  and turn from God for not explaining what could happen?Could this be a part of the falling away, the apostasy?YES, exactly. The church isn’t going anywhere, they just think they are b/c they have been deceived and aren’t aware that has happened.
Two things MUST happen before JESUS comes, and scripture tells us, The man of sin (the antichrist) MUST come first, and the great falling away of the church (apostasy) MUST also happen “before” JESUS appears.
SO, the truth is, the antichrist will come, along with the mark and when people find out they were so deceived (lied to – led astray) they will fall out of the churches by the groves…That is why b/c they thought they would be gone, escape, be raptured!
Christians need to “wake up” and study their bibles and pray for wisdom to discern the signs of the times. We were told to watch, pray, be aware, awake, and alert to the signs of the times.
Nobody’s going anywhere until the 7th trumpet…Revelation 11:15-19.Why is the Church never mentioned after chapter 3 in Revelation? Our function, what we will do, or anything? The Church of Philadelphia being kept from that hour of testing that is about to come upon the whole world to test those who dwell upon the earth. They were the only Church that He was pleased with. Do people not want to consider the pre-trib thing because it means they have to live a daily pure life style instead of living loose waiting upon endtime signs? The Angel asked John who are those in white robes standing before the throne, and John said you tell me. The Angel said these are the who came out of the great tribulation who have washed their robes white in the blood of the lamb? I thought a real Christian has already done that. If all Christians are raptured at the very end, who populates the millennial kingdom because Christian’s bodies are changed in a twinkling of an eye, and they are having babies in the kingdom. Why would Christ put his Church through the tribulation when they have served him already? Paul says Jesus comes on the clouds and gathers the dead in Christ first, and we who are alive are caught up together with them. He doesn’t say His angels gathers us. It’s very confusing.Todd you have asked the question that leads to so much misunderstanding about the rapture. First the letters to the 7 churches were letters addressed to those specific 7 churches. These letters are for the entire church to read and understand. The word “church” is seen after chapter 3 in chapter 22 where Jesus says He has sent His angel to testify these things to the churches (all churches). Now after chapter 3 Jesus speaks to the entire church by referring to them as “Saints”. Saints in the NT is always believers and so saints = believers = church and so the church is clearly shown (some 13 times) after chapter 3. Keep studying and asking questions. You will overcome the confusion and see clearly if you keep at it.The book of Revelation is NOT strictly in chronological order!
JESUS appears at the “last trumpet”. Read Revelation 11:15-19. What did you read? JESUS takes over possession of this evil world right then from satan, who is currently the “god” of this world and the graves open, the Ark of the Covenant is seen at that time. That is the 1st resurrection of the saints, that is the glorious appearing of JESUS, and it’s also the rapture. ALL 3 of these are at the same time, at the 7th trumpet.
The tribulation is the wrath of satan (seal and trumpet) judgments/plagues, however the bowl judgments/plagues are the wrath of GOD thus the great tribulation.
Since the church is NOT appointed unto the wrath of GOD, they will be removed “before” the wrath of GOD, but that’s NOT until the 7th trumpet…Therefore the church is here to suffer. There is NO escape route out. JESUS suffered, and told us that we would also suffer for His namesake. Matthew 5:1-12, what does the last one tell you?
Blessed are ye when men shall REVILE you, and PERSECUTE you and say all manner of EVIL against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your REWARD in heaven for so PERSECUTED they the prophets which were before you.
Does this sound like a secret rapture or a way out? NO, it’s the height of arrogance for any Christian to believe they will be removed prior to suffering. We will know who the antichrist is, and what the mark of the beast is, and yet not be prepared for any of it b/c we are basically deceived souls.The rapture takes place after the tribulation at the last trump, as you stated, I was glad to see that someone else has the correct understanding of this and has scripture to confirm it.I certainly believe that JESUS appears at the last trumpet (the 7th one) of Revelation. But to whom were you directing your comment?Why should the rapture happen after the Tribulation when that is when Christ comes to judge the world and set up His Millennial Kingdom? Why go up to come right back down?We are caught up “to meet” the Lord in the air at His 2nd Coming and conduct Him back to earth. The Greek word translated “to meet” is ‘Apantesin’. It is used in 3 places in the New testament. In Matt 25.6 it is used when the wise virgins go out “to meet” the bridegroom and conduct him back to the marriage.
Acts 28.15 The believers in Rome went out to Appii forum “to meet” (apantesin) Paul and conduct him back into Rome.
In 1 Thess 4:17 believers are “caught up together with them in the clouds ‘to meet’ (apantesin) the Lord in the air…”
The IVF Commentary says here Quote:
“So the Lord is pictured as ecsorted to the earth by his people – those newly raised from the dead and those who have remained alive.”
So we do go up to meet the Lord and come down again as His escorts!
The process of the leading citizens in ancient Helenistic Greek times in going out of a city for about a mile and conducting a visting dignatory back into the city was called the “Apantesis”. The Holy Spirit chose this word here in 1 Thess 4:17 to prevent the idea that the believers would be caught up to meet the Lord and then go to heaven! We are caught up to meet the Lord and we must conduct Him back to earth!
Colin CThanks for telling the truth about the rapture, it is immediately after the tribulation as Jesus told his disciples in Matthew 24:29. Jesus also said that the time was shortened so his elect, if possible could be deceived! So, he left his elect to go through the tribulation, but, he is going to rapture those liars and false TV preachers? I don’ think so! In Malachi 4:5,”Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:” So, Elijah is one of the witnesses and I believe the other is Enoch, the only two in the scripture that hasn’t died yet, but the scripture says it is appointed unto man to die once, Hebrews 9:27. the two witnesses continue for three and a half years and they are killed by the antichrist and the whole world is going to view their dead bodies for three days then they will be resurrected on the third day, we will know that the rapture is close! as Jesus said “lift up your heads your redemption is coming! Jesus also said that he will send his angels to gather his elect from the four corners of heaven and earth! Mark 13:27 So, Enoch and Elijah and his elect have to go through the tribulation, but, not the church? I don’t think so! I heard one Baptist preacher say that the church would be raptured and the Holy Ghost would be absent during the tribulation, But Jesus said to his disciples, take no thought what to say when brought before the rulers, for the Holy Ghost will speak through you, Mark 13:11. Most preachers are lying to their congregations, so most Christians are not prepared to reject the mark of the beast, and as Enoch and Elijah, stand up against the antichrist. You had better believe that the antichrist will know the scriptures! How do you think most Christians would react to the following resolution by the antichrist and the one world government?
Resolution 666-2A
Whereas: Christians or those that proclaim to follow this Jesus Christ and his Bible which previously by Resolution 666-1A was declared “hate speech”, and:
Whereas: these same Christians have failed to perform Matthew 19:21,”Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasures in heaven: and come and follow me.” and:
Whereas: we want those Christians to be perfect and to have treasures in heaven: and
Be it here resolved: effective immediately, that all Christians must publicly denounce this Jesus Christ and publicly burn their Bibles and receive my mark in their right hand or their forehead in order to keep any assets, including but not limited to the following, lands, houses, cars, retirement accounts, bank accounts, businesses, gold, silver, art, tools, seeds ,guns, ammo, and any and all other assets: And:
Also be it here resolved: to Christians that refuse to deny this Jesus Christ and worship me, all the assets listed above shall be seized for the good of the collective, the one world government.
Yes, we will need each other to endure to the end, to be saved! Matthew 24:13The Rapture happens before the Tribulation. The Church is not mentioned in Revelation from chapter 3 on until chapter 19. We are not going to go though Jacob’s trouble. That’s for the nonbelieving Jews and the Gentiles. In chapter 4 of Revelation, John is called up into Heaven to see the things that must take place. The Church is already in Heaven already. Suffering for Christ is not the same as going through the Tribulation. The days are definitely coming where it will cost us our lives to be a follower of Christ but we will be gone before Daniel 9:27 occurs. You have to compare Matthew 24 to Revelation.  The signs in Matthew 24 occur after the Rapture.Not to mention that the Holy Spirit is calling out those to be the body of Christ. Christ chose who are His before the foundation of the world. It doesn’t make sense for us to go though the Tribulation. Why would God call out a body and punish it with the Tribulation. Please don’t forget about predestination, read Ephesians 1. Again, read Revelation  the Church isn’t mentioned after chapter 3 until chapter 19. Christ already knows that that are His. There is no need to prove it. Those that call themselves Christians and are not born again are not true Christians. Good knows the difference. Study Revelation, everything is laid out in Chronological order.The arrogance of Christians in these United States and their belief that Christians will not be tested. Our brothers and sisters all around the world are already in tribulation and are being beheaded for their testimony. Wake up, please I pray. There is no free elevator ride. We will be tested in the tribulation for the perfecting of our Faith. We will not take part in GOD’s wrath but many will be killed for not accepting the mark. Why do think the scriptures tell what is going to happen? The ungodly unsaved do not read Revelation. We who are in the light must open our hearts  with the Word and test every message from the pulpit against the Scriptures.The edification. Lord knows we all need it!Revelation is NOT in chronological order.  John had many visions, not just one long one.  Even events within a single vision are not necessarily in chronological order.
The whole “church is not mentioned between chapters 13 and 19” teaching is laughable because it is mentioned in 19 and 20 which documents the major end time events in chronological order.  Yes, the church is in the tribulation.  Read it yourself, not what someone else wants you to believe.Those are the tribulation saints not the Bride of Christ to different sets of believers in two different dispensations .
Even John who would definitely recognize the Bride said who are these coming in . He did not recognize them at all.
Also in revelations John saw the open door and the 24 elders is represent the church. They are already there.
That’s what starts the tribulation it can’t start til we depart .Ten virgins represent those that had oil in there lamps ” the Holy Spirit “and the other 5 that did not . The ones that do are the Jews and Gentiles that have been sealed with the Holy Spirit , that put there faith in Christ . They will go and meet the Groom . The others are Jews and Gentiles that rejected so great a salvation ,left behind to go thru the trib. Gods wrath for rejecting his beloved Son Jesus . Brothers and Sisters  this is the time of Awesome Grace . The Catching Away is not a new concept but scripturally sound and a blessed hope for those that are in Christ . Today is the day of salvation …..
You may not have a tomorrow.
The lawless one ( the antichrist ) can not be revealed until first the Restrainer is taken out of the way .
Who is the Restrainer ? The Holy Spirit ! Where does the Holy Spirit dwell ? In the Believer !!! God is restraining darkness thru light of his Beloved Bride .
Who is the temple of the Holy Spirit , Our body’s the church body – the Gentiles have had the privilege of spreading the gospel in this dispensation . It pivots back to The Jews during the tribulation . They will realize they missed the Messiah , they will build a physical building temple . The AntiChrist will sit in it , it’s call the abomination of desolation .
144,000 Jews will be sealed to preach the gospel it will be powerful in a short time.We are in the time of grace -dispensations is the church age . The bride of Christ will be raptured out prior to the first four riders in revelation the church is not mentioned again after chapter 4 . The tribulation saints will be worn out and die for their faith most beheaded . John even asked who are these that where coming in they couldn’t not be numbered he new who the bride is and it was there that’s why he’s asking who are these -It will be Gentiles , Jews and people from every tongue and nation , there’s your proof . It’s pre- tribulation the Lord will come like a thief in the night , and in the twinkling of a eye which is seconds we will be changed . Now why would he say a thief if it was at mid or post trib . Which 3 1/2 years or 7 years is easily counted , but we have been waiting for thousands of years for the catching away , we know this here is the generation because of Jesus parable about the fig tree , which told of Israel becoming a nation again 1948 , he said that would be the generation that would see his return .
As much as the Lord Jesus loves his bride do you honestly think he would put her thru the wrath of God , remember the wrath of God is basically a last call to the lost world and punishment for rejecting his wonderful saving grace – That’s not the Bride.
If you look in Thessalonians – The lawless one can Not be revealed until first the Restrainer is taken out of the way . Who is the Restrainer ? The Holy Spirit !!! Where does the Holy Spirit dwell ? In the believer . We are straining evil . We are the lights in the darkness . when you become a born again believer you are sealed until the day of redemption . You can not be lost again or snatched out of his hands . No where in the bible did anyone get saved twice . Otherwise you would be saying that Christs work on the cross was not able to save you and keep you saved .
As a guarantee he deposited his spirit in you and gave you a new heart . The scriptures are clear on this . Jesus righteousness was added to your account . Not guilty . When God looks upon you he sees you washed in Jesus blood and white as snow . Don’t for get the scripture ” there is no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus ” and what does the scriptures say about those that reject Christ they are condemned already ,the bible says you are a work in progress . It’s his grace that saves you and the same grace will keep you all the way home . He paid for past, present and future sins . He paid it in full , not a partial forgiveness . Your name was written down in the Lambs book of life at the moment of salvation .
The great falling away is churches infiltrated with false teachers it’s already happening and they are starting to return to the harlot . Her colors are linen , Purple , and red , according to revelations and this is and will be the false church , a one world church . A wolf in sheeps clothing. It would deceive Gods elect ( the tribulation saints ) if that where possible . Which it’s not !!!
Blessings Beloveds just a little while longer .
Exciting times !!I would sincerely like to be thankful to you for your teachingsMatthew 16;18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall NOT prevail against it. Revelation 13; 7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to OVERCOME them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. Daniel 7;21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and PREVAILED against them;  On the basis of a post trib or mid trib rapture, which one of the above scriptures is wrong? Revelation 2 ; 18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, 22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. And please explain what this scripture would be doing in the bible if the whole church were to here for ANY part of the 7 years of Jacob’s trouble? The 1st 69 weeks were for the Hebrews and Jerusalem , however does the church get fitted into the 70th week?    Revelation 2 22 . Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, EXCEPT they repent of their deeds. Jesus said HE will cast those who refuse to repent into Great Tribulation, EXCEPT they repent. Jesus knew an event (the departure) was coming before “The Great Tribulation” or HE would not not have used the conjunction word EXCEPT. And Daniel 7-21  I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; the beast can not prevail against the church . PRE; 7 years time of Jacob’s trouble; rapture;I see no mention of the torah here.  You have to study the Old Testament in order to understand the new.  There are many types and shadows there to bring understanding to the New Testament.  There is a book, “Israel and the Church, Two Voices for the Same God” which is excellent.  They are the two witnesses in one respect.  Many scriptures have more than one meaning.  The book can be purchased on Amazon and the author is Jacques Doukhan.  It is our duty to watch, pray, and support Israel.  Many Christians have become distracted by hoarding, not giving, and arguing about the timing of the “rapture”.  Joseph is a picture of Christ and the gentiles were removed before he revealed himself to his brothers on their second trip to Egypt.  We need to draw near to The Lord and pray about what ministries we are to support as the times are very deceptive.  As for when he comes, we will find out when He decides.  The orthodox community is crying out for the Messiah to come every day.  The Church is praying for peace and spreading the gospel.  There will always be disagreements about the timing but don’t let it distract you from your individual call.  The author has two other books on Amazon which are excellent-Daniel and Revelation viewed through the eyes of a Jewish Exile.  The interesting thing is that the Torah has the answers for the New Testament and the New Testament has the answers for the Torah.  Study to show yourself approved and Blessed is the one who is working when The Lord returns.Rev. Baxter my pastor Fred kinzie pastor of first Apostolic church Toledo Ohio taught a pretrib rapture I think you new him what a teacher of the word. Let me ask you was he teaching me wrong? He taught the church will be taken out before the tribulation I don’t want to go into the pros and cons. But I feel your teaching is causing dis unity in the church . AveryAvery I have read over and over scriptures that speak of a post trib rapture. Jesus clearly taught it. I onced believe in the pre-trib rapture until I studied for myself. God commands use to be good students of the bible 2 Tim 2:15 ” Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” There is so much bad doctrine out there coming from churches you won’t believe. The teachers will be held to a higher standard for what they are teaching. Read the bible as if you have never heard of a rapture and you will come to the conclusion of a post trib caught-up.
MiltonThe PRE-TRIB rapture is a part of the “feel good gospel”, and it is NOT Rev. 11:15-19 and that’s when JESUS will appear, that is the rapture of the church, and the first resurrection all wrapped up into one event, a Three in One glimpse of His glory…It’s a PRE-WRATH rapture, meaning that JESUS will appear just prior to the “wrath” of GOD being poured out onto mankind and ALL the sinners.Sorry for leaving out BIBLICAL…The pre-trib rapture is a part of the “feel good gospel, and it is NOT BIBLICAL!!! Please read Rev: 15-19…Only when people quit listening to the preachers and start studying for themselves, will they find truth.  Baxter is right about the catching away is at the end of the Trib.  That is when Yahweh returns to wipe out the armies that came against Jerusalem.  That is when He collects the Elect before wiping out those armies and every other person left on this earth after He collects those who are His.  Then He burns those left all up.  Then He brings the Elect right back to this earth for the Millennial Kingdom, no one goes to heaven like preachers teach.  Scriptures teach the contrary.  There are two lakes of fire not one.Are we the generation that will see Jesus come back?JESUS (YESHUA) told us to “watch” for the signs of the times. It wasn’t the day or the hour that was important, but the signs that we would see. Look around and notice what’s going on in the world, and how people are changing rapidly…Read Rev. 11:15-19 and that is when JESUS will appear, at the 7th trumpet…Yes this is that generation according to the parable of the fig tree Jesus was telling when Israel becomes a nation again which was 1948 .That is the generation  “the catching away ” and then we come back with Jesus at the end of the tribulation .
It does matter that we know it’s pre trib rapture . This is a blessed hope for the bride of Christ So “this is that generation according to the parable of the fig tree”?  And how long is a Biblical generation?  Most scholars believe it to be 40 years. Sooo if you add 40 to 1948 you come up with 1988.  Well unless I missed something the Lord didn’t return or “catch away” His saints in 1988.  Something is mighty wrong with this interpretation of prophecy……It just saddens me to read how some believers don’t realize how precious you are in God’s eyes. Dont you understand who you are in Christ???  For God so loved the world He gave His ONLY BEGOTTEN SON . . .!!!    We don’t have to prove ourselves worthy by being “refined” in the tribulation period.  We already fall short of the Glory of God, Jesus now stands in our place for our salvation.  Whether it’s post or pre we will all find out soon enough. But use a different argument then the church having to be refined by the tribulation because we have “fallen away”.  I’m covered by the blood of Jesus right now and no amount of tribulation is gonna change that.   My God is greater than this world and the devil. I’ve nailed any sort of personal gain in this world to the cross and I know this body of flesh won’t last forever anyway, so bring on whatever has to happen in order for Jesus to return! !!This is the essence of our faith.  As Ivan said above it does not really matter when the rapture occurs if we are TRULY covered by the Lambs blood we are in Gods hands in Christ Jesus.  Nothing else really matters, and nothing will separate us from his love, mercy and grace forever and ever.Will i still make the rapture if i am saved but living unmarried to my fiance?Tammy,If you’re in Christ, you will not miss the rapture.  As for living “unmarried…”  Marriage, in God’s eye, is not a document that legalizes your living together.  Marriage, to God, is the “consummation” of your love and commitment to one another.  I’m guessing that since you’re living together, you’re already “married.”  God knows your heart, know His and you’ll know that He honors your commitment.Thank you and god blessWHAT? Why are you telling her this LIE? They are living in “fornication” and that is a “SIN”. Anyone reading scripture would know that they will NOT enter the coming Kingdom of GOD as long as they live that way. It may be popular and many people do that, but it’s NOT right with GOD, and will be punished.
They MUST confess, repent and forsake their sins in order to get right with GOD and then get married legally.
We don’t go to heaven by living in sin, and I would think we would have enough common sense to realize that, but apparently some don’t.Ye must turn from your sin and live a Godly live. (without fornicating).That’s between you and GOD…We can’t be the judge of your LIFE…U r…Pray and let the Holy  Spirit  lead and guide you in all truth …Amen.. judge no one …No need to seek specific guidance when the Bible is already clear on a matter.Do you think teens will be taken in the pretribulation raptureWe believe the Bible tells us that the rapture will occur “immediately after the tribulation of those days.” Therefore, we do not believe that anyone will be taken in a pre-trib rapture.Thank u..Is a PRE-WRATH rapture, NOT a pre-tribulation one. That is a “false” gospel, and it’s part of the “feel good gospel”, and has absolutely NO foundation to it, it’s NOT biblical sound. JESUS is going to “appear” and that’s going to be at the 7th trumpet (See Rev. 11:15-19) and He will take out the church (rapture them) just “prior” to the last set of judgments, the Bowl/Vial judgments which are the “wrath of GOD.” We’re going to be here until then. So NO the teenagers will not go in a pre-trib rapture, why would they? They are sinners just like anybody else. We must confess, repent and forsake our sins in order to be part of the 1st Resurrection.TYPO: That was supposed to be (IT’s a pre-wrath rapture)…sorry.That is not correct!   You are talking about the middle tribulation.  If you are Christian< God will save from that day or hours that will come upon the land……Another words,  I will be waving by to you at that time…peace!!Believe in the love and grace of God that can make all things right because its His desire that all may be saved! 1Timothy 2;4The Rapture is for all Believers (those who believe in Jesus and accepted Him as Savior), no matter what the age.I fear you are missing it along with everyone else. Forget Rapture, it is the 1st Resurrection. We are only caught up to meet the Lord in the AIR! We are not going to Heaven. Greek- aera. This is so obvious and in your face. Read Matthew 13, 24 and Acts 1 and 28. Understand apantesin and aera. Use the Bible and common sense. Jesus is returning to Earth for good, descending from Heaven. Air! Air! Air! never means heaven of any sortThe RAPTURE, the 1st RESURRECTION of the dead, and the GLORIOUS APPEARING of JESUS are “all” one event, happening at the same time at the 7th trumpet judgment.
We are according to scripture going to rise up out of the grave or on the earth (if alive at that time) and meet the LORD JESUS in the air where He’s going to be waiting with His angels.
Then it says we’ll forever be with the LORD. We will be with Him for eternity in the New Jerusalem or in the coming Kingdom of GOD.
Now, when will that be for sure? Don’t forget about the 1,000 years.
We’re not going to rise up only to just remain there in the AIR with JESUS.
He said I am going to prepare a place for you! We apparently will be going to that place in a spiritual form, as the corrupt put on the incorruptible, and the mortal will put on immortality at that time.Hi….not posted on here for a while but just thought I’d share something significant in the news today..The head of Poland’s right-wing ruling party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, would like to see the UK hold a new in-out referendum, AFP news agency reports. Mr Kaczynski said the EU would have to “radically change” in order for Britons to want to return.He called for institutional reforms that would make the EU a “superpower”. A confederation of nation states would be created, he said, under a president in charge of a powerful military “with two great fronts – the east and the south”.COMPARE WITH:DAN 8:9
Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the SOUTH AND THE EAST and towards the Beautiful Land. 10 It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.Not so far away now is it…A/C is at the door……!!Mr. Baxter, do you believe in replacement theology?No, we do not believe in replacement theology.A study of Eph 2:11-22 & Rom 9-11 should immediately expose the lie of replacement theology. If in doubt always go back to the Bible.Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God’s ELECT, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for OBEDIENCE to JESUS CHRIST and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.
1 Peter 1:1–2To all Pretribbers, understand the above scripture what it is telling us, if you think the Elect refers only to the Jews/Israel who does not believe that Jesus is the Christ.I say Mr. Baxter should rethink his view that the rapture happens after the tribulation,that the rapture occurs after a 7 year tribulation. The rapture actually occurs sometime during the 7 year tribulation, before the wrath of God. I agree that the saints will undergo tribulation but not for the whole 7 years. The saints will only undergo tribulation for part of the 7 years. The rapture occurs at the 6th seal. The 6th seal marks the beginning of the wrath of God (Rev.6:17). Since believers are not appointed to the wrath of God (1 Thess. 5:9), they are out of here at the 6th seal. Also, there is a notion I want to correct. The notion that the rapture occurs at the 7th trumpet. There is nothing that infers such in the passage. The passage talks about the kingdom of this world becoming the kingdom  of God. To me this speaks more of a coming down than going up. I love you and your  program Mr. Baxter but I’m sorry to say you’re wrong. Thank you for this medium you’ve given to people to express their thoughts. God bless you and once again thank you. Any questions or comments?Why I Believe in a Pre-Tribulational Rapture of the ChurchI.   Scriptures to be reconciled:
•	Romans 1:18; 2:5; 5:9
•	1 Corinthians 15:51-52
•	1 Thessalonians 4:15-17
•	Rev. 3:10; 4:1; 6:16-19:15II.  Arguments
A. Interestingly, the Church is mentioned nineteen times in the first three chapters of the book of Revelation and isn’t mentioned once as being on earth from Rev. 6-19!  And it’s in these chapters that the great outpouring of God’s wrath (orge, pronounced ORE-gay) is described in detail.B.  In chs. 2 and 3 we read, “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says TO THE CHURCHES”  (italics mine) repeated 7 times, while in ch. 13 we see: “If anyone has an ear, let him hear.” This is the same exact warning, but the mention of “THE CHURCH” is left out; it seems unthinkable that God would omit mention of the Church if it were still on earth going through these devastating judgments.C.  Which brings up a good point: what is the purpose for these judgments?  To judge the sins of the Church?  Or the sins of Christ-rejecting God-haters?
1.  Rom. 1:18 says, “The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness.”  This isn’t Christians!
2.  Rom. 2:5 corroborates this:  “But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.”  Christians have repented; can’t be for us!  See also Rom. 2:8.
3.  Rom. 5: 9  “Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him!”
4. Eph. 2: 3-5  “All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions–it is by grace you have been saved.”
5.  Eph. 5: 6  “Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient.”
6. 1 Thess. 1: 9f  “…For they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead–Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.”
7. 1 Thess. 5:9  “For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.”D.  The term used for “wrath” – who is it for?  It is used 10 x’s from Rev. 6:16 through Rev. 19:15 and is used to describe God’s divine displeasure and judgement against the ungodly.  For instance, in Rev. 6:15f  “Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!”  They would rather cry out to the rocks than to the God who could save them!  Cf. also Rev. 6:17; 11:18; 14:10, 19; 15:1,7; 16:1,19; 19:15. E.  The promises to keep the faithful church from ‘wrath’ (Rom. 5:9; 1 Thess. 1:9f; 5:9) and Rev. 3:10  where Jesus promises the faithful church at Philadelphia, “Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from [lit., “out of” – NOT SAFE THROUGH! Greek word is the preposition, ek: out of] the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth.”  VERY IMPORTANT!!!F. Jesus’ statements about His Second Coming:
	1.  Matthew 24: 37-39  “As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.”	2.  Luke 17: 26-30  “Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
“It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. “It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.”	3.  Let’s look at these two accounts (Gen. 6-9 and Gen. 19): in each case the godly were PHYSICALLY removed before the judgment began!  So the Church will be PHYSICALLY removed (1 Thess. 4:17) before the “wrath” or judgments of God can be poured out upon the earth.  Notice Gen. 19:16 where the angels PHYSICALLY grabbed Lot!  Notice also in Gen. 19:22 the angel says the judgment cannot begin until righteous Lot is removed!  Neither can the Lord’s judgments (Rev. 6-19) begin until the Church is PHYSICALLY removed from the earth.G.  Finally, the dialogue between God and Abraham re: Lot and the impending judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 18:16ff):
	1. First of all notice that the judgment was against their sin (Gen. 18:20); all of our sins have been atoned for, forgiven and blotted out.
	2. Abraham’s intercession (Gen. 18:23ff): notice as Abraham pleads the inference is that OF COURSE God would not destroy the righteous with the unrighteous.  Same argument can be made of Christians going through the great tribulation and many dying: where is the fairness of Christians having to go through a judgment meant for Christ-rejecting God-haters???
	3. Notice God’s response (Gen. 18:32): if there are 10 righteous people in the place, He will not send judgment!  By extension, if there are TEN CHRISTIANS ON THE EARTH, THEN GOD WILL NOT SEND HIS JUDGMENT!  So, obviously, all Christians must be removed from the earth before God’s judgment and wrath can be poured out “upon the whole earth” (Rev. 3:10).  Because the Revelation judgments are global, the Christians around the earth must be removed FIRST – before even the least of the judgments can begin! H.  Scholars who believe in a pre-Tribulational Rapture of the Church include Chuck Smith, Hal Lindsey, Dr. Tim LaHaye, Dr. Chuck Missler, Drs. Zuck and Walvoord, Dr. F.F. Bruce, Dallas Theological Seminary, Talbot Theological Seminary, all Church fathers for the first 4 centuries of the Church’s existence, Chuck Swindoll, Dr. D. James Kennedy, Dr. Charles Stanley, Dr. David Jeremiah, Dr. Michael Yusef (Atlanta, GA.), all Calvary Chapel pastors, most Baptists, most evangelicals, Dr. Charles C. Ryrie (Basic Theology), etc.Of these citations, only MAT 24:29-31 (with some calculated obfuscation) might say “after the tribulation ends” or it could say “after the tribulation begins”, thereby giving hints about timing of the Rapture.What starts the tribulation? Review REV 4:1, “After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.” Then this and that occurs after which Christ open the first seal judgment [cf. Rev. 6:1-2]  which introduces the Antichrist upon the earth.All of this means that the Antichrist cannot do his thing UNTIL the Church resides in heaven. It appears that there is no ambiguity about this.Other personal questions:Can you comment on the disposition of children, vis-a-vis the rapture? What if the parents are NOT in Christ?What of pets, i.e., dogs? Can they come along, or must they fend for themselves? For the animal that would be cruel, both physically and psychologically.Thank you.I say Mr. Baxter should rethink his view that the rapture happens after the tribulation, that the rapture occurs after a 7 year tribulation. The rapture actually occurs sometime during the 7 year tribulation, before the wrath of God. I agree that the saints will undergo tribulation but not for the whole 7 years. The saints will only undergo tribulation for part of the 7 years. The rapture occurs at the 6th seal. The 6th seal marks the beginning of the wrath of God (Rev.6:17). Since believers are not appointed to the wrath of God (1 Thess. 5:9), they are out of here at the 6th seal. Also there is a notion I want to correct. The notion that the rapture at the 7th trumpet. There’s nothing that infers such in the passage. The passage talks about the kingdom of this world become the kingdom of God. To me this speaks more of a coming down than a going up. I love you and your program Mr. Baxter but I am sorry to say you’re wrong. Thank you for this medium you’ve given to people to express their thoughts. God bless you and once again thank you. Any questions or comments?When Paul was saying the “last trump ” he was talking to the Jewish people .  How would they know of any trumpets in revelation when it wasn’t written until 40 years later ??? But they would know about the feasts and the trumpet blowing of the last trump sound during a Jewish feast . — Question I would like to ask   – why is it that Jesus says believe on him and have everlasting life, drink of his living water , and never thirst again .. All thru the NT says to believe and be baptized . And we do , so we have assurance that we will live with Jesus forever .  YET  if the Christians go thru the tribulation . In a post -trib , then  why do we have to be around when the antichrist will make people take the mark of the beast . Which will lose our salvation . I just don’t see how Jesus saves us by believing on his name. Then. Years later during. The tribulation , we have our salvation compromised .. what about the saints who came out of the graves after Jesus resurrection .  Did they have to go thru a tribulation??  Or we just happened to be living when tribulation happens ..I agree! The purpose of salvation is so Christians will not go thru the tribulation.Who said that Christians wouldn’t be going through the tribulation? The seals and all of the trumpets will be experienced by Christians, they are only exempt from going through the last 7 judgments (the Bowl judgments) which is the wrath of GOD. The rapture is Pre-Wrath, b/c it happens just prior to the last set of judgments.OK Irvine Baxter if you don’t want to be caught by the Genuine Christian Internal Revenue Service headed up by former Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter Family and Staff Members you will answer the following questions. 1. Is the Anti-Christ Abdullah the 2 who puts his Rubber Stamp of approval on Jordan. His given birth name being Anatoly Karpov. You Baxter have only two options on this question Yes or No (the same Yes or No response is required for the remaining two questions. 2. Is Benjamin Netanyahu, who is the current leader of Israel the False Messiah spoken of in Revelation. Yes or No. Honesty is a requirement in these responses. 3. The Woman Riding the Beast. Is she Jeanie Kirkpatrick, who was a foreign born queen by trade and tyrannical murderer of Christians operating under the umbrella protection of the UN and EU in America (the seat of world power in those days) and globally in the 1980s for the sole purpose of perpetuating her own legacy. Ego inflation, that is. Absolute cannibal and blood drinker. 4. If you don’t Honestly answer Yes to all three of these pertinent questions than I consider you a profiteer who rapes the American people. A used Car Sales-man in the style of you know who.Bradley Forest Lunsford

By the way I am secretly married to Karpov’s daughter who goes under the name Caroline Bicta. And we do have son. He is in his mid-twenties in the current time.I see several good informative posts here and thought to add a little more info . I have been watching Mr Baxter’s show for a while and find much good info on various topics , however I hope to see Mr Baxter rethink his view on the Harpazo and his thoughts on the USA being in the bible based on animal symbols as the same symbols represented Rome in the day when the scripture was written , but I will leave it there.  have learned there is far more scriptures that refer to the harpazo than most churches use when speaking of it . I suspect the reason there is so much misinformation on the timing of the rapture is due in part to the lack of research on the topic , many many church goers simply accept as fact whatever they hear from their local pulpit and do not do research to verify what they hear is factual as they often say “My pastor says…….” It is important to be sure what is taught matches perfectly with the Word of God. Something that many people do not do is simply ask why the Lord God tells us there will be a rapture ?, what is the purpose and intent of a rapture ? , after addressing these questions it becomes obvious to when it would happen. Just one of several scriptures that indicate why a rapture will happen
Rev 3:10  Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from(ek) the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.
Jesus speaks of a one time very specific hour of tribulation which is known as the Great TribulationWe all go through trials and tribulation , times of trouble but the Great trib is spoken of in Matthew 24.  A post trib rapture would be like If you work a 9 am to 5 pm job and need a ride to work and your ride shows up to pick you up at 5 pm , then there is no point or purpose in getting a ride to work at a time when you are to leave work to go home. The rapture serves a very distinct and important purpose which is to protect believers from the severe hardships to come during the hour of trial to test those who have rejected Jesus The Messiah  , and protect us from the Man of Sin , the Son of Perdition aka thee antichrist and the wrath of Gods testing trial of the inhabitants of the earth who have rejected Christ Jesus as savior of the world.Mattew 24 does Not teach the rapture it teaches the return of Jesus to earth to setup His Kingdom, and that starts  the 1000 year reign and when Jesus sends satan to the abyss to be bound in chains during that 1000 year time. The word Harpzo is the Greek word that Paul wrote in his letters in Thessalonians , that word Harpazo in Greek which means to be ‘snatched away by force’ , ‘caught up’, ‘to catch away’ which has the same meaning as the Greek word ‘ek’ used in Revelation 3:10 – ‘to remove from a time or place’ ,” to snatch away from a time or place’. The word rapture is the english version the the latin word of raperium, rapio , raptus used by Jerome around the year 400 when he wrote the latin catholic bible.  In a post trib view of the rapture it simply makes no sense and serves no purpose to be raptured up into the clouds to simply make a U-Turn in the air and come right back down , to say that it is to receive our glorified bodies , Jesus could simply Speak the word and make it happen while on earth discarding a need to be caught up into the clouds. Jesus spoke of going to prepare a place for us in heaven , then He will return for us to take us into heaven at a point in time in the future, His reference is regarding taking people who are alive in this present body who he comes to gather unto himself as those who have already passed on are already in His presence. When a person dies their physical body is buried in the ground , at the time of the resurrection/rapture the buried bodies of those who are already present with Jesus are caught up into the air first to be reunited with the spirit of those who are in heaven , then at a atomic second ,the smallest division of time ‘Atomus” we who are alive on earth are raptured to join Jesus in the air , then he takes us into heaven with our new glorified bodies , then the events of the revealing of the antichrist will happen and then the Great Tribulation which will occur during the last 3.5 years of the 7 year time frame known as the prophet Daniels 70th week , the final 7 years of human run government.
When the 7 years is done Jesus returns to earth with us believers who were in the rapture along with all those who have died In Christ who were already in heaven with Jesus and we will rule with Jesus as members of His rule in His Kingdom here on earth. Remember that when the antichrist comes into rule the earth he causes everyone to take the mark and no one can buy or sell anything unless they have the mark, and those who accept the mark will never be permitted into the Lord  Christ Jesus Kingdom , they forfeit any chance to be with Jesus forever and take their place in the lake of fire for accepting the mark , because accepting the mark is an allegiance to the antichrist and disobeying God and rejecting him , that is what the Lord God says . During the first half of the 7 year treaty is when the 144,000 show up as well as the 2 Witnesses as the scripture states that before the final 3.5 years Great Trib they are called up into heaven.
A very important thing to properly understand the topic is to learn all about the Jewish Feast Festivals as they are appointed by God and are extremely important. During these Festivals are important things that happen in relation to what God states , way too much detail to go into now , but recognize that during these Festivals the Trumpets are blown in a series of 3 successive blasts and the 3rd trumpet blast is known as The Last Trump, or The Last Trumpet call,  When Paul speaks of The Last Trumpet in Thessalonians it is Not the same reference to trumpet blasts in the Book of Revelation as they are speaking of different matters entirely .1 Corinthians 15: 51Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.Reading Thessalonians 4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  in regarding to when the Last Trump occurs , now in Revelation the trumpets that sound are announcements of terrible things that are happening , plagues, hailstones of fire weighing 100lbs each(meteors) and the wrath of God , there is no reference to any comfort during this time of trial that is coming on the inhabitants of the earth. Another thing to consider is
2 Thessalonians 2 in the Greek the words ‘falling away’ is actually apostasia it does not refer to the same thing as apostacy , an apostate Christian is someone who has left the faith but apostasia is similar but means departure , like many words in the English language a word may have a different meaning depending on how the context it is used in, consider the word ‘read’ for one example.  Paul is giving encouragement to those who had been told that Jesus had already come and has gone , Paul is telling them to not be discouraged and do not let anyone deceive them for Jesus will not come until there has been a departure first . It would not be an encouraging thing to say that Jesus will not return until the followers of Jesus had departed from the faith and it would be encouraging to say that Jesus would not return until the harpazo had occurred and only then the antichrist will be revealed after the harpazo has occurred.
“3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;Consider that there has been people leaving the faith for many many generations , but there is also many many more people coming to the faith in Jesus making the number of the population of believers continuing to increase in number , not reduce in it. When we meet the Lord in the air , we do not just stay in the air , nor do we make a U-turn and come right back down to earth. When our body dies the spirit goes on into heaven to be with the Lord. While we are still yet alive we cannot gain access into heaven , which is why Jesus meets us in the air , it is in the air when we get our glorified bodies which are incorruptible and sinless and then we can be allowed into heaven and Jesus takes us up into heaven from that point, to the place he has prepared for us(John 14:3) . At the end of the Great Trib we all who are in heaven will come with Jesus down to earth to rule and reign with Him in His Kingdom.  I also agree that we should not disrespect one another on differing viewpoints , but rathe be sure we are ready and obey the Lord Jesus command to love one another as he has loved usGod Bless!Good Job !!The spirit that went to Heaven is not the spirit of the man who died in Christ, but the Breathe of Life that returns to God which came from Him.Jesus commits His breathe of life to God just before He breathe his last on the cross. The same also with Stephen before he fell asleep.Adam was given a body out of the dust of the earth and it came alive when God breathe in his nostrils the breathe of life.The same principle I guess will apply to those who fell asleep and still on the grave. When Jesus will come back for them He will give them glorified bodies.To those who died not in Christ will be in Hades, the place for the dead, in the outer darkness, were there are weeping and gnashing of teeth. It is not Hell because it is dark in there. Hell is bright because of the Fiery condition of the place.
It may also be a prison were Jesus visited after He died on the Cross to minister to them, preparing them and warning them for their resurrection at the end of the millennium to face the white throne judgement.John 3:13:NO ONE HAS EVER GONE TO HEAVEN EXCEPT THE ONE WHO CAME FROM HEAVEN —- THE SON OF MAN Rev. 20:5(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) Where then is Enoch, Elijah, Stephen, Lazarus, and the Rich Man had gone?Some people might say that God is behind the seals. That view is not correct. Why? The fifth seal. The souls under the altar call for judgement. lt’s judgement that is needed. God would know this. So if you think the seals are the judgements of God, think again. It’s judgement that is needed. Since we are told what happens during the seals only, we can safely say that the time frame referred to in the 5th seal is during the seals. God agrees with the souls too. Any questions or comments?Pastor Baxter, I have a problem with your rapture event. if as you say the Rapture can only be at the end of tribulation, my problem is that you will know the day and hour this will take place(which the Bible states that we will not know). because the peace treaty will have been signed 2,520 earlier. the day this is signed we will know that in 2,520 days the Rapture should take place?John 14
2 In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.This is a place for the church. Those who died and are resurrected and those who are alive and also changed into immortals. Well, thank the Lord for this and it will not ever be too soon. At this place prepared we won’t have to face the tribulation of those days.This doesn’t happen until the 7th trumpet. Rev. 11:15-19 tells us that JESUS appears, He immediately takes possession of this evil world away from satan (the god of this world). The people will be judged, the graves will open at that time, and the Ark of the Covenant will even be seen.
The rapture is Pre-wrath. Happens just prior to the wrath of GOD which is the last 7 Bowl judgments/plagues.Yes you are right. The rapture is pre-wrath and note! Post TRIBULATION! and the sign of the rapture as SAID BY Jesus Christ himself in books of Matt 24:29-31, Mark13:24-27. Please read these books and also in revelations with confirm the verse Some people might say that God is behind the seals. That view is not correct. Why? The fifth seal. The souls under the altar call for judgement. It’s judgement that is needed. God would know this. So if you think the seals are the judgements of God, think again. It’s judgement that is needed. Since we are told what happens during the seals only, we can safely say that the time frame referred to in the 5th seal is during the seals. God agrees with the souls too. Any questions or comments?The entire book of Revelation is not written in strictly chronological order. According to Irvin all of the seals and trumpets up to the 6th one have already happened in the history of the world.
We are ready now for the start of WWIII.
JESUS appears in the clouds at the 7th trumpet for all to see and raises the dead at that time. ALL of the souls that ever died are in their graves waiting the resurrection. The 1st resurrection, the rapture and the glorious appearing of JESUS CHRIST is ALL one event. Rev. 11:15-19…JESUS appears and takes possession of this world away from satan at this time, the graves will open and the people will be judged, the Ark of the Covenant will even be seen at that time.Miss Wandakate – very well said and I always enjoy seeing what you write. You are doing what Jesus disciples said to do in the following scriptures :
Paul said in 2 Timothy 3:16, “All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.”
1 Peter 3:15, “Be ready to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason for the hope that is in you.”
Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:2, “Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long suffering and doctrine.” That last phrase means to do it in a
kind way.
Paul said in 2 Timothy 2:15, “Study to show thyself approved of God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightfully dividing the word of God.”
Paul also said in Romans 10:15, “How beautiful are the feet of those that bring good news.” Which means the Gospel and eternal salvation that is in Jesus Christ and what He and
His disciples said to do.
Daniel 11:32-33, “…..but the people who know their God will display strength and take action. (33) Those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many.”
Daniel 12:3, “Those who have knowledge will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.”
Jesus said in Matthew 9:27, “The harvest is truly plentiful, but the laborers are few.” Also Luke 10:2.
He also said in John 10:27, “My Sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.”
Dave SchellerAppreciate the nice comment, and I always enjoy getting the word out. JESUS said that when we know the truth, the truth will set us free.
I now have out my first 4 manuscripts which were combined into 2 real book (manuals), and if you would like copies of them, let me know. I will get you my e-mail address for info on them, thanks again.To all who might be having visions, I have been seeing the coming of Jesus Christ in the Clouds as He so marvelously predicted. I see it everyday now like movie being played in my mind. I see the Glory of Him coming through a giant circular cloud of Glory that I cannot even describe. So I’ll try. I see Jesus Christ in a White robe His face is unlike any painted portraits you may have seen over the years in art history books. His arms and hands stretched out wide; the hole in His hands and Feet a can be seen as well. With that I hear the Angels singing songs with His arrival. I see Angels behind Him and all around Him. I can see thousands of people being lifted away; their arms stretched upwards toward Jesus. I have seen the dead walking out of their graves as if I were there also in robes and lifted off the ground into the sky towards Him. I see it everyday now. I ask the Lord, “Why me?” And He smiles at me as if I’m standing right in front of Him. I fee His presence all The TIME. Next to me in the car, in my house, wherever I go I feel His presence and He is the MOST LOVING KING OF KINGS. He speaks to me sometimes and I always pray for discernment that it is Him and not a fraud. I have been a Christian for over 40 years and in the last 3 years Jesus has healed through me. A gift a take very, VERY, SERIOUSLY!!!!
So there it is my Brothers and Sisters I Christ Jesus. I am so blessed by Him my words aren’t enough to thank Him for THE GIFTS He has Blessed me with. If you have any of have any questions you please feel free to text me at stevenkatmn@me.com or Steven Maniaci on FaceBook. If be happy to share all I can with you. One last thing, and my friends this is the most important thing and that is I am completely humbled by this experience. If Paul considered himself less than the least in Heaven, than I  less than Paul. Only with humility of which, words cannot describe, do I have this humility. I boast for nothing more than the exaltation and Glory of God The Father, Jesus Christ, and The Holy Spirit.there is no such thing as the rapture or the tribulation.  there is, however, a second coming and daniel’s 70th week.  it is in the middle of this 70th week that the abomination of desolation happens, which also happens to give rise to the return of the KING.  this is all happening during the days of the voice of the seventh angel and is the mystery Paul spoke of in corinthians.  chapter 10 in revelation sets up chapter 11 which is the end of the church age and the beginning of the Day of the Lord.  irvin is a little bit daffy when it comes to common sense end time scenarios, especially when he’s trying to tell people that the first five trumpets have sounded.  be careful not to fall into the same trap he didI believe in a view that is my own, which I call Post-Post Trib.With all due respect, what on this earth is post-post trib.
The rapture happens at the sounding of the 7th trumpet. It’s before the “wrath” of GOD, which will be the Bowl Judgments. It’s a pre-wrath rapture b/c it’s going to happen just before GOD’s wrath is poured out upon all of the unrepentant sinners, not after, and the pre-trip gospel is nothing more than speculation. It’s a false hope gospel, part of the “feel good” gospel but there isn’t any TRUTH to it.
Did you read Revelation 11:15-19? JESUS appears there (the glorious appearing), the graves open, the people will be judged, the Ark of the Covenant will even be seen. That is where JESUS will appear and take possession of this evil world away from satan…[8/21, 17:44] Eseabasi Isip: Please its very important for us children of God bc we have been taught lies about rapture b4 TRIBULATION without scriptural backing, The time is come for us to worship God in spirit and truth! Please watch ‘AFTER THE TRIBULATION’?
[8/21, 18:00] Eseabasi Isip: Please watch ‘AFTER THE TRIBULATION’? By past Steven L Anderson and past Roger Jimenez.“Those of us who have been taught a pre-tribulation rapture cannot read Matthew 24 without concluding that Jesus placed the rapture immediately after the tribulation of those days.”When, oh dear Lord WHEN are people going to wake up to the fact that the “elect” in verse 31 are *not* the Church? These are the believing Jewish remnant that are being gathered back into the land of Israel after the Second Coming (at the sound of a great trumpet, no less) after being purged in the Great Tribulation in direct fulfillment of about a half a dozen Old Testament prophecies, some almost verbatim. They will be gathered back to the land to be ushered into the Millennial Kingdom because they are an integral part of it.I wish someone could explain to me how in heaven’s name an intelligent person can read Deuteronomy 30; Ezekiel 5, 6, 7, 11; Zechariah 2; Isaiah 10, 11, 27, 43; Hosea 3 and not see this. It’s as plain as the nose on your face.My dear post-trib brothers in Christ, if you insist that the “elect” in verse 31 is the Church and NOT the direct fulfillment of these prophecies, then all you have to do to back it up is show us where else in the Word these prophecies ARE fulfilled. We’ll be waiting. Because not to put too fine a point on it or anything, but if you *can’t* (and I already know you can’t) then you are effectively calling God a liar and a welcher.Guess you’ll miss the marriage supper of the lamb. Stay behind if you want to…..I’m out of here!!!! We are not appointed to wrath.What “WRATH” are you referring to? The wrath of GOD isn’t until the Bowl Judgments (plagues). That happens right after the 7th trumpet.
The Christians will be raptured out just prior to the last 7 judgments. The first resurrection, the glorious appearing and the rapture are ALL one big huge cataclysmic event…Karen Porter    Ummm, “I’m out of here!!!” where you going? and, how you planning on getting there? I’m trying to see it from your eyes I…don’t think your going anywhere. I mean…. I wish your view, and all who think the secret rapture is what’s going to happen; in fact, if I were a christian wanting to learn how to understand the Bible and the secret, thing.    Jesus said if they say He, is in the desert go not forth, if He is here or their, or wherever. “this is the one I like”, If they say, He is in the, SECRET, SECRET, SECRET, chambers, believe them not; just the fact that Jesus even uses the exact word “Secret” should speak volumes to this false teaching. It’s not Biblical Karen. It’s more a fairy tale and, indirectly, instead of winning people to Jesus, I’m afraid it makes more people question as to why; if their is a God, He would do such a thing as in take all the good out; leaving the rest on earth, walking around aimlessly. Saying, what do we all do now? Cars crashing, planes diving into the mountains.     Question, those on a plane die because the pilots were Christians; and so when do all the ones left behind on that plane get a chance to make it right with God or do they go to heaven?? or is there something I’m missing? another secret rapture perhaps, just for them?? where do they go? The second resurrection maybe?? might be a third I’ll try look for it. If someone I love dearly is not in this secret thing and dies right away, can I ask God to bring her to heaven?      So if half of my family misses this secret, what do ya call it? snatching away, and I’m in heaven with God wondering if my close family, friends, relatives, pastors, evangelists, dogs, cats, hamsters, birds, OK I’ll stop. But my point is how can that make sense, that we are enjoying the bliss of eternal life; celebrating the marriage supper of the Lamb, having the time of our life, not asking questions about, or, better yet, not ask questions, but wondering in our minds, thoughts, that may be rather unsettling; “will they ever see their, LEFT BEHIND FAMILY MEMBERS again” Left to the mercy of the Antichrist? And Jesus just says don’t worry about them if they make the right choice you will see them again? I WONDER WHO THEN IS GOING THROUGH THIS 7 YEAR TRIBULATION US, IN HEAVEN, OR THEM ON EARTH. Where would you rather be???    Both scenarios beloved; be, we left behind, or we are with God. Cannot at all make sense.   Will any who are celebrating have a look of fear or a happy smile, smiling continually not a care that my sister was on that plane.     I will apologize to you I don’t mean to be rude but I’m just; well, I can’t believe something that is not even Biblical is accepted in main stream Christianity. And very intellectual people write so professionally with big words and leads nowhere.          O…..does God take are emotions away, so we don’t have to worry if our loved ones will make it; maybe he removes them from our mind temporarily? I really want you to see and very sorry,there is no such thing, at all, it is a devil spun web of lies to get you to not worry about the mark of the beast; and that God will give this horrible world and the wicked a 2nd chance. Truly they will have there opportunity but not like you believe.     Again I’m not trying to belittle you. I’m actually belittling the notion that this SECRET thing is highly regarded as truth. I suppose letting there congregations think we are not to worry about the mark of the beast and the mark of his name and 666. is smother than saying we will all go through the time of trouble.    I hope you forgive me again I mean this for your good and all who need understanding. May God Bless You Karen and any who may question this “SECRET RAPTURE THEORY”  at least one more time.The sign of Jesus Christ coming is:

In regards to the topic, it should be studied at great length to take into account ALL scripture that pertains to the topic where many people get off track is when they do not acknowledge the totality of scripture on the topic and there comes their misunderstanding of it.
People who speak against the pre-trib rapture never can prove what they say to be true as it is revealed that they do not truly study or meditate on the scripture to find the true meaning. Revelation 11:15-19 does not teach or show Jesus return nor does it speak of the harpazo which is the original word Paul uses to descibe the rapture.
The last trump refers to the Feast of Trumpets and the Jewish practice of blowing trumpets at this feast each year.
During the ceremony there are a series of short trumpet sounds concluding with one long trumpet blast which is called the Tekiah Gedolah, the great trumpet blast. This is what Paul means by the last trump.
There are 4 trumpet blasts First is the Tekiah; Second is The Shevarim; Third is The Teruah;
Fouth is the Tekiah Gedolah which is a repeat of the First only it is extremely long called the grand or great trumpet blast , It has nothing to do with the 7th trumpet in Revelation .
The 7th trumpet in Revelation does however relate to Joel 2:1-2 ““Blow a trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the Lord is coming; surely it is near, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness.”
A posting by James reveals truth that the “last trump” spoken of by Paul was of encouragement to the people refering that the “last trump” is a time of relief for followers of Christ while the 7th trumpet in Revelation is one of woe for the time has come that great judgment has come , a time of great tribulation with earthquakes . great hail storms etc. The 7th trumpet in Revelation is referring to the Lord who is in heaven is enacting His authority on and over those in control on earth casting His wrath on the Antichrist and those who reject Christ as savoir.
Another area those who scoff at the pre-trib is they do not study all of scripture , consider the 144000 Jews that recieve a seal from God to protect them from harm during the great tribulation . Firstly scoffers do not understand the distinct difference between the Church and the orthodox Jews . the Church is comprised of people from all over the world who have accepted Christ as savoir , they are ‘born again’ the only people who are the Church are ‘born again’ followers of Christ Jesus whereas the orthodox Jews while they seek to serve Yaweh God they reject Jesus as Messiah , they are still looking for their Messiah and refuse/reject Jesus as the Messiah . As such their rejection of Messiah Jesus leads them into the Great Tribulation where many of them finally understand Jesus is their Messiah and die as martyers of Christ during the great trib. The 144000 appear during the first half of the 7 year treaty which is also the 70th week of Daniels 70th week prophecy . During this time they are protected from harm with the seal in their foreheads given to them by God . Their purpose is to spread the Good News Gospel of Jesus the Messiah to those living during the great trib . Give some thought to ..
Now there are  approx 2+ Billion born again followers of Christ spreading the gospel of Christ evangelising to get people to accept Christ as their Lord and savoir right now today , there is no need for 144000 specially sealed people to do the same thing when those who reject Christ now , they will reject Christ if someone with a seal on their forehead told them the same thing as Christians do . The Church , the born again followers of Christ will not be on earth during the Great Trib , but lets just think of it as if they were ; Think of it as a Christian who has served Christ most of their life and then there are some Jews that have accepted Christ and became ‘born again’ and they get special treatment from God being given a special seal from God on their forehead that protects them from harm while preaching the gospel while you as Christian do not get the special seal of protection from harm , most Christians would wonder and want to know why they are not given protection, they would feel left out , slighted as if they are not justified for protection , something along those lines.
Point being is that the Church ,the ‘born again’ followers of Christ are not on earth during the Great Trib, rather it is the Jewish remnant that reject Christ who go through the Great Trib and because of the preaching of the gospel of Christ by the 144000 who are protected by the seal of God can show those who have rejected Jesus that Christ is who he said he is , as the billions of Christians are not on earth and the result of 144000s’ testimony is a ‘number so geart that no one can count’ have accepted Christ as savoir and have been martyrd and “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. ”
IF people would do an in-depth study they will find that the ‘born again’ follwers of Jesus are not on earth during the Great Trib period of time , rather it is the time of Jacobs trouble , it is the Jews that reject Christ who are on earth during that time and many of them finally accept Christ as savoir. It simply makes no sense and does not align with scripture to think that ‘born again’ followers of Christ who have given up their own will to do the will of God The Father would be put in a position that they cannot be allowed to have a job , pay bills, buy food etc without accepting the Mark 666 that would cause them to forfiet their right to eternity with God Almighty . Everyone may have an opinion but if they are willing to study they will find many many scriptures that align perfectly with the pre-trib harpazoThe Christians won’t be on earth during the “great” tribulation b/c JESUS will come and raise them up on the last day before the last 7 bowl/vial judgments. That is the great tribulation and the scriptures tell us that the church is not appointed to the wrath of GOD.
It therefore has to be a pre-wrath rapture. Nobody is going anywhere before the antichrist or the mark of the beast. We’re all in it together, the saved and the unsaved, the wheat and the tare, the sheep and the goats. JESUS told us we “must” persevere to the end.
We are here for ALL of the judgments except the last 7 bowl judgments (plagues). When JESUS appears in the clouds, (His glorious appearing)then that is the time of the1st resurrection and that is the rapture of the saints all wrapped up into one big event. He will be with His angels, and this time He will NOT touch the ground. The saints are coming UP, they’re not coming down.Yes, I agree with you pre-trib. You are so right. The Scripture tells us in 1 Thessalonians 5:9, ‘For God hath not appointed us to ‘wrath’ but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.” The Great Tribulation is considered the time when God is pouring out his Wrath. Why would God pour out his wrath on believers. I thinking the Church (Believers in Christ) can not be here on Earth when God is pouring out his Wrath on unbelievers. This is the reason for the 144,000 being sealed. Just like when the children of Israel were in Egypt, the blood on the door post was for protection when the death Angel kill all of the first born of Egypt. During the time of the Great Tribulation the 144,000 are sealed for protection so that they can continued to witness to unbelievers while God’s wrath is being pour out. I’m no Bible Scholar but it doesn’t make sense to me for believers the (Church) to be present when God is pouring out his wrath and only 144,000 are covered. So the rest of the Christians are being punished by God when they accepted Jesus Christ? God’s wrath is not aimed to improve and make holy, but to destroy. I understand that the early church and we Christians today will go through trails and tribulations. But our trails and tribulations now are due to the fact that Satan is the Prince of the air. And he persecute the Church of God. But Christians experiencing trials and tribulations due the the evil that exist in the world today is different from the wrath of God that is being pour out during the tribulation. I believe that the Church is taken up before the Great tribulation because as stated by Paul ‘God has not appointed us (Believers) to suffer Wrath. Revelation 16: 1 says, ‘Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”Those who are not truly engaged to Christ; commit spiritual fornication by sharing the cup of the Catholic church’s dogma; committing spiritual fornication, drunk with felsitic impure truth mingled with paganism and tradition. Nevertheless, the strong warning from these elect men, brothers, or the two witnesses; shout out a cry, with a sound of the symbolic trumpet in Zion; and is heard come out of these false systems; and, that go’s for every other church denomination that follow wrong doctrine. Even after they are killed, for the next 3.5 years true church people preach the 3rd Angels message as this is the probation period for the whole world.         After the 7 year mark, it is settled, two classes, those who are sealed by God, and those who are sealed by the devil. Then the 7 last plagues fall upon those who received the mark of the beast. After the 7th plague falls Jesus comes as “King of Kings and Lord of Lords” Sorry, but there is no pre this, or pre that. No Secret snatching away; that’s ridicules this teaching is not Biblical. And God’s Kingdom is not set up on earth until after the 1000 years are expired.         To sum it up, understand what I’m saying; when you get baptized, you become engaged to Christ. After comes the marriage supper of the Lamb; or if you like, the wedding reception for all those who represent the five faithful virgins. So what do you suppose comes next? after the reception; Yes the honeymoon, for a thousand years God takes us on a journey throughout the Universe as our Groom. As we follow Jesus, He gives us all the happiness and more. As when two get married the husband takes and surprises his bride. Likewise our Lord and Savior reveal’s all the mysteries, long kept from our world. Yes a stellar journey to worlds beyond worlds and all He has created. Neither eyes nor ears have seen and heard the things that God has prepared for those who love Him.            Long story short we also are given judgement; not to condemn, but to satisfy all our questions as to those who are not there with us. Like all the other worlds; God has created earth and it will always remain our home for all eternity. After the 1000 years, The New Jerusalem descends from Heaven. At which point the 2nd resurrection takes place; and the battle of Armageddon.            The devil marshals his forces of wicked people; from all generations, from mans first fall to the second coming of Christ. Like Noah’s Ark rode the waters at the great flood; so to, The New Jerusalem rides the flames, and fires that fall on all the wicked; as the whole world is engulfed as well. Some burn out fast, while others burn longer according to their sin and the lives they lived.           At last the enemy of all the condemned and evil angels are last to be consumed. After a long while all traces of man’s imperfections along with all the atoms basically are all consumed away gone. Sin and sinners are no more. The earth is then restored to its original beauty God gave to Adam and Eve. Then man is given back his home where he may live and build and prosper for eternal ages upon ages; and our King, Lord Jesus Christ, shall rein with His people He died for; and make planet earth the center of His universe. And God shall live with His people, and they will live with Him, forever and ever, through the unending ages to come. He will wipe all are tears from are eyes; and their will be no more pain or war. Please see ISAIAH 66: 1-24              And from one new moon to the next; from one Sabbath to the next Sabbath, shall all come before the King of Kings so we can worship, praise, glory, honor, with all adoration to our God who saved us and became our everything. God BlessHello
Hope you are doing well, the title of thread is WHEN is the Rapture , not when is the 2nd coming
I would not ask anyone to do anything that I am not willing to do so I am providing scripture that substantiates what I say.
The 7th trumpet in Revelation in no way speaks of the rapture , lets examine the word rapture
1 Thessalonians 4:17 After that, we who are still alive and are left will be Caught Up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.
The words”caught up” is the English translation of the Greek word “Harpazo” and is what Paul said in his writings to the church  , Harpazo is defined as :  to seize, carry off by force, to snatch out or away , to pluck , to take suddenly and vehemently, quickly and without warning. The idea is to take by force with a sudden swoop and usually indicates a force which cannot be resisted.
Paul states in Corinthians 15: 52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for  the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
The words ” in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye” means-> moment (Greek = atomos) which is defined as the smallest division of time , a millisecond
Thessalonians is considered to be the oldest book of the new testament and the book of Corinthians was written shortly afterwards , the book of Revelation by John was written decades after Thessolonians and Corinthians.
Therefore it is impossible that Paul was making any reference to the 7th trumpet in the book of revelation because John had not even yet been given the vision from the LORD , Paul could not make reference to a book that had not been written or a vision that had not yet been given yet to John , and when John did receive the vision he was exiled from society on the island of Patmos and the only way he could pass along his vision is by writing it down further proving that the Last Trump Paul refers to is as stated a reference to the Feast that is given EACH year which the trumpet Tekiah Gedolah, is the last trumpet blast.
wandakate I see that you state that the book of revelation is not written in a chronilogical order but there is no scripture that substantiates that the bowl judgments come before the seal judgments.
Yet we see that wrath comes in the 6th seal judgment Rev 6:12 and the 144000 comes before the bowl judgments and even the 2 Witnesses come before the bowl judgments and are dead in the streets then are called to “come up here” into heaven immediately before the 7th trumpet bowl judgment , The 2 Witnesses who were dead and people in Israel are celebrating their death are called back to life rise up and ascend into heaven.
Lets look at the scripture carefully The scripture speaks directly to the church in 7 different letters to 7 churches that not only existed in the time of its writing but also in reference to how the body of Christ would be living up to the time of the rapture , study deeply the 7 churches and you will see that we are now living in a time that represents the Laodicean church.
 The manner in how the greater percentage of modern day churches teach , maybe just maybe 1 percent of the modern day church will teach truly teach on the End Times or prophecy as most will avoid it completely if possible or just teach lightly like a stone skipping across the surface of the river . Studies show that more than 50% of Christians in America who participated in surveys believe there are many paths to heaven inspite of the fact that Christ said there is only ONE way which is through him.
Revelation Chapters 1-3 use the word church but the word church is not found again until chapter 22 after Christ has returned to earth  and it is shown that the Church is coming back WITH Christ to reign and rule.
Consider that in the eastern hemisphere there are many who have died because they serve Jesus and face a much greater level of persecution today than the western hemisphere , Simply stated in all instances where the harpazo/rapture is spoken of in scripture using the actual verbiage of harpazo there is no mention of earthquakes no mention of darkened or black clouds , no mention of any blood moon, no mention of Jesus riding a white horse, simply because those things do not happen at the time of the harpazo.
IF they did we would have scripture that plainly state such. The scripture simply does not state in any way that the harpazo happens immediately before the great trib.
 Again consider the 144000 that appear during the first half of the 2520 days of  Daniels 70th week prophecy the first 1260 days ,  if they were on earth at the same time that 2+ billion  born again Christ followers were here the non-believers would still not accept Christ anymore than they do today , Since the vatican has created a new church called chrislam , and the vatican is now teaching that Jesus is the son of lucifer and singing songs praising lucifer. After the rapture non-believers will be likely to accept the teaching of Messiah Jesus when they see a member of the 144000 preaching Messiah Jesus as savoir and they cannot be harmed which would include not be killed.
When people say “Nobody is going anywhere before the antichrist or the mark of the beast.’
or “We are here for ALL of the judgments except the last 7 bowl judgments (plagues)” They should be willing to provide scripture that clearly states these things
Colossians 3:4King James Version (KJV)
4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall YOU also appear with him in glory
1 Corinthians 6: 2 Do ye not know that The Saints Shall Judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you,are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that We Shall Judge Angels?
1 Thessalonians 3:13King James Version (KJV)13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, At the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ WITH all his Saints.
Revelation 19:14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, Clothed in Fine Linen, White and Clean.
Jude 14 King James Version (KJV)
14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,
Colossians 3:4King James Version (KJV)
4 When Christ, who is our life, Shall Appear, then Shall YOU also Appear WITH HIM in Glory.
Praise be to the LORD and receive all the Glory that he gave us the opportunity to be His heirs , Bless the LORD and His saints AmenHi Luke:
After reading your post, of Sept. 4, 2016. I had to write you. With all due respect, the “Secret” rapture, everyone is talking about here, is just a theory; forced to fit Bible prophecy. Let me explain, 1 Thess 4: 13-18 says: “with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first” “Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them In the clouds” In context, this has to be the 2nd coming of Christ. All eyes will see Him, the trump here indicates, It will be very loud, and physical.
This is the first resurrection for those who sleep in Christ, and all the living in Christ shall go up to Heaven. One time, all at once.
To believe anything otherwise would make God out to be, as some have said; kinda nonsense.
 Did God go back after Noah’s day to give the people that drowned, another chance? Not So. And to confirm this; remember Jesus said, when He comes back, our days would be like that to Noah’s day. My friend, those who are left behind when He returns, are lost, there is no other chances and; it dose go on to say, that those not saved who are alive at the second coming would be destroyed by the brightness of His coming.
 As lighting shines from the east and to the west, so shall also the Son of man be on His day. As you know a electrical storm is used as an analogy to the description of the second coming; in this sense, all will see His coming. Jesus never spoke of a third coming. What I’m saying is this “rapture” and second coming, are one and the same. Not that I like using this word, but for your benefit.
The parable of the ten virgins; 5 were wise, and 5 were foolish; must be understood. Do you remember what the 5 foolish said to the 5 wise? They asked for their oil, so they may enter into the marriage supper of the Lamb? They said, not so; the 5 foolish now portrayed the lost souls living at the 2nd coming of Christ; and it says they were destroyed by the brightness of His coming, to recap this. And why would God give this people in our generation another chance? Will He have another wedding I don’t no about? Friend, and all who read this; don’t sit around waiting for this deadly teaching: called the “secret rapture” to happen; it’s not Biblical; and will not happen that way. The time to receive God is now not tomorrow. So be ready regardless.
 Sorry if you believed this theory, however long, long; nevertheless, truth has to be told.
Ask yourself, why would God do it this way? After the 2nd coming, we enter the marriage supper of the Lamb. If God came back for those who never made this 2nd coming; wouldn’t that be segregating? the believers, with the non believers, if they were to be saved, as to a 2nd chance? And when you get to know Jesus, He is not like that.
 Their is one God, one Church, one baptism, one faith, and, one marriage; called, the marriage supper of the Lamb. He is not the God of confusion.
After the 1000 years, all the saved and saints descend with God, in the New Jerusalem, back on planet earth, on the old Jerusalem site. Then the 2nd resurrection takes place; and, the 2nd death,and Armageddon. The last war on earth, between good and evil. Thereafter, the world burns with intensive fire, and the evil receive their duration to burn, according to the measure of wickedness they committed.
 Remember, there are a lot of people who believe this theory and don’t bother reading as too the time of trouble they will go through or, the mark of the beast.
Just understand this; I have talked with so many people who don’t believe in God; but, have said, “If you people, believe God will snatch you away” as two one is taken, and one is left. Then I will believe in God. As silly as this teaching is to them; is as silly as it is for any to teach that God will do it that way. Those who say well I have a second chance to be a believer; but not until after that happens. And it won’t, are in deep trouble. Do you see the deadly teaching this posses, in this secret thing? Jesus said if they say to you, “lo, He is here or there, believe them not, and if they come to you and say, He is in the “Secret Chamber’s”, go not forth” God even use’s the word “Secret” here. So basically anything to do with a “secret” whatever, believe them not. This would be rather confusing to say the least.
After the fire burns out, God recreates the world and restores it back to Eden, for all of us to inherit the world. And so shall we be with our God; Jesus, King of King’s and Lord of Lords. AmenThe Judgment of the Dead11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done. 14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. 15 ANYONE whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.Does the above scripture suggests that all the Dead that were raised were all thrown in the Lake of Fire?Your thoughts please.Hi eaglet, your post of October 8th/16. You’re confusing the time of the Millennium, and the 1st & 2nd Resurrection, Armageddon, the Second Death, Finally Hell fire.
You have mixed them all together and with wrong doctrine you hold too therefore left you unsure as to what really is the truth?
I will break it up for you.
1) At 2nd Coming of Jesus Christ
2) 1st   Resurrection (this includes everyone from Adam to the 2nd Adam (Jesus) on His day.
3) All the righteous dead in their graves and all the righteous living are caught up to Heaven. Too the one marriage supper of the lamb.
4) All the evil dead remain in their graves for judgment, all evil alive at the 2nd Coming are destroyed by the brightness of His Jesus Coming, they fall to the earth and no man is alive on earth to bury them.
5) Judgement is given to the saints now this is usually confusing to some. What I’m trying to say is imagine you’re in Heaven and someone you knew who you thought would be there in fact is not? Are you going to go through eternity never asking God why he/she is not there? Could you just imagine the line up of people that need answers from God? It would be so crazy. So why is judgment given to the saints? If you know Scripture well; then you know about the three books. 1st one is the book of life, the 2nd one is the book of remembrance, and the 3rd book is the book of iniquity (SIN). While in Heaven books are open the saint’s judge. What are they judging right? Well if that person you thought to see in Heaven is not there, you will be able to see why. This is called the great white throne Judgment all the books on every individual that are not in Heaven are there for you to judge yourself as to how God came to that decision on that individual. A quick note to keep in mind is if your name is in the book of life then you are saved. Therefore the book of iniquity or all your sins are in that book is covered by the blood of Christ. However the book of Remembrance of you is kept for eternity as a record of all the wonderful things you did in this life.
6) The earth is left a desolate void of darkness and is the prison house of the devil and his evil demons. They will have a thousand years to contemplate the misery they caused; what they have done in the past 6000 years. If you have to know the 1000 years + 6000 years = 7000 years this is a complete 7 day spectrum. A day in the sight of God is like a thousand years and a thousand years is like a day.
7) All the saved descend from Heaven in the New Jerusalem after the 1000 years; all 100% in union with God, now the evil receive their punishment. Now you see why God gives us the books of unsaved; had He, God, put them in Hell Fire before we seen the books, this would be quite confusing. Again after the 1000 years everyone is satisfied with all the questions they ever had and all answered.
8) 2nd Resurrection happens all the evil from all generations in one big armada side with the devil. Note during the 1000 years the devil and his demons are chained as a result of circumstances. When it says the devil must be loosed for a little season; simply means when the evil come to life again satan now has people to play with again. Now they are shown all there bad deeds and all bow to the King of Kings and acknowledge that Jesus did everything He could that they might be saved. But by their choice’s made the wrong ones. Jesus is vindicated.
9) The final Battle and the Last forever called Armageddon. As the devil marshals all the lost against the Emerald City all the saved inside are safe. Nevertheless the wicked hosts with the demonic armada are as the number of the sands of the sea. The devil makes the evil think he raised them from the dead and convince them if they could just get inside the City they would overthrow and take for themselves God’s people and their City. This is a reflection of Noah’s Ark, and The New Jerusalem if you can see the parallelism. One rides the waters and the other the flames that engulf the world.
10) Hell fire is it eternal? Not so, the evil prepare for war as they attack; fire falls from the Heavens and the earth opens and fire surrounds all the lost and the devil and demons together are in hell fire. Keep in mind for each person his duration in flames is according to their life to their sin. Example Hitler would obviously burn lot longer than say the average sinner. And the last to burn out is the rival enemy the devil himself; he will burn the longest each with their own punishment. Keep in mind the punishing is not eternal but the punishment is; when it says they will burn for eternity, simply means they will never ever come back.
11) The 2nd death is the final death the sinner receives as Jesus said the sinner shall die not live for eternity in hell fire. SIN = DEATH.
12) All fire is done sin and sinners are no more God re-establishes the Eden that once was given to our first parents. And when they fell were evicted from Eden. But Now Eden is given back as Jesus promised Adam and Eve that one day they would return and all the saved are given their earth back. Amen.eaglet: There are two resurrections and between them a 1000 years. 2nd coming 1st resurrection. New Jerusalem old temple mount, then 2nd resurrection and 2nd death. World made new by God, Sin and sinners are no more….Hi Luke:
My sincere apologies, I wrote to the wrong person regarding the topic of the “false Secret Rapture theory. God Bless, keep preaching truth.Dear Irvin , I share your opinion concerning the  time of the rapture . One needs only compare the ” rapture verses” in Ist Thessalonians 4 to Matthew 24 , the last trumpet, Jesus in the clouds , angels reaping …Its obvious that these verses are talking about the same event…the 2nd coming…” Immediately after the tribulation” as our Lord said!  Give the Bible to anyone who has never heard of ” the pre-trib rapture” and ask them to read it and then ask them when will the Lord Jesus return? They will tell you what the Bible says….immediately after the tribulation! Now to seal it up consider these verses spoken by Peter.. in Acts 3:20-21 KJV
And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: [21] Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
Note in verse 21 “Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things,” Jesus must remain in heaven until the second coming. If He comes back for a secret rapture before the second coming this scripture will be broken. Jesus said “The scripture can not be broken” Case closed! God bless you and  your ministry .

The pre-trib  rapture was unheard of prior to the mid 1800s. Why is it that this teaching took 1,850 years after Christ and 4000 years before to manifest itself?

When we ask god to forgive all our sins, he will forgive all our sins then why is that judgement day for? when he forgive all the sins?Mathew chapter 24 does it very clear when the rapture will happen.
24:15 WHEN ye therefore shall SEE the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)
That is why Paul wrote in 2 Thess. chapter two, that the day of Christ (the coming of our Lord, AND our gathering together unto him, the rapture verses one and two) Verse 3 Let no man DECEIVE YOU by any means: FOR THAT DAY shall NOT COME, EXCEPT there come a falling away first, AND that man OF SIN BE REVEALED, the son of perdition:
The man of sin is revealed WHEN YE therefore shall SEE him stand in the holy place (Revelation chapter 13), WHEN he goes into the temple of God, showing himself to be God, with lying signs and wonders, causing the world to worship him, AND he makes war with the saints (The church) and physically overcomes them. Then we can look up for our redemption draws nigh.
Matthew 24:21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. 22 And EXCEPT THOSE DAYS should BE SHORTENED, there should NO flesh BE SAVED: BUT FOR the ELECT’S SAKE THOSE DAYS SHALL BE SHORTENED.
There you have it in no uncertain words. The days of the great tribulation period WILL BE SHORTENED FOR THE ELECT OF GOD, which is the one body of Christ, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, but Christ is all, and in all. There is no rapture before those days, or after those days, but during those days, because except those days are shortened for the elect, no one would be saved, because as Jesus told us in the next chapter, at the midnight (Mid-tribulation) a cry was made (The last call for the kingdom of God), and the BRIDEGROOM cometh, and they that were ready went in with Him, and the door was shut, and that is Christ receiving His Bride, Jew or Gentile, all true believers, and He will not open the DOOR again, because He will not commit adultery after receiving His Bride. Matthew 24:29 Is telling about when He actually returns to set foot on earth, He will gather His elect out of heaven that were already in the rapture, and were already at the marriage supper of the Lamb, to ride with with Him, and the earth will wail because of His actual return to earth when He will rule with a rod of iron for one thousand years. That passage cannot be telling of the rapture because it was already made very clear in verses 21 and 22 that the days of the great tribulation period would be shortened for the elect, and that no flesh would be saved except those days were shortened for them during that time, so there can be no redemption after those days are shortened for the elect. It is very important to believe the truth, because all lies are from Satan, and he uses all lies to deceive, which is why Paul told us not to let any man deceive us by any means about these truths, because deceived people are not going to make it, but they will receive the mark of the beast, and suffer the wrath of God. Revelation chapter 14 also makes that very clear. I know that everyone will not receive these truths, only the elect of God will do so. Hebrews 10:22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, HAVING our hearts sprinkled FROM an EVIL conscience, and our bodies washed with PURE WATER. Romans 8:14 For as many as are led BY the SPIRIT OF GOD, they ARE the sons of God.Ever wonder if Donald Trump is the last Trump?How could he be?nope but wondered if Hillary isobviously not…he has children 🙂The topic is not that hard to understand if you are willing to put forth the time and study needed.
Here is an example analogy of how you pre-trib bashers assume things not in evidence:
Bob says he is going to go to church , Jane says she is going to go to church , bashers reasoning is Well since both Bob and Jane are going to church they Have to be going to the Same church at the Same time in the Same car !!   NO , it’s Not in the text nothing but assumption!!
Like wise when you see the name Jesus and clouds in a scripture you Assume it means the same thing , NOT- the text speaks of two entirely different things ! You will not find any scripture that says they are the same;  you just Assume and you have no facts! Just as those who teach mankind evolved from apes ,
There is nothing whatsoever in Matthew 24 that speaks about a Catching Away or being Caught Up into the clouds; but ASSUMPTIONS galore about it being the rapture , NOT-as  it Only speaks of Jesus Return to EARTH , and when that happens “EVERY EYE ” on earth will see Him coming. EVERY scripture that speaks of the “rapture/being caught up” has NOTHING in it about Jesus being seen or coming to earth!! False doctrine ASSUMES the ERROR of both HAPPENING IN ONE EVENT or After the Great Trib
Yes,  Acts 3:20-21 speaks of Jesus remaining in the heavens until His Return to Earth , which  supports the pre-trib rapture scriptures stating that believers will be “Caught UP” snatched away by force UP INTO the Clouds and so shall we ever be with the Lord. We go UP INTO the clouds and Jesus takes us to our Heavenly Home.
There is NO Reference of any kind to anyone on earth Seeing Jesus at the rapture, it happens faster than the eye can see; it is only those who are “caught up” that will see Jesus . Learn that there are 3 heavens and Jesus is in the 3rd heaven at the throne , Ha-satan the ‘accuser of the brethern’ roams to and fro in earth and the 2nd heaven which is just above the clouds and he has access to the 3rd heaven where he goes to the LORD GOD’s throne to accuse the believers of sin/improper conduct , read the book of Job !
Daniels 70th week is the final 7 years of human run government and it begins when the Son of perdition confirms the covenant treaty that promises Israel 7 years of peace and security , this treaty has been discussed by Israel and her enemies a few times since the late 1960’s just not confirmed as of yet but when it is it will be the Man of Sin/lawlessness who confirms it .
Simple logic here , if the church was on earth at that time , it would possible to predict when Jesus returns because His words says a total of 2520 days till the 70th week is over. Now read the scriptures and note that at the rapture “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven(the 3rd heaven into the clouds)…The dead in Christ RISE first Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  Wherefore Comfort one another with These words.
There is a whole teaching on the biblical First Fruits that gets it’s origin from the Jewish tradition of harvesting fruit . You first harvest what is ripe now and then go back and harvest the rest after the rest of it has ripened , not all fruit is ripened at the same time , Then there is the practice of harvesting from the 4 corners of the vineyard but this gets to long for posting at this time.
At Jesus appearing , Jesus Sends angels to gather the remnant of the Jews and those who have accepted Christ as savoir during the great trib ..
At the rapture Jesus Himself calls us UP INTO the Clouds
At Jesus return to earth He sends angels to gather those on earth….
At Jesus glorious Appearing Both All the Saints in heaven And the Angels Are Seen coming Down from the clouds With Jesus in Glory
Again to summarize : In ALL scriptures that speak of the 2nd coming of Christ there is NO reference whatsoever to a sudden catching away or being Caught up INTO clouds and in ALL scriptures that speak of a catching away or being caught UP INTO the clouds there is NO reference whatsoever to any earthquakes . no mention of the sun being darkend and not giving any light , no mention of the moon not giving of light , no blood moon , no powers of the heavens being shaken no mention of any tribulation,no mention of any woes , in fact in the scripture that speaks of being caught UP INTO the Clouds.
Paul says Comfort one another with these words ,  there is no reference to any comfort in the scriptures about the 2nd coming of Christ . Whereas comparing to Matthew 24 it is all about sufferings , pain and sorrows, the world abounds in wickedness and the love of vast amounts of people grow cold and hatred increases. It is easy to see who does not truly study the history or scriptures as the teaching of the pre-trib rapture was believed in the early church as records indicate in the 3rd century it was widely accepted even though St. Jerome who wrote the original Latin Vulgate catholic bible in the early 400’s and he first used the root words rapiemur, rapio, which has the same meaning as harpazo and it was the Protestants who introduced the English word rapture.
It was around the same time period when the accepted teaching of the Holy Trinity was widely accepted as it was never intended to be a doctrine rather just a way to explain in human terms who the creator of life truly is . The pre-wrath teaching was by a man in the late 20th century.
The reason that the pre-trib harpazo is the most popular view is simply because it is the only view that is supported and substantiated by scripture. Remove all the added assumptions from post-trib, pre-wrath and others and they fall apart because there is no scripture that supports them simply because the rapture happens at a different time period than Jesus appearing
Colossians 3:4King James Version (KJV)
4 When Christ, who is our life, Shall Appear, then Shall YOU ALSO Appear WITH HIM in Glory.This scripture plainly states that the saints will be WITH Jesus at his appearing.   Angels as well will be among them
Shalomyour argument doesn’t hold water.first off “then the tribes of the earth shall mourn” seems to me like they saw him appear.read matthew 24 and don’t just read it..study it.while you are at it study 1 thessalonians and get back to us.don’t be fooled the anti-Christ will trick those watching for the rapture into receiving the mark of the beast because like you they believe the rapture will occure first.I have heard about the rapture theory all of my christian walk. Nobody anywhere knows of the time, day, hour, year, not even Jesus. Only GOD knows the top secret plans. HE trust nobody with these details. There’s a devil who would love to spoil that glorious day with his counterfeit plans to detour as many souls into hell. Satan will get his spoils of those who will not be making heaven their home. We are to live and occupy time till that day comes…which may be 100 years from today! So live and occupy your life and stop worrying about that day…you have no control over it, that is still in the future!Amen brother…too many folks are so worried about the future event which they have no control of… period! You still have a life to live and a destiny to fulfill. Go and conquer!Hello ,
Many Americans refuse to see scripture outside of an American English perspective void of the orginal teaching.

.It is to one’s own advantage to truly seek the true teachings of our LORD Yeshua and by studying the Jewish culture will bring you understanding that is not found in the American western culture
ShalomJesus commanded that people love each other as he has loved you , but all this harsh allegations with no foundation is not what Jesus commanded of you , you can have a difference of opinion without calling truth a lie can you not ?
Consider you being accused of a crime would you not want the accusers to provide evidence and not just accusations?
It is easy to tell someone they are wrong , those of you who condemn the pre-trib rapture need to provide scripture evidence to substantiate what you proclaim , why have you not done this ?
Making assumptions is not evidence remember that it has been asked at least twice that I have seen but no evidence given yet !
Remember the rapture is a instant snatching away up into the clouds and there is no scripture speaking of that during Jesus appearing , why not provide conclusive evidence as the pre-trib camp does , and not just assuming things that are not found in scripture? post trib and pre wrath camps are not including a massive amount of scripture that speaks to the topic . If you order a cheeseburger and get a burger with no cheese , would you still call it a cheeseburger , if so why ?do you believe in Rapture?Yes, we believe that Jesus will return and the church will be caught away.The “rapture” and the 1st resurrection and the glorious appearing of JESUS are all one event. All happening at the same time. It happens at the 7th trumpet. It’s a pre-wrath rapture, happens just before the wrath of GOD is poured out on the unrepentant sinners.The rapture of the bride will happen right between the sixth and the seventh vial judgement. Checkout the following Scriptures:Rev. 16:12-15 – Before the Punishment of the Great Prostitute and Armageddon12 And the SIXTH ANGEL poured out his VIAL upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared…..15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.Rev. 21:9-110 – At the End of the Millennium9 And there came unto me ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS which had the SEVEN VIALS full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the BRIDE, the Lamb’s WIFE.10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,…With the above scriptures describing the event literally and so clearly, I guess the Rapture is not going to happen at the Seventh Trumpet Judgement. Last Trump or Trumpet Call could mean something else either from an earthly perspective or heavenly perspective.Yes it is…..but you need to understand that the 7th trumpet will sound for some days (Rev 10) and the bowls delivered during its long blast….that way the rapture occurs both at the sound of the 7th trumpet and between bowls 6 and 7..but the reason it is between bowls 6 and 7 is not for the reason you’ve highlighted but rather because of Rev 16:15 which is between the two bowls….When will be the great Rapture of the Church of the Lord? – (I agree with this message but I’ll reveal something else.) It will not be in 2017 … or will be in 2018 … or any of the coming years. If you know how to add, will be in a year 7! Why? Because the only key and clear for the Second Coming of Christ signal and to which we can go for sure provided us the Scriptures through the prophet Zechariah 14: 6-7 when read as follows: (RV1960 Ed.) 6 “And it come to pass in that day there will be, nor dark clear light.” 7 shall be one day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night; but it will happen that at evening time there shall be light. “(solar) (Does not God reveals to us from the beginning, in Genesis 1:14 that the sun, moon, Earth and stars “would serve as signs for days and years”?) Then ask: where will be happening this signal that reveals Zechariah 12: 6 and 7, and more or less at that time? I imagine that now you may find yourself sure with more curiosity and thirst to know more, is not it? To what source of information you then you would go to find and get ahead in knowing this signal which will happen where “His feet shall stand in that day”? (V.4) For this reason it is that almost all the Lord’s prophets in the Old Testament announced this day as dark, cloudy, etc. If you manage to find the source of information and that signal the near future on the place where the Lord “affirm their feet”, you will then subtract the 7 years of Daniel 9:27, as tribulation period (including the final 3½ years 70th Week of Daniel), and so you can get a year of expected Rapture of the Church of the Lord. After you succeed, you will be surprised when you start looking in that year the Rapture … as year totaling 7 also occur this kind of heavenly sign!…Alleluia! (Now watch and calculated well with your math because I’ll give a simple “little ear”: the number of days between the two heavenly signs will be: 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 … Do not you think this Number 7 “a guide to divine confirmation”?) If you manage all this, it is that then you’re starting to awaken God’s clock. Now you understand why “did not touch them the (first) disciples of Christ know the times and seasons (day and year, but to us, the last) that the Father has put in His own power.” (Acts 1: 7 )You wanna another Biblical explanation? Reread Psalm 90 of Moses, verse 10: “The days of our years are seventy years; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow, it is soon cut and … we fly.” If you look carefully and sums 70 + 80, you will have 150, which, if you divide from 2 to arrive at the normal “average” that would last a generation, which is 75 years. Further notes that does not end “: and die.” It says rather: and we fly away. Is not this what we will do in the Rapture? Now if Christ prophesied in Matthew 24:34 that “this generation shall not pass, till all these things”, and referred to the state of Israel restored, then, which one year we must get to be “raptured”? Here I leave ….The clear verse is Daniel 9:24 (verifies last days suffering for Israel’s 70 weeks ending sin and everlasting righteousness)
9:26 identify’s the Roman prince of the people to come (70ad) will 27)sign an agreement with many – the antichrist is a roman..And after his week then comes Christ from verse 24….So, are you saying that the rapture and the 2nd coming are the same event??Jesus repeatedly said in John 6 that His followers would be raised up at the last day.   That is the resurrection and Paul said in 1 Cor 15 v 51,52 that the rapture would occur immediately after the resurrection.  That is the framework to build around.The word Tribulation means suffering and it is – After the tribulation that is happening in the verses before it and does not mean the time of tribulation is over….Does it matter what rapture you believe?  Most certainly as we see 10 virgins to Christ who 5 become unwise because when the master is delayed they lose faith because pre trib rapture Jesus did not show which is why false christ are the first to show. Only to those who believe in the pre trib rapture will the coming rapture be delayed and the falling away happens…. same as lukes goodgfaithfull/less servant, when the master is delayed will christians stay the course and be wise knowing Christ will come or will they be unwise and turn back to their old ways before being saved…  returning to your own vomit the bible calls it…. 2 thess pauls tells us to wait with him (1:7)for the gathering to Christ but not to believe the rapture came before the falling away and the man of sin is revealed…. paul (us) waits for the tribulation rapture and the unwise virgins (to Christ) are then caught off guard when that Christ shows up…. So yeah it does matter when many virgins go out to meet a pre trib rapture Jesus that does not show… then all the false Christ come as it is the start of the tribulation – first in the Last days (start of) since Christ didn’t show they will say’s where is the promise of his coming?and the world has been told its a pre trib rapture that Is the promise.Forgot: first know in the last days shall come those after their own lust saying where is the promise of his coming?  (No bible near for verse sorry)Please tell all who are those listed in Rev 5:9-10? They are in heaven and we know the only way they could be there is by the acts of Jesus Christ. Please note that group is in the present heaven before the tribulation starts as no seals have been broken. Could it be that group is there as a fulfillment of two promises of our Lord Jesus Christ in Rev 3:8 and 10, when He says I will open a door that no one can close and that He will take them out of the way of a coming time period that will affect the entire world. Of course we are reading about a coming, a future time period. Please note this group will serve on the earth with Jesus Christ. Thus it is seen that scriptures do tell us about a group in the present heaven before the tribulation time period begins.Hi everybody.The second chance theory:         The teaching that man will be granted a second chance if he spurns this present opportunity to obey and be saved IS A MOST DANGEROUS AND FALSE DOCTRINE. It is simply Satan’s age old trick of holding up his clock which declares that you have all the time in the world, while destruction stands ready to strike you down for eternity. This theory (and that is all it really is, since it
cannot be found in the Bible) is also called “post millennialism,” a term meaning there is still a chance for one to be saved after the miilliennium has come. I repeat this is not true, my friends! let’s see what the word of God says and what the truth is in regard to this.       The prophet Isaiah said: “for the grave cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth” Isaiah 38: 18. After a man dies, there is no more hope for him to change. If by then he has not made peace with God, it is forever too late. So, when should we get ready for such an eventuality? The Bible says again “…As the Holy Ghost saith, To day if you will hear His voice, Harden not your hearts,…” see Hebrews 3: 7-15.        “…..Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. ” 2 Corinthians 6: 2. Procrastination does not come from the Lord but from the enemy of souls. The time of grace will soon be over. Just before Christ’s second coming, the harvest of the world will be gathered and the good wheat separated from the tares. There will be no repeal of this verdict ( see Matthew 13: 38-43), The door into the Kingdom will then be closed forever, and no late comers will be admitted. This is clearly shown in the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25. That the decision for or against eternal life has to be made before the coming of Christ is evident from the parable of the judgment in Matthew 25: 31-46         When Christ comes again, He comes for the purpose of delivering the reward to His faithful ones and judgment to the unbeliever (Revelation 22: 11, 12). The fact that He will bring with Him this reward according to our works establishes the fact that this reward must have been decided beforehand.       Satan tries to make people believe that they do not haven to hurry to seek salvation. If he succeeds in making a man come too late, he will have won the battle over that man. The prophets have always urged, Make your calling and election sure right now without delay.The only problem in reading the Bible is not it’s statements, but what people say about it’s statements. Like nature is to the scientist, it must be allowed to tell it’s own story. Too often we come to it with our own preconceptions , which are mostly misconceptions. Thus the world is full of people who are very vocal about their own opinions but do not invite others to read the Scripture on the subject for themselves to see if it is true. I find this article therefore very logical in terms of the way the Bible is set out, and very honest. I believe it will stand up to scrutiny for anyone, who, like the ancient Bereans, checks it against scripture to “see if these things be so.”You call the Father which is Yahweh , daddy?  Why is that because priest in Catholicism are called Father, by Catholics?Gary W. Stanfield: Jesus said call no man your father on the earth. As our Father in Heaven is only to be called by that name. Within the word SABBATH is ABBA interpreted as Daddy. Remember we are to be like little children to God. Unless we become as the little children we may not enter heaven.
Emmanuel means God with us. It’s another way of saying the Word of God the Holy Bible are living words. Therefore God’s Bible is the Manuel for us at birth to death. Yes we were created shouldn’t we come with instructions?Joseph you ask me what made me think that you are a Catholic?  For one, the last day message of Christianity is love and brotherhood, using the Pope’s Ecumenical Movement to bring all denominations and religions under the Pope’s authority for these end times.  Then you said “will only touch the Heart of Jesus”  That proves you do not know who the Messiah is or what His name is or what his real birth given name was at birth.The Secret Rapture       The teaching of the secret rapture (or “snatching away”) of the church has caught the fancy of many fundamentalist Christian believers. This mystical interpretation of some of Jesus” words in His great prophecy of Matthew 24 is in keeping with the mysterious atmosphere pervading the religious world today. There is a definite trend toward occult, little understand, fantastic, far-out practices and beliefs. Now matter how strange an idea may be, there are always a sizable number of intelligent people who will embrace it as gospel truth. The rapture theory is one sensational teaching which thousands of people confidently expect to happen at any moment. I have had non believers who find it hard to accept that God is a reality at all; say “if you Christians talk about a secret rapture and God will take you up, snatching you away, well then I will believe it then.” They also were told if you don’t make this secret thing, then they will be granted a second chance. No,.. they are lost, and that is a fact people.The false theory     For those who are not acquainted with this erroneous teaching, we shall enumerate some of its details. The second coming of Christ, its proponents say, will be secret and invisible and the angels will gather the elect and snatch them away from the earth to meet Him in the air. This secret coming will introduce a period of   seven years, at the end of which Christ is supposed to come again. At the beginning of this 7-year period, they surmise that the antichrist is to appear as a world ruler (in line with Revelation 13: 1-10) and the Jews will then flock to Palestine under the protection of world rulers. They assume the temple will be rebuilt on the ancient site (right now a Mohammedan Mosque stands on the spot) and after 3.5 years the antichrist will repudiate his treaty with the Jews, causing the “sacrifice and oblation to cease” in the midst  of the 7 years. This event marks the beginning of the great tribulation of Matthew 24: 21, 22. This tribulation is thought to be caused by the violation of the covenant between the Jews and the antichrist.      We won’t hold it against anyone if he can’t follow the reasoning  underlying these predictions. It Is undoubtedly one of the most blatant distortions of the Bible facts we have yet seen.So pre trib, and mid trib are wrong correct? Well if that’s the case then I’d say yeah that makes sense.No one needs to guess as to the subject of the rapture. Our Bibles are very clear on that teaching. Our Lord Jesus Christ has made two promises concerning the rapture of the church. He promises to open a door no one can close and to take the church out of the way of a coming time period called the hour of trail, the hour of testing, the hour of temptation depending on your Bible version.  Those promises are found in Rev 3:8 &10. Rev 4:1 serves as both a call to John and a call to the church. Rev 5:9-10 reveals the church in heaven. Of course all this is a program of coming events, like a program of a play at a night club. The rapture of the church will only involve those alive at the time, and will be very much like our Lord’s ascension into heaven listed in Acts 1:9-11, and the rapture of the two witnesses listed in Rev 11:12. In all three occurrences  there is a call from heaven to those being taken up. The rapture or taking up of the church will be a Pre-Tribulation event, the reason being the tribulation has nothing to do with the church. Daniel 9:24 clearly gives the reason for the 70th week which is the coming 7 years of tribulation. That time period is about His chosen people the Jewish people and His Holy City Jerusalem. Clearly seen and noted in the above writing is the fact that the group listed in Rev 5:9-10 will serve on the earth. That is also seen in Rev 1:5-6 as a pre-rapture, and in Rev 20:6 in a post 2nd coming during the 1000 year millennial time period on this present earth. This website contains information that is right on as far as to coming events. Yet, a Post rapture is not a correct rendering from our Bibles. Not meant to be critical as this site does contain the most actuate information of any site thus far found. The above is meant to fulfill  2Timothy 3:16, to correct. Thanks to all for your interest in our Lord Jesus Christ.The Bible does not teach a secret or an invisible coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 9:28 clearly states there will be a second coming. Mat 24:29 clearly tells all; immediately after the tribulation of those days. Further our Lord does not come from heaven at the time of the rapture of the church. No scripture verses ever tell us about our Lord coming from the present heaven then re-entering into the present heaven. All should do their own search, yet, no such scriptures will be found. Sadly all should realize that many pastors do teach such a swooping down out of the present heaven, a gathering up of the elect and a return into the present heaven. That is a shameful teaching. Clearly taught is the gathering in Mat 24:31; Mark 13:27; Luke 21:28; Paul says in 2Thes 2:1,  Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, . Our Bibles do not contain any secret or invisible  coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, such a coming is generated in the minds of man.Concerning the rapture: The rapture, or Parousia as it is known in original text is real. As real as a heart attack. And it is close. How close ? Extremely close. There exists an unlimited variability of interpretations concerning when because the text deliberately denies an easy solution concerning timing. We all thought Gog and Magog were Russia, and they may yet be. But it is abundantly evident that the heavy players forcing the rise of Antichrist and the accompanying threat of global war, and blatant threat to Israel’s existence is the global the rise of Islam. Islam has forced the confrontation which has brought about the rise of the two Wittnesses. The rise of the Two Wittnesses as per Rev. 11 verse 4 and their deaths as per the duel with the Beast may and very likely will immediately preclude the rapture. UNESCO just formally issued a declaration that Israel has no valid territorial claim to the City of Jerusalem. Israel is not backing down. Prime Minister Netanhahu has severed the relationship with UNESCO over it’s statement. UNESCO is bowing to Islam at Israel’s expense. Make no mistake,  Islam is a type of antichrist and will support the Antichrist 100%. The two Wittnesses are tuning up. They’re here, it’s coming. One warning: Jesus warned us not to cast our pearls before swine………observance of this warning is not politically correct. It will cause micro aggressions. All who are participating in this discussion are not Christians………some fit Jesus’ definition of ….e. This is the real deal. This is spiritual war. The war of love in Jesus’ name.Dr Morcraft seems to feel that he has the handle on where our Lord does or does not come from when he arrives to gather his people. Does the good doctor really presume the school of thought which interprets the return of our Lord Jesus as “coming from above as shamefull ?” Shame has to do with inequity , sin , deceit as taught by the values of Christ. A different interpretation than that of Dr Morhead regarding New Testament scripture is possibly inaccurate but “shameful” is Pharisaic. The Lord is cast in Rev. 1 verse 7 : Behold he
cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him….”. Clouds , good doctor are above. Hence the interpretation of the Lord as coming from above. Our Lord is omnipotent, which means everywhere at once. Hence he is in heaven even as he arrives with his angels to gather his people. Since heaven is the principal residence of his glory it may be said without error that he comes from heaven. He can if he wants to and unless explicitly stated otherwise we less lauded saints may regard his arrival as such without having the adjective “shameful” attached to us.Rapture-Pre-Trib, Mid-Trib, or Post-Trib?We believe that the Bible teaches a post-tribulation rapture (Matthew 24:29-31).For those who do not believe in a rapture and those who prefer to believe the versions of the rapture that is not supported by scripture but only supported by those who teach a version that is not accurate , here is scripture that fully proves a rapture and what happens during a rapture . Personally it matters not what others believe but I am obligated unto the LORD to speak His truth and hopefully people will learn , take time to study and learn what scripture teaches .
This rapture is not the rapture of the whole church but is an example of a rapture of just one man and the scripture uses identically the exact same word that Paul used in Thessalonians where Paul describes the rapture of the whole church , the bride of Christ this word is Harpazo.
Harpazo is the original Greek word in scripture which was translated into Latin as raperium ,  rapiemur . rapio and then translated into English as rapture , they all mean the same thing referring to the sudden unexpected snatching away, catching away ,caught away suddenly by force and taken to another location
Book of Acts 8:34-40
38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
40 But Philip was found at Azotus:
The story of Phillip baptism of the eunuch , read all verses 34-40 and notice that the words “caught away” in verse 39 are in the Greek writing of Acts 8:39 is  Harpazo – identically exactly the very same word used in Thessalonians where Paul speaks of the rapture of the whole church.
Phillip is raptured , that is snatched away by force suddenly without anyone knowing that it would happen. Phillip is raptured -caught away from the water and carried away suddenly by force to a city known as Azotus which is about 30 miles away from the location where Phillip baptized the eunuch . Phillip and the eunuch were in the water close enough together for Phillip to touch the eunuch and in a moment , in a split second as they come up out of the water Phillip is raptured -caught away -harpazo and taken to a city 30 miles away in a mere split second of time. Phillip did not take any means of human transportation , God snatched Phillip and placed him in a city 30 miles away .
This shows what happens at a rapture and that it was sudden and without notice and scripture did not teach that it would happen , but Almighty GOD said it happened in HIS WORD .
Matthew 24 does not speak at all in any way at all about the rapture of the church , rather it speaks that Jesus will send His angels to gather the remnant of those on earth to be gathered unto the rest of those of us that are already with Christ when Christ returns to earth
At the rapture of the Bride of Christ it is Christ Himself that calls us up into the heavens prior to the 6th seal in Revelation as it shows God is judging the earth and he promised us that he will remove us “out of the way” “out from ” that time of Gods judgments
I urge all to study this , I challenge all who disagree to study this ,
GOD’s WORD was written in Hebrew and Greek …NOT English it is only translated into English
The only reason there are denominations is because through time some men chose to interpret scripture in how they wanted to and not in the way it should have been .
ShalomIf the Gathering of the elect in Matthew 24:29-31 is the second installment of the rapture, then why didn’t Christ ever mention the first rapture? The first gathering are the Tares, the second gathering are the wheat not visa versa. Matthew 13:24-30,36-43.Shalon sir, mr president (Irvin Baxter) Mmmm!!! Wonderful. Really sir am confused about tribulation…is it here already with all this signs of the end time or it’s yet to come? And will that be after the Rapture? Pls can this area be clearify and what do we expect to see during the tribulation, is it God’s wrath poured on those left behind as written in the book of Revelation 16, The vials of wrath. I am a born again christain. Saved,baptised and holy spirit filled,speaks in tongue. All to the grace of God. I attenda bible believing church. The Redeemed Christian church of God. Can’t help being confused about this proceedings as I read the book of Revealation. It’s so fortunate for me that you are teaching these series at this time. I watch your programmes in Day star and Faithtv on the dstv. So l follow your programmes. Intact l wish to order you book titled ‘WHEN WILL THE RAPURE HAPPEN’ but unfortunately naira card in Nigeria is declined. I will have to ask a friend who lives in the UK to help out. Can’t wait to have that book in my hands…And thank you sir for God bringing you to the world at such a time like this. This week you are teaching the four count of the second coming of Jesus its chronological order as written in Revelation.I am so blessed. Surely if we hunger and thirst for righteousness we will be filled. God bless you sir. I await the reply to my questions sir.I really enjoyed this study on the rapture, however you really should have included 2nd Thessalonians 2:1-4 which destroys the pre-trib rapture and the doctrine of imminence. The pre-trib rapture doctrine is biblically indefensible and based on opinion and assumption. There’s not one passage of Scripture that clearly teaches the pre-trib view. It’s a doctrine that’s a product of the imagination.Thank you PastorWhat matters is believing in the Holy Lamb in whom our Father in Heaven has sent. With all your heart, mind, body and soul. Believe that he came to preach the “Truth, Good News, Kingdom of Heaven and what our Father in Heaven truly desires, in place of the corrupted interpretation of mankind. Believe that he lead by example of action backed by what he spoke about his Fathers will! Believe that he gave his life willingly, died and rose again on the third day and ascended to his Fathers dwelling place at his right side. Believe that he has authority to forgive all sins. Repent and change your mind, heart, body and soul to what pleases our Father by living in obedience. Die to the world but live in the Holy Lamb. Worship him in Truth and in Spirit as our bodies are a temple, not a building or anything created by mans hand! He will provide, protect and offer eternal salvation. Not always of the flesh, but forever your countenance! Do not judge harshly or wield power over over others. Please do not argue over matters that he himself told his disciples were none of their business! For arguing over and judging such matters is self righteous sin and not of what our Father desires.  Instead, pray for guidance, show lovingkindness, compassion, mercy, patience and all manner of righteousness. Wisdom will be revealed by those who search not only his word but seek to please him. He gives only what is needed and what he knows we each can handle. We are living for him and not of ourselves and doing so we are in the Kingdom of Heaven. He Proclaims, He will Provide, He will Save and He will be glorified, Him and Him alone!Revelation 22   18I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book; 19and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.Now think about how many of you didn’t read this passage concerning Revelations. It should scare you. They key point is that no one knows, so, unless you want God’s discipline against you, it’s suggested you keep your mouth shut and your keyboards tucked away.Hi everybody in Jesus our Lord, who love and adore Him truthfully. First, for Love, secondly, a love of the truth. With much prayer may receive God’s Word as a humble child; and for his Daddy to share His wonderful Bible and all the most awesome story’s both Old and New Testament.Those who with all humility, and meekness, and humble characters, that want to reflect Jesus to a world with so much confusion,need to be in full unity with our Lord to speak a love of the truth; and, will only touch the Heart of Jesus; when we all make the Lord of our lives foremost. He Jesus will come and spend time with us; and build a relationship with in us and us with Him, that He will live with us.A person that claims his way is right because of the years he may have spent putting the Bible together, needs to tread lightly, including myself. So many go overboard trying to make people see it from their point of view, then to let God’s Holy Word simply and easily come together naturally. Here is a good question for all of us. If there seems to be confusion and a subject mixed with other subjects, then it may be, it comes from the spirit of Antichrist, not the Holy Spirit. It would appear why so many would sooner not believe in God, as when they try, are confused with all the same subjects being told 20 different ways, no wonder some just say no thanks. Is God therefore the Author of confusion? Not so.
All the posts of boasting and calling people out to prove them wrong as I have read; have missed the whole purpose of truth, and replaced it no different to the very Church In Jerusalem, namely Judaism; His own people which, Jesus called a unholy blaspheming condemning system hypocritical; and His very own Jewish brotherian as you no, were rejected. They lost site of the very reason the Temple that Solomon built was in fact for. And only after their own selfish greed and pride, that they may show themselves a higher creed of people and chosen by God; simply addressing all others as lost souls did Jesus leave them and went to the Gentiles to spread His Word. They would not even humble themselves to learn from Jesus THE CHRIST, but handed Him over to the Roman state. Truly sad. Only unless they sought Him out secretly in the night, and away from the immediate counsel of the Sanhedrin, Such as Nicodemus, a wonderful man, as well Joseph of Arimathaea, these were of the same counsel of God’s Temple Jesus loved. A quick note God still loves His people and will save the house of Jacob. AmenNow, Jesus said, “Unless you become as the little children you shall in nowise enter the Kingdom of Heaven” Those in search for true gold will find it. Unfortunately, I was reluctant to write a truth to a subject for even the ones who left a short and brief sentence asking someone to make sense of it all. I was touched but not wanting to engage as; how would any understand a truth God has shown me? I would therefore be mixed in and blended with the same confusion.I have spent many hours reading pretty much the whole list of post’s, and all of your comments; as it took me over 12 hours; regarding the Rapture, the Tribulation, the Mark of the Beast, the 1st and 2nd Resurrections, the Millennium, the Coming Kingdom, the Pre and the non Rap, the Thief in the night, the Antichrist, the 144 Thousand. Etc. And there are many more subjects I could list.Truthfully, I remain a humble child of God as much as I can. However, if a non believer were to read all that I have read from your posts, again, he would be as confused as to who is right and/or who is not.First I want to point out that, to say you are lead by the Holy Spirit; but yet uncertain with sound doctrines; particularly on prophecy and the two Prophetic Book’s, namely, Daniel in the O/T, & Revelation In the N/T, many are indecisive. Most everyone on this site show not the love of our Beautiful Savior to others. Some correct some, while others bash others, and some want legit answers, humbly asking any to share light as they are new comers to Jesus Christ.If anyone truly love’s a true LOVE for the truth, why are there so many interpretations? Like I said, if I were a new comer, which one of you can lead me to a better way to study my Bible?Now if God Jesus, called His own church down; it is true when He said He is not a respecter of persons. Jesus love’s all who wait patiently for Him to teach His Word to those with a understanding, regardless of already a great knowledge of truth, received, but yet, very humble continually for more.So after spending so much time, I prayed that Jesus would move me to write to all of us as to a love for the truth. Please don’t get me wrong; to be a teacher of God’s Word is a wonderful gift to achieve. However, to assume above the wisdom of the Lord that your way is correct making yourself harden with a closed mind, need be careful, as some fall into the category of the Jewish scholars of Jesus day. What I am saying is don’t think for a second you are totally right,and have the truth, and readers should just see things the way you perceive light, and that’s that. With much speaking and writing and blaming, correcting people is no different from the Pharisees’ and the Sadducee’s. But not all, as some had loving words truthfully and I was moved. If Jesus would write to all of us, I’m sure He would say, It is not the scholar with wisdom, knowledge, and discernment, that shall be called His chosen; but the innocent, with a wonderful prayer life that have a relationship with Jesus, with a humble spirit; and a true heart to show the inquirer, or any as to why we are believers in God, that Jesus is the center of true joy in our life, with all adoration to our, “King of King’s and Lord of Lord’s” Nevertheless, even true teachers of the Word, have learned; by the Holy Spirit truly is above, but, at the same time, below. Jesus would rather spend time with a lowly seeker, with tears when he prays always asking Jesus to forgive him, then some one who boasts he knows the truth over and above even a true teacher who is correct in explaining the truth. I’m not saying teachers are not blessed as they are. But a child like character, Jesus in my own experience, I understood that it means a lot to Him as He loves a loving heart that spends time with Him; as I have mentioned above. Instead of becoming wise in your own ways, ask Jesus to show you the art of becoming the person He wants you to become, Ask Him questions even if you have the truth always maintain a child like attitude, He loves you more than you think. Personally, I had a reality check by the Holy Spirit, asking me, why do you love Jesus? Why do you have such a deep wanting for Bible Prophecy? Is it for yourself?, or, for the benefit work of the Lord that you desire to be a disciple of God? I needed much time reflecting on the answers I would return to Him. What God was asking me I learned Teaching His Word was more to me then remaining humble; as a lot of times I remain like most of you; as I was a person more excited to teach, but had really a lost sight of my relationship with Jesus. What I’m saying is, what good is building a house if there is not a solid foundation for you to build upon? Understanding that Jesus is the Rock and like it is said in the Word; those who fall upon this Rock will be saved; but if that Rock shall fall on us, it will crush those to pieces.When you take the office of the gospel to speak on behalf of the Creator of the universe; are you sure you are teaching the truth?  Those who teach need to be more careful as you may lead persons to doubt God by a selfish view that is wrong.With many years of study God has blessed me with the gifts I asked for. These consist of, Knowledge, wisdom, and discernment, in the understanding of the book of Revelation. Moreover, lately, I found myself wanting to trade all God has blessed me with, only to ask for Jesus to show me the art of being a child and teachable in humility, meekness, and humbleness. Lord God our Savior, may you help all of us to be the people you want us to become, that the beautiful Jesus may fully  keep us in His loving arms, Lord please forgive us for we have sinned before You and Heaven. Please make us to be ready for your soon return, and create in us a right heart and a contrite Spirit. Please show us your Word that we may build our faith upon truth. Thank you Father Daddy, for giving us Jesus, that we may be worthy to be called your children even, son’s and daughter’s of our Father. All this, I ask and pray in the name, above all names; the Lord Jesus Christ. I love you Daddy Amen. Please understand that Jesus through the Holy Spirit has blessed me to write unto you, a truth from my heart. God Bless, AmenHi everybody in Jesus our Lord, who love and adore Him truthfully.

Please understand that Jesus through the Holy Spirit has blessed me to write unto you, a truth from my heart. God Bless, AmenJesus name is a pagan lie.  Amen is a sun deity name just like the name Jesus is.  No one today has Yahweh’s Spirit infilling and no one is His without His Spirit.  When people had His Spirit, the elect needed no man to teach them, the Spirit taught them all things.  You sound like a Catholic to me.Gary W. Stanfield: Well first off; Jesus Christ was the Anointed one of Israel, Are you even a christian? You make no sense with your silly post with few words as if your trying to show me something, what are you trying to say? After the beautiful post I wrote inspired by the Holy Spirit that it may reflect open mindedness with Love and faith that you/others may have truth shown you. Moreover how do you come to the conclusion that I may be a Catholic? And Jesus name is pagan A? You Gary seem to be confused, not even professional. Why don’t you re-read my post and instead of being judgmental and assuming things that are not true, you might learn something. God BlessImmanuel was the birth given name of the baby that became Yahweh the Father in the Flesh, who inherited the Father’s name Yahweh and why Yahweh is the Messiah’s name.  The only name for salvation back then and soon to be during the 7 Year Peace Plan right after WW3.  No, I am not a Christian, I was raised in it, I know the lies it has perpetuated.  Only those who study outside of Christianity and for the real truth will find it.  The whole truth comes when Moses and Eliyah turn up in Jerusalem, when the Peace Plan goes into effect.  They will be killed midway through and that’s when Christianity will be made the One World Religion and the start of the Tribulation Period.  The Christians at that time will kill and persecute Yahweh’s elect.  No one has Yahweh’s Spirit infilling because salvation is not for today.  Holy Spirit actually comes from the Hindu religion like Chrishna does, Christ.Hey Irvin. I heard you on the Jim Baker Show. I had always been taught pre-trib, but recently have studied the Scriptures on my own and read Alan Kurschner’s book and Marv Rosenthal’s book on Pre-Wrath. Looking forward to delving into your stuff and learning more. Thank you for your ministry.Mr. Baxter:
I urge you to reconsider and pray for guidance about the timing of the rapture.  I believe you were taught correctly, and urge you to re-consider the many logical compelling Biblical arguments for a pre-tribulation rapture. Ask yourself the questions, if the rapture were to occur before the tribulation, what will become of your efforts to warn and help the Jews about the great tribulation?  What will happen to the money you collect and the plans you make?  Who will there be, to implement your plans? May the Lord bless and keep you.There are many of you in error. Many of you add and remove from the prophecy and God’s discipline is on you.Revelation 2218 For I testify unto every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.Baxter is right on when the catching up taking place at the very end of the Tribulation Period.  If you want total proof of this fact I sure can give it to you.  Where you won’t be deceived anymore about that subject.  It can be proved many different ways too.You are all false prophets. If Revelation 22 offends you, then you proved the statement true. It’s easy to find wolves – they’re always on the move, sheep on the other hand always stay still.Revelation 2218 For I testify unto every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.Thanks for taking my comment!  I  am a born-again Christian and somewhat concerned about the timing of the rapture for the following reasons. First, reading Revelation Ch. 4 does not  convince me that the entire body of Christ is called to heaven at that time but rather an angel is calling John to witness the future. Secondly, Ch. 7 seems to indicate the first sighting of any Christians in heaven. Thirdly, their arrival in heaven is after 6 seals and seemingly into tribulation.  Any clarification you can provide  would be greatly appreciated! Very respectfully, Melvin.The only thing that will matter is your personal faith.Your concern about rapture timing (see my earlier post from a day or so ago) is well founded and your seeing through the lie about Ch 4 convinces me the Holy Spirit is guiding your interpretation so persevere and steer away from trusting any preachers interpretation (or at least validate it against your own findings).Chapter 7 is an ‘interlude’ chapter depicting all faithful saints martyred (likely for not accepting the mark) from the midpoint of the ‘7’ upto the 6th seal signs – you’ll see in that chapter the indications that they were deprived of life’s essentials such as food , water and shelter because the mark would have enabled them to acquire these things. These aren’t raptured though as they are seen before the throne and not the clouds (they were martyred). The Rev 14 harvests ‘appear’ to indicate the rapture is before the bowls get underway but a close inspection shows that these 2 harvests are in depth depictions that occur between bowls 6 and 7 in Rev 16. Happy hunting and feel free to ask any more questions.
Because I see that you are a genuine truth seeker clearly being guided by the Holy Spirit I will share with you an understanding of the structure of the book (below). Realise also Rev is highly dependent on the OT so any attempt to understand it without appreciating the OT is futile and counterproductive.I highly recommend Tim Warners revelation preaching series at Answersinrevelation.org as he completely gets this point though I disagree with him about the identity of the Rev 12 woman and also he believes in a ‘Recapitulation’ of the seals trumpets and bowls but the structure clearly shows it is ‘progressive’. If you want a close fit teaching of every chapter I highly recommend him ..also you need to believe in a post trib rapture and have a premillenial stance, understand the importance of the Jews and the 1,000 year  kingdom being on earth or lots of Rev won’t make sense …anyway here is my structure gleaned from my own research:-SEALS 1 – 5 EVENTS STARTED SOON AFTER (POSSIBLY EVEN BEFORE ???)

CH 20-22: THE MILLENIUM, NEW HEAVENS & EARTH********************************************************************************************Apologies the ref to Eph 2:11 (seal of believers) should read Eph 1:13,14 insteadAny one who disputes seal 4 events as having been reached (or rather already STARTED) yet due to it APPARENTLY involving 1/4 of the worlds POPULATION being wiped out consider the following:-Firstly in Rev 67 When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 8 I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the EARTH to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earthNow contrast this with Rev 913 The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God. 14 It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 15 And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of MANKIND. 16 The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.Please spot the subtle but significant difference in that when MANKIND is intended it is explicitly stated so. Therefore it is my contention that seal 4 refers to % area of the earth NOT population and note that this does not contradict  Zech 6I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze. 2 The first chariot had red horses, the second black, 3 the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful. 4 I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?”5 The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits[a] of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world. 6 The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west,[b] and the one with the DAPPLED horses toward the SOUTH.7 When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth.Again SOUTH (i.e. land areas south of Israel) – eg Africa (NB Africa is clearly not the entirety of the South) – so again that supports the 1/4 in Rev 6 referring to land area. I don’t think anyone can dispute that Africa has its fair share of famine and wild beasts for example.The point about seals 1-5 events is that (unless someone can clearly prove otherwise) they have already been reached (or rather started) and their effect will simply intensify in frequency, scope and magnitude as the end approaches (like contractions in child birth to used the analogy Jesus used in Matt 24:8  5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the BEGINNING OF BIRTH PAINS.). NB also that the ‘little longer’ the martyrs were to wait for justice in seal 5 can mean quite a long time in our terms – clearly martyrs have been around ever since the blood of Abel was shed – Also the Greek translation (strongs G4969) shows they weren’t exclusively specifically beheaded but just generally suffered a painful or violent death.Also seal 1 (white horse which gets released to the West acc. to Zech.) isn’t boxed exclusively into Daniels 70th week as that is simply religious deception (eg false christs , false prophets) which has been around for quite a while too and growing.  As I see it the only two seals bound EXCLUSIVELY by Daniels 70th week and indeed more specifically within the 2nd half (Great Trib) are the 6th and 7th seal.  My point is:We need to break out of the long held immovable paradigm that the whole of the end times is confined EXCLUSIVELY to a 7 year block of time in the future – it simply suits dispensationalist minds that love to compartmentalise everything and have everything neatly organised and boxed.Think about why the devil might want to push everything into the future…..to cause us to drop our guard in the present !Kev: the first 6 seals have been opened the 7th seal has not and for the record a half an hour is literally 7 days given the 1 day = 1 year principal.Hi….seal 6 must come AFTER the abom of desol. Which occurs at the midpoint of the ‘7’ (see Matt 24 chronology esp v29 sixth seal signs and EARLIER abom of desol. Also seals 1-5 have been INITIATED and will reach their peak in the final week.Joseph…if you put the following 3 scriptures together you cannot help but place the 6th seal somewhere in the 2nd half of Daniels week. Also as I see it there is no time ‘equation’…Rev has a mix of time periods intended to be precisely translated and other times appear such as ‘1 hour’ which are simply meant to indicate a short but undefined period of time. My personal belief about the 1/2 hour at
the 7th seal is simply that that is how long it felt (in real time) like to John.The 3 scriptures are:Rev 6:12
12 I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,Matt 24
15 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’[a] spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand—
…………………………………
29 “Immediately after the distress of those days“‘the sun will be darkened,
    and the moon will not give its light;
the stars will fall from the sky,
    and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’[b]Daniel 9
27 He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’[h] In the MIDDLE OF THE SEVEN’[i] he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple[j] he will set up an ABOMNATION THAT CAUSES DESOLATION,Further to the above….seal 5 does not specifically indicate beheading but Rev 20 (tribulation martyrs) does . The Greek word behind seal 5 is a more general word implying a painful or violent death. This is one reason why I don’t consider the seal 5 martyrs to be tribulation martyrs but rather the former group seem to be a historical group of martyrs.just spotted this error of mine….seal 5 (chap 6 – esfagmenwn

G4969ones-having-been-slain) does not specifically indicate beheading but Rev 20 (tribulation martyrs – pepelekismenwn

G3990
vp Perf Pas Gen Pl m
ones-HAVING-been-HATCHETED) does . The Greek word behind seal 5 is a more general word implying a painful or violent death. This is one reason why I don’t consider the seal 5 martyrs (that is to say… the ones praying for justice) to be tribulation martyrs but rather the former group seem to be a historical group of martyrs – though that is by no means absolutely certain.Nothing in the seal 5 description definitively ‘places it’ in the great trib window:-9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 10 They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” 11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters,[e] were killed just as they had been.…though the ‘full number’ is clearly something that will be COMPLETED during the great tribApologies also just realised I should have indicated that the two witnesses must arrive on the scene PRIOR AND CLOSE to the midpoint and end their 1,260 day ministry PRIOR AND CLOSE to the end of the GT…I have given an explanation of this timeline in the ‘endtime who are the two witnesses’ blogKev: The first 4 seals started in 27 AD to 95 AD Jesus established His church depicted as the Rider on the white horse, the second seal the rider on the red horse rules until 95 AD to 321 AD depicting the colors of the Roman Empire, notice color changes mean much in Bible prophecy. The third seal was open and a black horse holding a set of balance’s. Black depicting the church that Jesus stated with His Apostles, again depicted as the white purity as solid sound doctrine. So in this case the church has lost more than 50% and is a Black time, and a dark time, truth is not being taught rather tradition, two balances indicate the state of truth is being kept but only darkness is shrouded in dark traditional times.This went from 321 AD to 538 AD.The fourth rider and most hideous is the pale horse and his rider was hell and death followed him. Depicted as the time the truth was completely pale sick and teachings Jesus started are it seems shrouded in it dying away as so many fall so sick they can not comprehend any doctrine. This rider was from 538 AD to 1798 A D Yes well over a 1000 years, the truth remained  sick. Who do you think this time frame represents? In your History if you done your home work in the year 538 AD the Roman Empire politically could not hold there political power no longer. So the last Cesar Justinian sent his general berthiaye into Rome and took the good bishop ceased his throne and Justinian set up a Roman soldier called Sylvester as the first pope and a puppet to still keep the Roman Empire alive.
Dose it ever make you wonder why the Roman Catholic Church in fact are called this? Well very simple, the Roman Catholic Church derived by the ruins of political Rome. Hence The Roman Catholics; this church system brought all its pagan gods from Rome and intermingled truth and error together so one can not see the truth to their insane corrupt control over the political Roman rules and their gods as apposed to the true God.                                   One only needs to study why the dark ages in fact were called the dark ages. The Roman Catholic church is responsible for over 250,000,000 souls that were killed. Any caught with a Bible, their hands would be cut off. they tortured many to get them to speak as to were are the rest hiding out so they can find them and kill them. A horrible time well depicted as a sick horse. And depicting the bluebonic plague 15th century killed so many remember death and hell followed this rider,     God’s once upon a time 500 year back church has been in total sickness from a rider on the White Horse as the true church.                                                                                                      Now the 5th seal is opened, this seal represents the souls that had gone through this tribulation hour called the Dark ages and are the saints; who scream out, when will are blood be avenged over those who killed us? And God remarked rest yet a little while until your fellow brother-in are killed as you were, should be fulfilled.                                             Now this 6th seal has also been opened, this how God puts it in perspective for us. Notice the order God calls these four event and the dates line up as well confining this true. When He had opened the 6th seal there was a great earth quake this in fact came in the year 1755 AD In Lisbon Portugal a massive earth quake that devastated everything then few hours later a 900 foot wave rushed to land and went inland for miles. Any ways to this day no earth quake has ever come close and no where near this day.                                                                                                  Now the next part notice the date. “May 19th 1780, brought a remarkable darkening of the sun and moon” “For hours an intense darkness covered all of New England” “When night time came the darkness became more terrifying” “Finally, after midnight the darkness went away, and a blood red moon appeared”                                                “Then in November, 1833, an astounding meteoric shower, the most intense ever recorded, covered nearly the whole North American continent” So lets sum it up 1) Earth quake 2) Darkening of the sun 3) Followed by a blood red moon 4) The stars fall from Heaven not like an ordinary shower event; but like the prophecy said, the stars will fall from one point in the sky “like a fig tree casteth her untimely figs”Seal 6 complete. 4 Catastrophic events that in the order Jesus say’s they would take place see these dates again 1755,earth quake, 1780 Dark day sun is up and by 10 am, the sun mysteriously with holds its light well to the next day, but that same night the moon was a bright eerie blood red disc a blood moon you would need to see if you were alive then. The last one is 1833 AD the meteoric shower fell as the prophecy mentioned and scientists are still baffled as to how to enplane this show lasting for few hours, from one point in the sky. dates confirm their order again Kev. And God is a God of order if we proved the 6 seals were in fact opened then the first 5 needed to come first.
Now the 7th Seal in Revelation Ch. 8:1 still needs to be opened. But what I will say is, if you know the equation, a day represents a year principal in Bible prophecy then I figured out the space of an half hour as the 7th and final seal, ads up to precisely “ONE WEEK”   still unsure to this one week and when God Jesus will open it still a future thing but it will be understood when He does open it. May God Bless you Kev.When the Book of “The Revelation of Jesus the Christ”  original title of this book was written about
90 A.D. it would be difficult to believe the first seal started in 27 A.D. .
The book of Luke written around the year 40 A.D.  After the first line in this post I stopped reading it 🙂Apologies…just remembered two other things I disagree with Tim Warner on:-1) He says the 2 witnesses ministry is in the 1st half of Daniels 70th week whereas I have indicated that their timeline is slightly offset of the 2ND half of the week.2) He doesn’t realise that the ‘7th king’ of Rev 17:10 was Adolf Hitler. He thinks the 7th king hasn’t appeared yet !Other than these things I don’t recall disagreeing with him on much else.sorry….also he thinks that the 2 witnesses ministry will be a global ministry (via TV) rather than simply to the Jews. He also thinks that they will warn Christians (in addition to the Jews) where to flee to at the abomination of desolation.All this talk is silly. It doesn’t matter when the rapture or second coming is. The reference to a thief in the night…is non believers not knowing. It won’t matter to believers because you are already a follower of Christ. As a believer you are already saved. You don’t need to read every publication out there to understand rather you are a believer or not. If it’s in question then you are CLEARLY not a believer. I hope I am making sense…it is late and I’m sleepy.Rapture timing is not simply an intellectual exercise it is CRITICAL information because on it rests whether or not we believers will go straight into Daniels 70th week or be whisked away before it starts. Knowledge of the timing has many ramifications which is why the devil has made it so popular eg why need to learn about the end times if we’ll be outta here ? Not knowing about the end times will make is totally mentally , spiritually and emotionally unprepared for when we surely WILL enter that week. We will then end up accepting antichrist as Christ because we didn’t heed Jesus Matt 24 warning about not responding when someone tells us where to find Christ. We will end up being deceived by false teachers when Jesus in Matt 24 said ‘Take care that no man deceive you’.2 TIM 4
3 For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather round them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.Hi Irvin BaxterI would like to know whether the church will go to heaven when it’s caught up or it will meet the Lord in the sky and come back with Him to the earth same time? I’ve been taught all my life that the church will go to heaven during rapture according to John 14:2-3 which says ” In my Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. Please kindly elaborate, Thank you. I REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS!You might get a reply from the moderator but not likely Irvin. The answer as per Rev 16:15 is that rapture occurs prior to the 7th bowl global disaster involving cities collapsing and 100lb hailstones – we simply have to be outta here before that one. The other judgments (trumpets and bowls) are more focussed / limited in scope – the trumpets have 1/3 coverage and the bowls are directed at the beast and his followers. We intercept Jesus on his descent so we come down to earth with Him soon after to rule and reign (note: we’ll still technically be ‘with Him’ – but on earth rather than heaven). Statistically though if you’re not caught up in the great apostasy – which my understanding shows will reach its height at the midpoint of the 7 when the RCCs religious union gets ousted by the beast who supports its rule for 3.5 years and then turns tail – you’d be likely be martyred for not accepting the mark. The rapture group will be a small remnant of believers so don’t pin your hopes on being in that group.As well as the RCCs false revival/union involving many apostate protestants and Jews (‘daughter harlots’) and other world religions (‘abominations of the earth’) – this is fomenting already ! – this is what happens when you try to boost ‘unity’ and numbers at any cost (even critical doctrinal truth) another thing to look out for during the 1st half of the week will be a two state Israel where Israel and Palestine share the land by means of the ‘firm covenant’ . In particular Jerusalem will be divided between the two and the Dome of the Rock will sit side by side a newly built 3rd temple (this is geometrically possible and it is understood that the Dome doesn’t actually sit where the 2nd temple sat) where the beast will proclaim himself God – this land sharing will be a part (not the whole) of the great apostasy.JOEL 3
[a]‘In those days and at that time,
    when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
2 I will gather all nations
    and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.[b]
There I will put them on trial
    for what they did to my inheritance, my people Israel,
because they scattered my people among the nations
    and DIVIDED UP MY LAND.This middle eastern peace and peace among the worlds religions will make for the longed for ‘world peace’ but it will come at a price.Hi Kev Like Moses, their were in his day 10 plagues. As long as the blood of the Lamb was marked on the doors, the first born did not die; which means God’s hand protected them from the death angel.Same in our day their are 7 last plagues, which means if we have accepted Jesus Christ in our hearts we have His blood as a covering on the door post of our hearts.At Jesus second coming it will be seen by all every eye shall see Him. At this time the 1st resurrection takes place then we who are alive will go up caught up into the clouds. Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you will be also. The wicked who have died remain in their graves at which point the wicked who are alive shall be killed by the brightness of His coming. Jeremiah 4: 23-28 ex-planes the condition of the earth after God’s chosen are removed. The earth is desolate for 1000 years. Then all the saints return with God and the New Jerusalem which sets on the old Temple mount; then the second resurrection takes place. After they are shown the great controversy every knee shall bow declaring Jesus as King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Thereafter fire falls from the heavens also the earth brakes up spewing firer engulfing the whole earth. This is the second death; after the firers have burned up sin and sinners the earth is made new by Jesus Isaiah 66: 22,23 and God shall write His Law upon our hearts and in our minds.This is Scripture and truth…Some may ask with regard to my comment “the RCCs religious union gets ousted by the beast who supports its rule for 3.5 years and then turns tail” how do I know the former will rule before the midpoint ? It’s simple deduction:-The first thing we know is that the antichrist beast begins its rule at the midpoint (abomination of desolation) which he is fully revealed for who he is (Rev 13)Next look at Rev 17 (now bear in mind that since this is all about Mystery Babylon then it is not strictly bounded by the ongoing chronology relating to the seals , trumpets and bowls). If you look at Rev 17 you see that this woman RIDES the same beast as that in Rev 13 and it says:-Rev 17
3 Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns…….12 ‘The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have NOT YET received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. (ie they don’t have crowns YET !!)However when you look at the reign of the same beast (as that ridden by the woman of Rev 17) which begins at the abomination of desolation (ie after Michael casts satan to earth in Rev 12) you see :Rev 13 The dragon[a] stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with TEN CROWNS on its horns…..So the scene described in Rev 17:12 (the “NOT YET”) must denote a time PRIOR to the events of Rev 13 (rule of the beast)ie the woman is effectively in charge PRE-MIDPOINT with the beast waiting in the wings !! This might be a bit confusing to some as effectively a later chapter in Rev (ie 17) is depicting an event occurring EARLIER IN TIME than something depicted in an EARLIER chapter ie Rev (13).It helps to keep in mind that:
overall the chronology of the seals, bowls and trumpets is intact however the book is not averse to ‘interlude’ chapters which describe key events and players going as far back in time as necessary WITHIN THOSE CHAPTERS to provide a full appreciation of those events and players.apologies….and also the woman is no longer seen here (in Rev 13) sitting on the beast…..…the beast will demand to be the ONLY object of worship from the midpoint onwards …how could he therefore tolerate any longer an alliance of the worlds religions ? The alliance will have served its purpose and then be put to one side. The alliance seems likely to be the way the world will be groomed to have a common object/focus/system of worship which will fall neatly into becoming worship of a single figure esp when everyones day to day livelihood , life and liberty depends on it with everyone !To most it will seem like the ‘no brainer’ choice to worship him !Apologies …this also assumes you realise that ‘Mystery Babylon’ is the Roman Catholic Church….The similarity in the Ark account is accurate but the were protected and still endured the flood unharmed. They never left the earth. You may ask why? They still had work to do. Work out you faith with fear and trembling.The Ark account is not a rapture , not related to it either . The reason some bring it up is simply to note “the times of Noah and the times of Lot” when evil ran rampant on earth as it is happening today. The rapture is an event that “snatches away” believers , that is how the word rapture is defined literally. Harpazo is the original Greek word , First a person has to understand “what” a rapture is , then “why” there is a need for it before you can discern “when” . Jesus did say he went to prepare a place for us and would return to take us there , after this there will be more people who “Only Then Afterward” believe the scripture and then accept Jesus as savoir. It matters not if a current believer does not believe this and believes they will go through the Great Trib cause they will not , they will go when the others do , as Paul declared when he spoke of the rapture he said “Comfort one another with these words”K not so Luke: Study Matthew 24: 26-28 even if we go through the tribulation those who don’t receive the mark of the beast will be protected from the 7 last Plagues; no different from the Hebrews Moses took out of Egypt after the 10 last plagues. In our day we shall leave spiritual Egypt “the earth” to the promised land Heaven and it takes place after the 7 last plagues. God is the same yesterday today and forevermore. The formula remains the same if you will.Hi Joseph,Matthew 24:26-28King James Version (KJV)26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
 I do not see any mention of any protection of anything in those verses as it only states that when Jesus comes back to earth to establish His Kingdom on earth that it will be such a great event that everyone across the earth will see it , with advanced technology today it would be broadcast on smart phones , TV,and the internet . I appreciate your opinion but it does not match with the scripture you provide and I see no scripture that states  that it has to happen after the last 7 plagues , would you please provide scripture ?Agreed. There is a definite stony silence generally in end times prophetic literature about the great and final end time witness of the saints. For obvious reasons the devil wants to suppress this – he’d rather us become lethargic and indifferent.
There is an established correlation between persecution and harvest. Endtimepilgrim on line emphasises this end times witness a lot (though there a number of things on his site I don’t agree with he is generally on the ball).Joel 2
28 “And afterward,
    I will pour out my Spirit on all people.
Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
    your old men will dream dreams,
    your young men will see visions.
29 Even on my servants, both men and women,
    I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
30 I will show wonders in the heavens
    and on the earth,
    blood and fire and billows of smoke.
31 The sun will be turned to darkness
    and the moon to blood
    before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
32 And everyone who calls
    on the name of the Lord will be saved;In the above you see two references to a time of great Holy Spirit outpouring and harvest sandwiching the sixth seal signs in the heavens. This is a world away from the Holy Spirit (claimed by some to be The Restrainer) being removed before the final 7 years. Yes Peter quoted it in Acts as applying to his time but as is so often the case in prophecy there is a ‘dual’ fulfilment (i.e. the foreshadowing and the final fulfilment).
Imagine how when the 7th seal judgments start there’s going to be plenty need for divine healing as a precursor to open ears for salvation.
Even upto the time of the 5th bowl in Rev 16 we see evidence of repentance opportunity but people too hardened to accept it.There is a lot of immediate talk about a great revival in the short term but I can’t help feeling that that one will only culminate in the false revival of the global apostate religious union which which will culminate in Antichrists arrival at the midpoint. Postmillenialism / dominionism is all about having the church take over the world ready to hand over to Christ – unfortunately it will not be the real one ! Be wary of Christian movements with a militant edge – so far from Jesus’ approach !Tchild I also would like to add,
Rev 19 clearly speaks of the Marriage Supper of the Lamb and all the saints following Him into the great battle of Armageddon. This supper takes place after the rapture and before His second coming.Right. So, in order for there to be a marriage supper and his SAINTS to come with him in armageddon, we have to be there!The other thing I wanted to point out is that Jesus said his coming will be like a thief in the night. If we go through the tribulation, his coming will not be like a thief in the night because through revelations we can see what happens next.  Yes, Noah, Lot and the others were here and spared but they lived in another time. They had to be there for the generations who came after them. The time when the anti-christ here is to bring JEWS and UNBELIEVERS to believe in Jesus. The Church isn’t mentioned again in revelations after Chapter 3. The REMNANT of believers that it talks about after is the NEW BELIEVERS that are in the tribulation who were not SPARED because there were not believers when he came for US. Those of this group who escape martyrdom will be the believing godly remnant on the earth when the Lord returns with His church from heaven to establish His millennial kingdom. In view of these facts, it is impossible to make the translation(rapture) of the church and the establishment of the millennial kingdom simultaneous. The millennial kingdom Christ establishes will be indwelt by both glorified and unglorified believers. Those who are glorified are the previously Raptured (before Tribulation) “Bride of Christ” and will know life in both heaven and earth, and those who remain unglorified are those who accept Jesus during Tribulation and live to see the Second Coming. They will enter into the Millennial Reign as flesh and blood people and will live only on earth. The unglorified believers will still eat meals, plant crops, cook, work, and depend on public services. The glorified and unglorified will mingle together. Christ, after He was glorified, still mingled with His disciples (Luke 24:33-43), and Abraham and Sarah dined with angels (Genesis 18:1-10).
Believers who survive the Tribulation will be brought into the kingdom in their earthly bodies. There will be no change for them. They are the ones who will bear children in Christ’s earthly kingdom (Isaiah 11:8; 65:20). And those children will bear the offspring who rebel against Christ at the end of the millennial kingdom (Revelation 20:7-9).In our glorified bodies, we–like angels–will be able to go wherever we want to. Our bodies will be fit for both earth and heaven. We will be able to ascend to or descend (Revelation 21:2).The Glorified BodyLet’s pause for a moment and examine what our glorified bodies will be like. In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul reveals that the glorified body will be “imperishable” and “immortal.” It will be raised in “glory and power” and will be spirit controlled, rather than controlled by the flesh (1 Corinthians 15:42-44, 52-54). In Philippians 3:21 Paul further states that the glorified bodies which will be given to believers will be like the body that Jesus had after His resurrection.Think about that for a moment. Jesus had a tangible body that could be touched and recognised (Luke 24:41-43 and John 20:27-28). It was body very similar to the bodies we have now, and yet it was also very different. It could pass through a wall into a locked room (John 20:26), and it could move about from one place to another instantly (Luke 24:30-36).Please consider that 2 Thessalonians  2:6-8 states that the lawless one will not be revealed until he that now letteth (restrains) is taken out of the way.  This is the rapture, the removing of the church empowered by the indwelling Holy Spirit.  Jesus said The gates of hell will not prevail against my Church.  Matthew 24:31 He will send his angels … and they will gather his elect from one end of the HEAVENS to the other.  The raptured saints are in heaven.Yes. In order for the “anti-christ” to be revealed, the church has to go. In order for there to be the kind of “chaos” and tribulation that there will be, God’s people has to leave. As long as we are here, there can be no time like the tribulation period. It seems most logical to believe that His program for the present age will be finished before God resumes His announced program for Israel in the tribulation. In confirmation of this, there is no reference to the church as the body and bride of Christ in any of the tribulation passages. Believers in the tribulation are referred to only by general terms such as saints and the elect—terms used for believers all through the Bible. Thus in Revelation, chapters 4-19, describing the tribulation, there is no mention of the church as a body of believers. By contrast, Revelation, chapters 2-3, mentions the church many times. 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12 talks about how God (dwelling in the church) will be removed before the anit-christ can come on the scene.Kari….there are a number of errors in your post:-1) If you look in 2 Thessalonians you’ll see that what precedes the man of lawlessness being revealed is the APOSTASY. In other words the church doesn’t have to physically leave earth it just has to become apostate (ie depart from the faith and its fundamental teachings). The OT is rife with examples where the disobedience of God’s people caused His protection (from Satan) to be lifted. 2) I’ve explained before that non mention of church means NOTHING. Saints are mentioned because they will, due to the mark, be forced to be more separate, invisible and underground. Many in the church will have become apostate and the only organized visible ‘church’ will be the unholy gloabal religious alliance spearheaded by the Catholic church (pope). 3) 2 Thess 2 does NOT say God will be removed – if there’s a capital ‘H’ in ‘He’ then someone has presumptuously (theological bias) translated it as such – the Greek would have given no indication that God was being referred to.
Referring also to Rev 12 and Daniel 11/12 should leave you in no doubt that the Restrainer is indeed a ‘he’ but is in fact the Archangel Michael (the protector of Gods people) when he casts Satan to earth at the abomination of desolation so allowing  persecution to be released on Gods people.  Michaels protection/restraining is lifted because of the increase of lawlessness (the secret of lawlessness) amongst the people of God (Jews AND Christians).Hi everybody, there is no such thing as a secret rapture. Jesus said beware if they say he in the desert go not forth; if they say he is in the SECRET CHAMBERS, believe it not. Notice it says even the word Secret don’t believe how much more plane do we need it? Matthew 24: 26, and just for the record read on about Jesus 2nd coming in context to chapter 24.Of course there is no secret rapture / it has been in scripture all along , It will happen to the church just as it happened to Phillip in the Book of Acts when he and the eunuch stopped to be baptized only the church will go to heaven , it is imminent meaning it could happen at any time being unannounced just as it was with PhillipHarpazo: you will not find one single verse to support your theory nor back a inconclusive theory that is biblical.
Study again and find just one good verse to your secret rapture belief; Find me that magical verse, only one. God be with you..Hello Joseph !,
How are you ?  I would like to show you how and where you can learn more about this topic , it is very extensive and as such I cannot post it all here but I can show you things to research and you will see it for yourself if you wish.  first we should examine the word rapture so here’s something you can research and find literally thousands of sources to verify it.
Harpazo is the original Greek word in scripture which was translated into Latin as raperium , rapiemur . rapio and then translated into English as rapture , they all mean the same thing referring to the sudden unexpected snatching away, catching away ,caught away suddenly by force and taken to another location
St. Jerome translated the Geek verb harpazo that Paul uses in 1 Thess  4:17  into the latin verb rapiemur back in about the year 400 and later on that latin verb was translated into the English as “caught up” or “caught away”  1 Thess  4:17 ” Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.”
In verse 18 we are to take comfort with the words he is teaching
Book of Acts 8:34-40
38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
40 But Philip was found at Azotus:
The story of Phillip baptism of the eunuch , read all verses 34-40 and notice that the words “caught away” in verse 39 are in the Greek writing of Acts 8:39 is Harpazo – identically exactly the very same word used in Thessalonians where Paul speaks of the rapture of the whole church.
in a split second as they come up out of the water Phillip is raptured -caught away -harpazo and taken to a city 30 miles away in a mere split second of time. Phillip did not take any means of human transportation , God snatched Phillip and placed him in a city 30 miles away .
This shows what happens at a rapture and that it was sudden and without notice and scripture did not teach that it would happen , but Almighty GOD said it happened in HIS WORD .
When I think of a secret anything it brings to mind something to be kept away from peoples knowledge as in to hide it , but clearly there are concise verbiage of a rapture as in a snatching away of the people who have chosen to follow Christ .

MaranathaMaranatha: God be with you, The teaching of the Secret Rapture, the 7 year Tribulation, the political Antichrist to come after 3.5 years all fit together as a puzzle; however, they are not in harmony with Scripture. Yes I prayed that God would give me the absolute truth as to prophecy. We will go through everything until the end of the plagues. How many nights I wished the Secret Rapture as a lot of you believe was true. But I know things that will not settle easy with anyone fore that matter. Love you Daddy Abba..Hello Joseph !,

MaranathaYve: Hey how are you? really enjoyed your post of May 13th 2016.
Very inspiring and to the point. Yes about the Sabbath, I will also add that the Sabbath day is in fact the true standard of true worship. Also, ABBA means Daddy our Heavenly Father has put His name within the word SABBATH. Please don’t be offended as I’m sure many will take this the wrong way seeing that I make mention of God’s Covenant; particularly the 4th Command on worshiping.
Malachi 4: 4-6 say’s “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord”
But verse 4 is what Elijah’s brings to the forefront “The TEN COMMANDMENTS” This would explain why they “the two witnesses” are more hated then loved, and/or accepted as God’s prophets.
The two most easily understood subjects in the Word of God, are but misunderstood placing upon these subjects as if God has not instructed us in His Word regarding the truth. So many are the conclusions of people that the “It Is Written” in plain site are as if encrypted. One is the state of the dead, and the other, the day of worship. Why? because the great controversy between Jesus and the devil is about who the true God is. That would only suggest their is one method to true worship. 1) The true way and on a specified day we Honor the true God. To follow any other would be a counterfeit system of worship; derived by paganism revolving around a satanic influence religion; but accepted and not shunned, based on compromise; not saying God does not accept your worshiping of Him, but it’s what we don’t see behind the scenes, as to the truth to the matter on worship.
Remember why Elijah the prophet of Carmel was sent to king Ahab and all to witness. He was to overturn the gods of Baal. He told Ahab that two alters should be constructed and an offering placed upon both alters; and the God to answer by consuming the alter and sacrifice by fire would be THE GOD of all. The story say’s, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Israel, answered from Heaven above, and God consumed Elijah’s alter and the sacrifice and fire came down even licked up 3 of the 4 barrels of water he poured on the sacrifice and filling the trench full. Making it even harder for fire to consume. There is nothing to hard for our Lord to do.
This same method would be used in our day by the spirit of Elijah. Like John the Baptist was called Elijah by Jesus also the greatest of prophets nevertheless said by Jesus he who is greatest is the least in His kingdom as God is not a respecter of persons.
So my point is this, If we want to start understanding the Mark of the beast and his number; and how to get the victory over this time, we need, 1) The KJV, 2) The secret rapture theory is a lie from the devil, and is meant to deceive, so rightfully put it far from us. 3) Bring the original TEN COMMANDMENTS God gave to Moses on Mt. Sinai back; not the ones that were altered by the Roman Catholic Church during the middle ages, as this was the plan the devil needed, on his side, by convincing the world or most Christendom, that the Ten Commandments were done away within God’s Word. In so many books and verses in the Bible are plain truth written so wonderfully as to the perfect Law; but why has it taken the world captive to believe anything less? It is preached everywhere that we are now under grace and not Law. So does that mean His Law is ineffective if by grace? God forbid, those justified by faith and saved by grace; is true, but why and who said we can’t have both Law and grace, and justification between the two is measured as to love for the truth and our knowledge of Scripture. Moreover, I do believe grace is for those with beautiful hearts who might have never had the chance to read themselves the truth and might of been rejected by men who deceived them.
Yes God is a loving merciful God. But what we forget about is, God has to put up with this world on a daily basis with what go’s on everyday. Could you imagine what all Heaven see’s they have to look away I’m sure. If you being a child of God were to see the world everyday, many would scream at the injustice done. What I’m saying is God has every reason to be angry. He regretted making man when He had no choice to flood the world as the increasing daily hatred was ever increasing; same with Sodom and Gomorrah, when evil was so bad God destroyed the cities by firer. The Word of God say’s He is a consuming fire. Jesus said not peace but a sword I send. Jesus is coming soon not this time as the humble sacrifice to die, but as “King of King’s and Lord of Lord’s” to render in full recompense His vengeance upon the wicked and evil that walk not after the true will of the Lord. May God Bless us all and give light to truth and sound doctrine. Do not compromise if not sure, read and re- read His Holy Word until it fits God’s plan for all of us, not what your church teaches, but in the volume of the most amazing book ever “It Is Written”
                                                                                Amen                                            Joseph ZavagliaBecause you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. – Rev.3:10
“But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing [surfeiting (overindulgence)-YLT], drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that Day come on you suddenly like a trap. 35For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.36Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass(end time events and tribulation), and to stand before the Son of Man.”-Luke 21:34-36. Note that some will be worthy to escape and then stand before the Son of Man (Christ Jesus), so it’s not just being in refuge until the storm passes over, it is to be taken to stand before Christ and be with Him.
“to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.” – 1Thess.1:10. “So let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and sober/self-controlled… for God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him.” – 1 Thess.5:6,9-10
 but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance … 9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. – Rom.5:3,9.
So he said to me, “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 15 Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them. 16 They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any heat; 17 for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”- Rev.7:9-17These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb(v.14). These are clearly Christians – saints in Christ. They are multitudes from all nations and peoples, so they have to be Christians and are explicitly not just Jews. This scene is clearly prior to the trumpet judgments including the wrath of the Lamb and before the bowl judgments, the wrath of God. It is not definitive as to when they have arrived before the throne; Revelation does not indicate when. This is entirely consistent with other scriptures cited that the saints in Christ are not appointed to wrath. This scene is well before the mid-trib point between the trumpet judgments and the bowl judgments.To Kev: and all blessings. I will carry on, and reiterate the teachings on subjects not Biblical and the deadly repercussions if not in harmony to sound doctrine to a certain extent. But first, I don’t want anyone to get this idea that I write a lot and judge others, not so. I am someone who loves the Lord as you do. If you’re reading this please let me know your thoughts below.
       So back to seeing things from another angle as opposed to the most accepted modern day popular theories. What I’m saying is look at it this way, including myself, if we believe truth is what our church, our friends, our heritage, our spouse, believes is not how we should approach God and His word. And is quite normal to do so, as most of us came from this mind set, I believed what I was told for the longest time. Regardless, God does not judge as most think. He knows us better than we may know ourselves. However, how far we want to go down the rabbit hole of knowledge with the Lord, He leaves up to us as He gives us the free will. Essentially, some want the full meal deal and discover that if we all had gone further down, the surface gold we once were satisfied with, was just not enough; but going deeper we realize how come we never did this sooner, especially when new truth floods into you as a well of living waters spring up inside you as a fountain of eternal waters. What a beautiful God we have just knowing that Jesus came down, yes God himself, to die in our place. Yes Jesus took the responsibility because God made us after His own image, after His likeness, and could not fathom the thought He would lose us if He had never came down. What greater love is there that One would give His life that you and I may live? We can’t begin to measure the height, width, and length this kind of love truly is. My Jesus thank you Lord.
        Carrying on, others satisfy themselves when we give our life to God and start reading His Manuel, but without our heart, we overlook otherwise important verses the Holy Spirit really wants to show us. The Holy Bible; nevertheless, becomes our journey to great enlightenment. And to some who are new Christians on this page, I couldn’t imagine how overwhelmed you might be with all these posts. (YouTube) One is saying this, the other is saying that, and before you know it there are 20 different ways to look at an interpretation on subjects we take for granted. These subjects needing more Scripture references namely, prophetic prophecy and proper interpretation as to symbolic language that; defiantly require a term called “Covenant Theology”, or if you like, cross referencing. This entitles prayer, patience, meditating, and a desire for the absolute truth. What covenant theology, means is we use the complete Bible all 66 books. For example, I have been a Christian for over 25 years and some of the truth I found only may have come the other day. My point is when we give our life to the Lord it is a life journey that He begins with us; and we grow spiritually; in some cases this could be over a life time. We should never feed the notion that if we can’t get it right the first few times, we should give up. If your reading this and that’s how you feel right now, I want to reassure you Jesus will not give up on you go to Him always He is with you right now, He loves you beloved. Jesus will never forsake you nor I; if your falling lots, continue to stay close to Him nevertheless, stand, if you get knocked down, stand, stand, stand. It’s not by our strength or power; not so, but by His Spirit. Fight for your right to exist, because, He is still in love with you, and He will wait with you wanting you to get up. Baby steps, Jesus didn’t die to look down upon us and condemn us at every wrong move; not so, the love He has is not the same love we understand. Moreover, everybody grows at different levels and you mean so much to Him. Most importantly those with greater light are no different from those who first come to the Lord. This is why Jesus said, do not judge and you will not be judged. And the same measure you look at someone’s fault, or faith, and church, or looking down on someone boastfully, will your personal judgement be towards how God looks upon you. Love your enemy’s, live righteously, forgive those who did wrong to you, and never bring it up to them again. This is how Jesus forgives us. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. God is Love, John 3: 16. He cares for all of us; most importantly He is not a respecter of persons and is not willing that any should perish, but all come to repentance. We should show ourselves approved unto God by studying His word a little bit at a time. Strive to be the best you can without overworking yourself. Now when reading the Bible keep looking where you can improve your knowledge, relationships, faith, and if you have been blessed with much light and even teach His word, never ever think you know it all and have it figured out; when in fact you or I may be following compromised tradition unscriptural and unsound. Why this is important, well think about how many denominations there are in Christendom alone? So while researching when we read the Scriptures we should be looking for a closer relationship with Jesus; with a desire to appreciate and realize the entire Bible is truth from Genesis to Revelation. And this will also help you to choose a church denomination that Jesus leads you to by understanding truth in its proper interpretation.
       Some find for example the Old Testament is not relevant for them in the understanding of the New Testaments, putting aside books containing otherwise references that unlock the passage of truth pertaining to the subject in question at that time. Both Old and New Testaments work side by side. If you only had one leg it would be difficult to walk. So the Bible is likewise; assuming that the Old Testament was for the Israelite’s and the Jewish nation is a really unwise decision so many fall into; as there are more an excuse not to study reasoning away and withholding from themselves the ability in reaching the stars and Heavens store house of treasures pure truth in other words. God would love to have you receive more and more as you grow. But doubt, old habits, personal views, family, someone’s view or church folk and denominational doctrine, keep them back from growing in grace. These traits may stop you from increasing light the Holy Spirit wants to increase you with. So wherever you worship take time to decipher yourself the word of God, always confirming that what you heard in church is in fact Biblical. Again these and more may lead you to become a leader and less the follower you were in a church not knowing why you go to church in the first place; if that is the case, as for me that was. So why do you go to the church you follow? We all need to ask ourselves this including myself. Some would rather believe anything as long as there in church and they feel optimistic believing their pastor has it all down and understood as you perceive it, and that he would not lead you astray, however, he may be readily rejecting otherwise easy truth made complicated, nevertheless if your pastor or teacher gives you them joy joy feelings weekly all is good right? But is this ok in God’s view? Not so, as I said above, we should not take the stance that leaving it to our church to save us is good enough. No, we need to continually search the Scripture making sure what we here in fact are the oracles ‘of solid truth doctrinally only then can we be grounded and not moved from the storm that is coming and now is. Jesus said we need to build our houses on a foundation that involves structure with faith, strength and love. Our immediate attention depends on it. And in the inspired word of God as the Author of the most powerful book ever, is heard “It is written” in the volume of God’s omnipresents.
        You are a flower most fitted to show your true colors, not to conceal them in false doctrine where you never get the chance to love yourself as God made us to become even during the times of adversity. But if you withdraw from the Sun, you will always remain the same and never grow; insecure, scared, unsure, a follower. We all have true inner beauty that Jesus has given us we are all made with a beautiful mind let’s put it to work and the truth will set us free. This freedom will only truly be experienced when the real truth of God’s word becomes sound, stable, firm, unconditional strength with secure courage, in all faith, and agape, and a fulfilled life with zeal that promises new meaning. Be ye perfect building eternal Excellencies’ with your Heavenly Father who shines down upon you His majesty, and life with the absolute solidness His omniscient longs to give you the confidence you have always longed for. Knowing you really belong to something so much greater, bigger, wonderful spectacular, over and above anything this life can offer. Our Lord has said in His amazing manual, meant just for you, and is an invitation to eternal life yours free. Jesus paid your bill that you may have eternal life forever. Brothers and sisters don’t delay, while He may still be found reach for Him.
        Don’t indirectly or directly suppress your rose peddles, grow in all truth. Stand up to intimidation, brake through, study prayerfully, our ability to learn is as endless as the entire universe is, when learning is concerned; and Jesus will shine His light upon you as the sun is to a flower. Let your colors open also beloved, reach high to the warmth the sun gives. Be invigorated with true unmoved sound truth in its true light and purpose and meaning for us as our God intended it to be. And Jesus will help you shine your colors to others; reflecting radiant beauty, and all will see in you a new you.
        When Moses asked to see God face to face while receiving the 10 Commandments high in the mountains; the Lord said to Moses, I will walk by you, look at me after I walk past you. Moses only saw the back of God as His light would have rendered Moses perhaps unconscious even death. That’s why Moses was not permitted to behold God face to face; but how beautiful God was to Moses by allowing it to happen the way God permitted it to be so; by walking by him. I could imagine how excited Moses felt, however, not until Moses came down from the mountain did Joshua, who by the way, if you’re not familiar with was this next great prophet who took Moses place after God took Moses to Heaven. Now when Joshua waited patiently for Moses to return, that upon seeing Moses; Joshua said, Moses there is a great light that shines from your face. Moses replied, I have seen God, with a look of pure determination and strength, Joshua bowed to Moses, but quickly Moses rebuked this action, saying, do not bow to me Joshua, but only to your God and mine. As Moses and Joshua descended from God’s holy mountain; the children of Israel could not look upon Moses as his face was radiant with Devine light from God. This is typology and would be understood as to a type of light God wants to impart to us. As I mentioned above, though are faces don’t light up, our hearts do. And our lives reflect the indwelling Holy Spirit of truth, yes to all sound truth, and God lives with you and I in faith, and our hearts take on a new beat to the sound of Devine indwelling light our Lord imparts to all who ask as Moses asked. And be it according to our faith then you and I become are a tower of strength, unmoveable, walking in the faith and fear of the Lord as all God’s people from generation to the next have done before us. Some faithful most respectful person’s soldiers, men of stature, true warriors who would rather die than deny their God walking in the fear and strength of the Lord continually, declaring Lord Omnipotent, the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob; Even as the prophet Elijah had said out loud before God consumed his sacrifice by raining firer down from Heaven, in full site of king Ahab and his Baal false prophet worshippers.
        So today we need to ask our Lord to remove all the habits that long suppressed us by the little light we had even telling ourselves negative comments, bad traits all of us have in our life, we sometimes feed ourselves with negativity and subliminally our systems become immune to self destruction. Moreover our inner beauty never develops and our flower peddles never reach God’s throne, the Creator of lights. Yes everything created, made He you, reach for Him. He made you and all we see in the earth; the beautiful sunsets, the hills and valleys with water streams rushing over the rocks, also, the teaming amounts of living organisms both small and great, a reflection of how much God loves you and I. Stop once and a while take the time to look, at everything He made everything seen made He all for us. You are a remarkable created being and throughout the generations there is not one being that is anything close to your own genetic gens. You and I were made in the image of God we should never forget this we are special in God’s eyes. Furthermore, all around us, God speaks to us again through all nature not only around our earth and planet; but when we look up at the night sky science today is still baffled trying to understand the begging’s of life. Yes, be filled with adoration, be in love, and experience a joy no man can buy, nor take away from you.
       Now while Jesus was here 2000 years ago He preformed countless miracles and raising people from the dead, and feeding on two occasions 5000, and if I’m not mistaken another 4000. Whenever He healed someone, He would say “let it be according to your faith”, believe, and it will happen.
       Be humble, with all humility asking God to help you in all you do. Also, Jesus loves children, He instructed us to have characters as the little children as they are innocent, they love running to Him. On one occasion a child ran to Him, He picked the child up and hugged him, commenting, “suffer the little children to come on to me, and forbid them not; for their angels go before the face of God”  Myself, I see my hands around His waist as a child never letting go. It helps me to identify with the person Jesus wants me to be always. He longs for all of us to be this way; Jesus said, “unless we become as the little children, we cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven” Though I have been blessed with much light, I am no different from you; remaining teachable always listening more than speaking understanding this is wisdom. Try to slow down in life, perhaps to pet a dog, or to understand the amazing logistics a simple flower takes to grow and opening up when the sun shines upon it. God gave us, these beautiful little joys, and that we take time to appreciate Him; the longer you examine something most everybody takes for granted, upon doing this, stop, look around and try to see the craziness and busy pace people in this generation are actually doing, running after their dreams, it actually is sad the more you stay away from the world this becomes extremely evident that something is not right in this world. More beautiful is a little flower again His creation. Jesus worded to His disciples that a little Lilly is arrayed more wonderful then any King that has ruled on this world from all generations. Ask as King David asked, He asked God, I want to know the heart of My Lord. One only needs to read the book of Psalms; King David wrote, yes God did bless him with his wish. I am also asking the Lord as King David asked, Jesus, I want to know you more and more, but I’m not worthy to ask God as King David did. Nevertheless I will never give up on Jesus I love Him more beyond words can describe.
        So whatever level you are in your walk with Christ continue in faith building a relationship spending time with Him talk to Him like you’re talking to a good friend on a phone chat or so. Be yourself enjoy His comfort for He is with you, but He will not force you or your decision to accept Him. Nevertheless He longs for you I know this to be very true. I am living proof to all my words; I love you Jesus, Daddy. Yes the minute you invite Jesus into your heart the same minute His covering is upon you and in that moment. He promises that He will never leave you nor forsake you; begin to build a relationship the sooner the better, your life will change. Now remember, life is still life, some Christians early in their walk might experience hardship telling others that their life was not bad; but when they became Christian’s life became more difficult. Later becoming frustrated and throwing the towel in. So be easy on yourself allow for times to become unsettling. Read some of the Old Testament books written by God’s Holy prophets; yes their life was not joyful, in some cases; nevertheless, they remained faithful as they never gave up there calling from His love. These are true heroes, worriers; I call defenders of the faith, one generation to the next. And God called ordinary men just like you and I, you never know, He may have His eye on you. If you have not invited Jesus to live with you or want to rededicate your Love for what He has done in your life this far; this is a suggested prayer for you to read and receive with your heart and invite the King of King’s and Lord of Lord’s to be with you right now. Say,
        Lord my God, thank you for saving me and forgiving me of my sins, help me to be the person you want me to be that I may serve you all the days of my life and honor you always, increase my faith that I may build my dreams, hopes and future with you. Help me to repent of my sins, and walk in the righteousness of your great love. I love you so much Jesus, thank you for dying that I might have life. All this I ask in the beautiful name of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I pray this now and forever Amen, and Amen. God be with all you. AmenI want dispel a widely pervalent myth – namely that somewhere before the middle of Daniels 70th week there has to be a great war that ushers in the reign of the beast. 3 things are often cited:-1) The seal 2 ‘large sword’ which supposedly doesn’t start until the first half of the Daniels 70th week
2) The war of Ezekiel 38 / 39 which mystically some have placed this side of the millenium !!
3) The sixth trumpet war where 1/3 of mankind is killed said to be ‘any time soon’I will address each of these separately:-
1) The seal 2 ‘large sword’ (peace taken from the earth) was in fact released millenia ago (in fact Zech 6 speaks forth their release) – in fact can anyone recount a time in recent history where peace was over the earth – instead there have been two world wars and no signs of immediate abating – in other words seal 2 is not confined to the 1st half of Daniels week and so there is no reason, on that basis, to think that a special war will take place in that time period
2) The Gog/Magog war – there are only 2 mentions of this in the entirety of scripture (1 in the OT and 1 in the NT) – and note that the Revelations of John invariably carry an OT reference. In fact Ezekiel 38/39 maps perfectly onto Rev 20 Gog/Magog war which occurs AFTER the millenium. Ezek 38 /39 says that Gog is BURIED at this time (there is a FINALITY about the description) therefore for this reason also it must be referring to the event which occurs AFTER the millenium.
3) The sixth trumpet war is something you are likely to be open to if you hold to a ‘recapitulation’ view of the seals, trumpets and bowls as opposed to a ‘progressive’ view.
It is self evident by close inspection that the seals , trumpets and bowls are NOT different views of each other but rather its SEALS then TRUMPETS then BOWLS which progressively intensify – the structure of Revelation presents this clear chronology (I’ve shown the chronology of the book in a recent post). Elsewhere in another recent post I compiled 3 scriptures which put together show BEYOND DOUBT that the 6th seal cannot occur before the midpoint of the ‘7’. On top of this the trumpets MUST follow the seals and therefore the 6th trumpet ‘war’ MUST follow (sometime after) the 6th seal which in turn occurs during the final half of Daniels week.I know it is far more sensational to ‘prophesy’ of an upcoming imminent Great War but it’s just plain misleading.  It pays to really study your Bible rather than simply to latch onto the latest sensationalists.In addition the 1/3 of mankind killed in the ‘sixth trumpet war’ cannot as I see it include faithful believers as Rev 7 clearly shows that those having the seal of God cannot be touched by the trumpet judgments (the trumpets are CLEARLY part of God’s wrath -I can show this again if I really have to ). Faithful believers already have their seal (Eph 1:13,14) unto the day of redemption.In addition in Rev 9 (at the end of the sixth trumpet events) we see….
20 The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk. 21 Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.….clearly indicating that the target of the trumpet judgment was the unrepentant (not faithful believers)dear Irvin
I was wandering is it a good possibility that Jesus Christ could come
this year I would like to know likelihood of his return in 2017 please
email me back and answer what you know because I herd the
revelation 12 prophecy is going to be fulfilled on September 23rd
2017 I hope to hear back because I would like to know if this is true thanks LaDawnLaDawn…try studying your bible instead of hanging off sensationalists. Irvin will only tell you that He can’t return until AT LEAST 2024….(please read his article above)I’ve heard a sep 23rd prophecy before namely in 2015 and that didn’t work out !!LaDawn,Scripture clearly states that we are not to know the dates of these matters , just to be able to know the ‘seasons’ .  We can look back in time and with scripture see that various prophecies have come true and such as the rebirth of Israel . We are close to Jesus return but – no one can tell us the exact day any prophecy will happen. Jesus will come to earth after the “abomination that makes desolate” of Daniel 9 occurs and the temple for that to happen in is not yet built .
The rapture may occur this year , then again we cannot know that with any certainity as it may not happen this year , just be ready so when it does you can be part of it , in the mean time serve Christ Jesus as best you canPlease allow people to express their view without bashing them .
Some of the things I see stated as fact when it is not fact is stating the rapture is the same
as the return /2nd coming of Christ , if you wish to believe that , fine but it is not possible to prove it ,  there are many scriptures that indicate that these are 2 different events that happen at 2 different time periods.
If you choose to believe otherwise at least please show
yourself to be a Godly brother or sister in Christ and love and not be a basher.
Of various things that are not of accuracy is trying to say that Michael or any other Angel is the Restrainer as an angel simply cannot perform the function of the Restrainer
Consider the fact that the Restrainer is holding back ( if you will ) a tidal wave of sin , when the Restrainer is taken out of the way an overwhelming rampaging avalanche of sins of types of measures of sinful conduct will come pouring out like a tsunami . While it is not clear if it is a
combination of demonic and human sin , the massive flood of it has never been seen on earth before like it will during the time the Restrainer is taken out of the way.
It seems far more probable that the Only person who is capable and able to hold this back in restraining is God Almighty Himself.
In this case it be the person of the Holy Spirit . For Him to be taken out of the way does not mean He has to be removed from earth , it only means He is stops restraining and allows the fullness of Gods plan to be ushered in
We have been living in a time Christ refers to an Age ,the Church Age and Christ spoke that at the end of The Age He will return to earth to be King on earth.
While it can be fun discussing this topic it should be tempered with the facts of what is and has been happening on our world that relates to to this evidence of prophecies and not just merely some theological interpretations of what some think is true . There are so many things and facts that are interesting that couples with this such as – Most people are not aware of the fact that there are hundreds of human skeletons that are average of 15 feet tall up to about twice that tall and have been found all over the earth.
In the past as in the 1800’s these findings were commonly in the newspapers , but no more. These skeletons along with many many other unusual things are locked away in the vaults of the Vatican where they are kept hidden. Learn about an agency from the Vatican that has been around a very long time called The Entity – you will be astonished about what they have acquired , the Vatican has been trying to create a one world religion trying to get all religions to join them , they even endorse a religion called Chrislam. Study the pale horse in Rev 6:8 is pale green refers to islam , The Vatican is preparing to tell the world that aliens from another world has taken away people from earth . Lots of things to look into , have fun 🙂the “secret of lawlessness” is simply that sin or lawlessness has the potential to cause angelic protection to lift from attack by fallen angels. There is a precedent for Gods angels restraining fallen angels:-Daniel 1013 But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.
…..
The “king of Persia” referred to here is a territorial spirit (demon) not a human kingHi Kev,
The scriptures tell us that satan/lucifer is a higher ranking more powerful angelic being than Michael the archangel and therefore Michael does not have the power or authority to hold back the Man of sin/son of Perdition from being revealed , which is who the Restrainer is restraining or holding back from being revealed .
Only God Almighty has the authority and power over satan/Man of sin. While he evil antichrist spirit of the evil satan is at work in the world now , the human man the Man of Sin/ Son of Perdition who will be thee Antichrist satan incarnate in a human body who will become the ruler in the world government is not yet revealed and will only be revealed when God allows it , hence it will be the Holy Spirit who is the Restrainer and will at the appointed time step aside and allow this Man of Sin /Son of Perdition to have his reign on earth.
In Jude 1:9 shows that even Michael concedes not to confront the devil/satan as he defers to the authority of God AlmightyYou say Michael isn’t strong enough but what about
Rev 12
7 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8 But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 9 The great dragon was hurled down – that ancient snake called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.Note also that this precedes the rise of the beast in
Rev 13
13 The DRAGON STOOD ON THE SHORE OF THE SEA. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.
and both are midpoint / abomination of desolation events (note the dragon stood on the shore of the sea AFTER BEING HURLED DOWN TO EARTH FROM HEAVEN not to mention that Rev 12 precedes Rev 13 !)Here’s an OT example of how the “secret” of lawlessness works:-6 The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites. 2 Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. 3 Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. 4 They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. 5 They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. 6 Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the Lord for help.7 When the Israelites cried out to the Lord because of Midian, 8 he sent them a prophet, who said, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 9 I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land. 10 I said to you, “I am the Lord your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.” But you have not listened to me.’sorry that’s from the book of Judges….Hello
Reading through the thread here I see thoughts expressed that really need some clarification and scripture references to clear up some things. First I would like to say that it would be great to see brothers and sisters express their views without blasting & bashing  views , engage in dialog with love and support for one another. I hear those in the pre-trip camp say things like “I’m outa here see ya” referring to the rapture in a sorta glib and cavalier manner.
Not exactly a good manner as it kinda makes others think all pre-trip folks think the same way , well they do not all say things like that and it does not mean pre-trib is wrong.
I have studied this for more than 30 years and often hear views that overlook scriptures that should be acknowledged and others that need to be looked at more closely.  I see some believers practice what I call a Darwinistic approach where they start with their chosen perceived endpoint and work back to the beginning to try to show their view is accurate but it typically ends in error and flawed with overlooking things and a misunderstanding of other things.
Lets start with that some folks see that there is the 144000 that have a special God given seal placed on them for protection from harm and then assume that because Paul tells us that when we accept Christ as savoir and become a believer God puts a seal on us at that time , that this is to support that Christians will go through the great trib but these 2 seals are entirely separate and different from each other and not related at all. Lets examine the scripture and compare. Paul says in Eph 1:13,14
13 In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.
Everyone knows that when we accept Christ as savoir and become born-again that our bodies become the temple of the Holy Spirit who lives within us and Paul makes it clear that the seal we get when we accept Jesus as savoir is the Holy Spirit that we are “sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise” . Of all the many millions of born again Christians throughout the ages none has a seal on their forehead
Rev 7:3  3 saying, “Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.”
These 144000 Jews from the named tribes are a very special group of men who have lived exemplary lives and are chosen by God specifically for a specific purpose. The very next verse after the 144000 are identified we are told about the great multitude that accepted Jesus during the great trib. Rev 14 tells us:
3 They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men, being firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
Our Great God our Father is not a trickster to give us His word to trip us up in following His word. These very special 144000 Jews are specifically named and lifted up on High with Lord God for what they did during the great trib. With the way this scripture is laid out for us the only plausible explanation of what the purpose of the 144000 is to evangelize -spread the gospel!
This great multitude are born again Christians accepting Jesus as savoir during the great trib!.
A scenario for you to consider– Imagine that you and another person are sitting in your house that is locked up tight and no pets or animals and your wallet & car keys are on the coffee table in front of this other person and you go into another room for a moment to change your shirt and you come back out and find that your wallet keys and car are gone. Would you not reason that the most plausible explanation is that the other person has taken your wallet keys and car with the greatest probability ? Would you really need to hear someone say it verbally before giving it a significant plausibility ?
Also consider that if there were still the current billions of Christians on earth during the great trib who were continuing to evangelize as they do now and then only 144000 get a seal of protection from harm and others fellow Christians who are believers before the 144000 appear on the scene are allowed to die it would be a contradiction to Gods Word and promise to keep us out of that specific time period known as the great trib that tests the inhabitants of earth.
Add to that just for the sake of my point , say we are in the great trib now and only the 144000 were permitted to stand with Jesus and sing the new song that only they can know that God gave them that would be seen as bias or favoritism by many if they were here evangelizing alongside those 144000 doing the same thing Our God would not do that to His beloved children. Additionally Gods Word tells us plainly that we the Church will come to earth WITH Jesus when he returns
Colossians 3:4King James Version (KJV)
4 When Christ, who is our life, Shall Appear, then Shall YOU ALSO Appear WITH HIM in Glory
This reasonably explains how it can be that no Christians on earth prior to the great trib and the Christians that exist during the great trib were those who living through hell on earth chose to accept Jesus as savoir during the great trib. Now consider that from Rev 5 through the time Jesus retuns to earth which is about 15 chapters of this book of Rev with no mention of Christians on earth as Israel being unrepentant is being punished along with the enemies of God for their rejection of Messiah Yeshua.
 Consider that in Rev 3:10 Jesus stated ” 10 Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth”
The English word ‘from’ is in the Greek the word “ek” and is defined as “out from”
Jesus in this verse is telling us that if we remain steady in our faith and do not fall away and turn to the worlds ways but remain in Him that he will keep us Out From /Out Of that time period a specifically noted “hour of trial to test those who dwell on earth”  The there are many other scriptures that reiterate that same premise.
I make my living as a troubleshooter , cars , computers etc. and it is important to diagnose and determine if things are in correct alignment , In this case in alignment with the total gospel truth of Gods Word so I need to verify all I learn to be accurate and hopefully everyone else truly desires to be accurate rather than just follow a teaching that someone tells them and does not know how to confirm what they hear to be true . If there is something I have not heard before I ask for scripture that supports it so I can study it . I can change my views if there is accurate evidence that shows that it needs adjustment and hopefully others who do not study can benefit from what I share.I will add that in Rev 7:3 it does not outright state that the 144000 will be protected from harm , it is implied that they are as the command from God is given to not hurt the earth , nor the sea , nor the trees until the 144000 get their seal, Since God does things with design and purpose there is some real purpose for Lord God to give this command. It seems to coincide with the idea that these Jews do not follow the teaching of the false one world religion that is represented by the false prophet the Man of Sin partner in crime and Believe only in Messiah Jesus and through these 144000 Jews a multitude of people get to hear the true Gospel of Jesus and obtain salvation. This also coincides with the teaching that the Christian Bride of Christ is not on earth evangelizingIt can however  be reasonably surmised that the fleeing Jewish remnant in Rev 12 who flee to a PLACE OF SAFETY from satans wrath are in fact the 144,000 (not definite but I consider likely). That being the case they would be quite restricted in terms of evangelising the world. Regardless of that remnants protection from antichrist (are they possibly located in Daniel’s stated antichrist immune region of Edom, Moab and Ammon – ie current day Jordan ?) they would still need to be additionally protected from the subsequent judgments (ie sealed for protection from them). If they dared venture outside the protected region (Jordan ?) – Daniel 11:41 He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand. – in order to evangelise they would leave themselves exposed to antichrist ! Also as stated elsewhere there simply wouldn’t be time in the window between the 6th seal and 7th seal to evangelise a great multitude AND for them to be martyred by antichrist for not accepting the mark – ie unable to eat, drink or have shelter (as per Rev 7).The far more plausible scenario given the limited window of time between the 6th (end of Rev 6) and 7th seal (start of Rev 8) is:-The 144,000 (taking these to be the fleeing remnant of Rev 12) are sealed so as to protect from the judgments (already having been protected from the dragon / antichrist at or around the midpoint by virtue of their physical location).The martyred believers (great multitide) are those that have always been around (ie no pre trib rapture) and remained faithful to death (didn’t take the mark) and are deprived of food, water and shelter from the midpoint up to the 6th seal – ie the great tribulation (see Rev 7) – but suddenly appear altogether at once. This group of martyrs will be the ‘final quota’ of martyrs alluded to at the 5th seal (Rev 6: 9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 10 They called out in a loud voice, ‘How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?’ 11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the FULL NUMBER of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters,[c] were killed just as they had been.)
– before Gods wrath can be poured out.We know that the great trib (persecution by antichrist) began at the midpoint.All in all a far more plausible explanation given time constraints.Sam…as you probably guessed I have a lot to say in response to this post.First off brutal honesty can be an expression of love even more so than ‘soft soaping’ comfort. You find that with the way Jesus often spoke to the Pharisees who were hardened in their erroneous mindset. I’m not making a direct comparison with them just showing you how love (agape) can be expressed in different ways. Also emotion is notoriously difficult to convey via written text.The reason pre-trib people often come out with insubstantial things is simply that it has NO exegetical support in scripture. I have historically laid out a few challenges to pre-tribbers and NO ONE to date has been adequately able to provide me with concrete scriptural backing for their view.
You talk about “start with their chosen perceived endpoint and work back to the beginning to try to show their view is accurate” however that’s what pre-tribbers do when they try to explain how the great multitude of martyred believers exist when believers have apparently bee swiped away beforehand. The reasoning goes that the 144,000 must have evangelised them however it says NO WHERE in Rev that they do this (and in fact they would have almost no time to achieve this (Rev 7) as the sealing of the 144,000 and the great multitude appearing occur in the same small window of time between the 6th seal – warning of imminent judgment -(end of Rev 6) and the start of the 7th seal – the judgments themselves – (start of Rev 8)) – in fact Santa Claus would arguably have more chance of delivering presents to everyone on Christmas Eve 🙂Regarding the ‘seal’ (given in Rev 7 to the 144,000)….both in Rev 9 and Ezekiel 9 you’ll see that those who are seeing this seal IN THE FOREHEAD are in fact ANGELS:-
Rev 9
1 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the ABYSS. 2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 3 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of SCORPIONS OF THE EARTH. 4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.(NB Jesus Himself decoded SCORPIONS as referring to DEMONS = Luke 10:17 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, ‘Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.’18 He replied, ‘I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.)Clearly in Rev 9 FALLEN angels are in view.Let’s now look at its parallel OT passage (note this is what Rev 9 trumpet 5 judgment maps to most directly):Ezek 9
1 Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, ‘Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.’ 2 And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.3 Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the Lord called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side 4 and said to him, ‘Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a MARK ON THE FOREHEADS of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.’5 As I listened, he said to the others, ‘Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. 6 Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.’ So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple.It is clear from both of these passages that this MARK is only visible in the SPIRITUAL realm NOT the NATURAL realm (ie not visible to natural men) so why is it so difficult to suppose that when an angel comes across someone having seal of the Holy Spirit it is visible to them in the SPIRITUAL realm as a mark upon their forehead ?Regarding the 144,000 I have responded to an earlier post of yours saying that these will be a remnant preserved simply “on account of the patriarchs” – they don’t need a special function. ALL Israel will be saved. You say…. You say you are eager for accuracy but as I see it I’m invariably the only one who seems to provide SOLID scriptural backing for my views…Apologies…I made a comment “It is clear from both of these passages that this MARK is ONLY visible in the SPIRITUAL realm”. I have to retract this and say that it is not explicitly stated that the mark is invisible in the natural realm – it’s just that it’s reasonable to surmise that it is perhaps so because only angels (fallen or otherwise) are shown as needing to see it.…and if it is a purely ‘spiritual’ mark then what ramifications might that have with regard to the counterfeiters mark ??Whilst on this topic I have been asked “how do you get victory over the mark” ?My answer was:-Victory over the mark simply means NEVER TAKING IT even if it means our physical death (martyrdom). I know physical death doesn’t sound like much of a victory but if you stay faithful to the end and refuse the mark to the end the eternal consequences are for more preferable – to me that’s victory !Rev 20:4 demonstrates what ‘victory over the mark’ translates to:-
4 I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They[a] had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands.I think there’s a bit of a misunderstanding as many do about the distinction between the tribulation (wrath of satan) and the wrath of God.The tribulation is specifically persecution of God’s people (midpoint to 6th seal). The wrath of God is Gods judgments on the world in response to its treatment of His people (seal 7 onwards, trumpets + bowls – see seal the 5 prayers of the martyrs). All God’s people are potentially open to the wrath of satan but not the wrath of God. My understanding are that the 144,000 are the same remnant of Jews mentioned in Rev 12 who flee to a place of safety from the serpent and are protected from him for 3.5 years.
Believers who die will die because of the wrath of satan NOT the wrath of God (gentile believers don’t appear to have such a place of safety). Jesus promised that  the Jews would not be extinguished before “ALL these things have happened”…..Matt 24:34 Truly I tell you, THIS GENERATION will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.He physically protects the 144,000, as I understand it, on “account of the patriarchs”.Hey Kev
Glad you’re back !  . While I do agree with various points you make and scriptures you offer  you seem to not understand the points I bring to your attention . I will restate my points and hopefully you will see what I am driving at.
Matthew 4 :4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on EVERY WORD that comes from the mouth of God.”
Focusing on the part of on every word that comes from the word of God. There will be a lot of really good people who are very caring and generous that would give the shirt of their back to help people that will not make it into the Kingdom simply cause they will not accept Christ as their lord and savoir , they simply do not believe.  I bring some facts supported by scripture and you simply will not accept them as they do not support your views. Some people may not hang in there with you as you bring out your whip 🙂
. A point I was bringing out is that the book of Rev is a 1 on 1 meeting between Jesus and John and Jesus told him at the start to
Write down what you see and send it to the Churches – it be rightly important when the CREATOR says to take note and pass it on to the people. I have made note that  Jesus has reason and purpose and design for whatever he says even if people do not understand it.
Jesus made it a point to tell John about 144000 Jews and the tribes they come from and that they will get a seal on their forehead so Yes it IS important . It is God Almighty speaking about the events that reveal HIS COMING to earth to setup HIS Kingdom. Jesus speaks directly that the 144000 have to have this seal put on their foreheads before the demons are permitted to carry on with their wreaking havoc on earth.
Consider what God told Daniel when Daniel said he did not understand ,  God said seal up the book and go thy way , basically saying it is not meant for him to understand as only those who are living in the ‘time of the end’ when those things written about are happening will understand . But yet it is important for the people living during the time of the end to know about it.
It be the same way with the 144000 , people of today don’t really understand who they are and what their purpose will be , but yet the CREATOR says it is important for John to take note and write it down and pass this on to the people and all future generations. They do have a purpose in this time of the end . In your view they don’t have a purpose. There are reasons why God does not give every detail , and as such since you do not know what role or purpose the 144000 is, there is no way you can be accurate that they will not be spreading the gospel of Jesus . Also scripture never provides a number count of how many would be the remant as there are now approx 14 miilion blood line Jews and others that have a mix and there is no known number of how many of them have not accepted Christ as messiah so I don’t know what you mean about the patriarchs in this context as they are not even mentioned in the context of these scriptures.
.  Considering the fact that Jesus himself declared that those who stay with him he will keep us out from the great trib -post tribbers simply disregard any scriptures like that because they cannot  fit it into their view.
Another point is consider that if  God said people are not appointed unto cancer ,  people will say great  we wont get cancer ,, now it be different if it was said you wont get lung cancer but you will suffer skin cancer . When Gods word says we are not appointed unto wrath , it means what it says , it does not say we are not appointed unto wrath of God but we will suffer the wrath  of satan in the great trib – No it does not say anything like that.
Jesus was making reference of how some Jews will suffer at the hands of the Antichrist rule if they are in the area of Judea and surrounding areas. Also need to consider that it is God Almighty who appoints kings and presidents into power and when the Antichrist/satan has his reign of terror it is appointed by God that it happens and when it happens . God himself declares he will put the hook in the jaw of the enemy of Israel and pull then down to wage war on the unrepentant Jews and to show the whole world that it is God Almighty in control of everything according to His Authority
 If we play by your rule as adamant that since the scriptures does not point blank say the 144000 will spread the gospel of Jesus , find me a scripture that clearly point blank says that born again Christians who have obtained salvation will go through the great trib, you won’t find it as it does not exist as that is completely opposite of what Jesus tells us outright.
Reading at the 6th seal it clearly says that it is the wrath of the Lamb and the wrath of God all this hapening before the wrath of satan , alas people want to say that the book is not laid out in a chronilogical manner, I see how that can be thought but makes it too easy to manipulate to accomidate preference . it is what it is , laid out Seals then Vials , then Trumpets . . Then it gets where it is supposed that all streamlined into another contradiction that chronological order satans wrath starts on sunday monday and tuesday and ends then Gods wrath starts and finishes out the rest of the week 🙂  When truly both the wrath of God and wrath of satan are happening at the same time. There is so much focus on trying to fiqure out exactly when it the rapture people trying to say that it is before this vial and after this seal or after this trumpet and before this trumpet etc. -it  gets real crazy.
. I often hear ppl say that the 7th angel blowing trumpet is the same as Paul speaking of the Last trumpet  blast and try to say that is the rapture  , well no they are definately not the same but I’ll get to that later. Truly though when all these things ramp up in happening it will be hell on earth and ppl will not be trying to say when the vials will end and the trumpet plagues begin as it will be like when earthquakes or tsunami happen everyone will be focused on how to stay alive .I do see that the seals co-relate to bowl and trumpet judgments as in to say when seal x is opened it shows y results , sort of  like a series of plagues as in the days of Moses , but the people who are in this time of terror are those who would not accept salvation before the Son of Perdition reign begins and their are those who seem to forget that the entirety of scripture teaches that God is long suffering and gives people chance after chance after chance(Moses and the plagues) after chance , after chance to come to him and calls these chances things like last chance saloon 🙂oops my typo in the order seals, trumpets and bowls.
I do see that the seals co-relate to bowl and trumpet judgments as in to say when seal x is opened it shows y results , sort of  like a series of plagues as in the days of Moses , but the people who are in this time of terror are those who would not accept salvation before the Son of Perdition reign begins and their are those who seem to forget that the entirety of scripture teaches that God is long suffering and gives people chance after chance after chance(Moses and the plagues) after chance , after chance to come to him and calls these chances things like last chance saloon 🙂Regarding the exact timing of the rapture it is important to know that it is right at the very end otherwise we might end up thinking …”oh no ..I’ve missed the boat …might as well give in now”.
All we then need to know is just to keep hanging on ‘til the very end………….!I’m going to give you a series of scriptural proofs for the post trib. rapture but one thing you’re going to have to do is take your tinted spectacles off and open yourself fully to what they are saying. If I highlight a word in capitals it will usually be because either (a) its a word indicating chronology or (b) its a word you might have mistaken ideas about or preconceptions about and you need to earnestly research (I have no time or inclination to do that for you). Also you need to understand that the word rapture doesn’t exist in the bible – it is variously referred to as “being caught up “, “harvest”, “being gathered” – if you can’t see that then there’s no point reading any further.
Anyway here goes:-PROOF TEXTS #1
===============
The only one you should really need is in Matt 24 the words of Jesus himself (I have retained only the salient parts):-15 ‘So when you see standing in the holy place “the ABOMINATION THAT CAUSES DESOLATION,”[a] spoken of through the prophet Daniel – let the reader understand – 21 For THEN there will be great DISTRESS, unequalled from the beginning of the world until now – and never to be equalled again.29 ‘Immediately AFTER the distress OF THOSE DAYS
……
‘“the sun will be darkened,
    and the moon will not give its light;
the stars will fall from the sky,
    and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.”[b]
………..
31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will GATHER his ELECT from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
The order is clear
1)	ABOM OF DESOL
2)	TRIBULATION/PERSECUTION OF GOD’S PEOPLE
3)	6th SEAL SIGNS
4)	RESURRECTION/RAPTURE (SOME TIME AFTER)PROOF TEXTS #2
===============Rev 20
And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They[a] HAD NOT WORSHIPPED THE BEAST or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. 5 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the FIRST resurrection. 1 Thess 4
15 According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that WE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will CERTAINLY NOT PRECEDE those who have FALLEN ASLEEP. 16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the TRUMPET CALL of God, and the DEAD in Christ will rise FIRST. 17 AFTER THAT, we who are STILL ALIVE and are left will be CAUGHT UP together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.These two scriptures put together give a clear order:-
1) Mark and beast
2) FIRST resurrection (of the dead in Christ)
3) Rapture (of the living in Christ)PROOF TEXTS #3
===============2 Thess 2
2 Concerning the COMING of our Lord Jesus Christ AND our being GATHERED to him,…..
3 DON’T LET ANYONE DECEIVE YOU IN ANY WAY, for THAT day will not come UNTIL the rebellion occurs AND THE MAN OF LAWLESSNESS ID REVEALED.Notice in particular that the  TWO events (the COMING of our Lord AND or being GATHERED to Him) are referenced with THAT day (SINGULAR)…there is absolutely NO hint of these being TWO different days.
Note also the MAN OF SIN has to be HERE FIRSTPROOF TEXTS #4
=============For this next one there is no way around you simply accepting that the 7th trumpet is the Last Trumpet of 1 Corinthians…John and Paul didn’t need to discuss this with each other..the same Holy Spirit inspired boths writings (2 Tim 16 ALL Scripture is God-breathed ).Now lets take it we all know that the last trumpet mentioned in Revelation is the 7th so lets go on to… 1 Cor 15
at the LAST trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the DEAD WILL BE RAISED imperishable, and we will be changed.Also recalling…1 Thess 4
15 According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that WE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will CERTAINLY NOT PRECEDE those who have FALLEN ASLEEP. 16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the TRUMPET CALL of God, and the DEAD in Christ will rise FIRST. 17 AFTER THAT, we who are STILL ALIVE and are left will be CAUGHT UP together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.Tells us the order:-
1) LAST (7th Trumpet)
2) FIRST resurrection (of the dead in Christ)
3) Rapture (of the living in Christ)
PROOF TEXTS #5
===============
Matt 24
36 ‘But about THAT DAY or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,[f] but only the Father. 37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the FLOOD came and TOOK THEM ALL AWAY. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
……….
43 But understand this: if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the THIEF was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into
Matt 25
25 ‘At THAT TIME the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 6 ‘At midnight the cry rang out: “Here’s the BRIDEGROOM! Come out to meet him!”Notice how the above section knows NO concept of 2 or more distinct days of His coming …its all THAT day and THAT time …and we see judgment and rapture at the same time.Finally look at
Rev 16
12 The SIXTH angel poured out his BOWL on the great river Euphrates,  ……………..15 ‘Look, I come like a THIEF! Blessed is the one who STAYS AWAKE and REMAINS CLOTHED, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.’16 Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.17 The SEVENTH angel poured out his BOWL into the air, Notice when Rev places Jesus coming AS A THIEF (refer to the SINGULAR day mentioned immediately above in Matt 24/25)…between bowl 6 and 7 !!!!!The final thing I will add about this proof text is that Rev 10 tells us that the 7th trumpet will sound for a NUMBER OF DAYS (I believe this will be sounding while the 7 bowls are being delivered). That way the rapture occurs at BOTH the 7th TRUMPET and the 7th BOWL !!!Apologies…one last thing I need to add about the 7th trumpet on the timeline…….Rev 11
15 The SEVENTH angel sounded his TRUMPET, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said:‘The kingdom of the world HAS BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS MESSIAH,because you have taken your great power
    and HAVE BEGUN TO REIGNThis clearly places the 7th trumpet  at the end of the 7 years when Jesus takes up his millenial reign on earth.Anyway who cannot see the plain fact of the post trib rapture after all these, sad to say, is wilfully blind.I wish to include Colin C’s historic post here (in particular notice the ‘meeting the bridegroom’ bit…)This earlier post by Colin C encapsulates perfectly what actually transpires:

We are caught up “to meet” the Lord in the air at His 2nd Coming and conduct Him back to earth. The Greek word translated “to meet” is ‘Apantesin’. It is used in 3 places in the New testament. In Matt 25.6 it is used when the wise virgins go out “to meet” the bridegroom and conduct him back to the marriage.
Acts 28.15 The believers in Rome went out to Appii forum “to meet” (apantesin) Paul and conduct him back into Rome.
In 1 Thess 4:17 believers are “caught up together with them in the clouds ‘to meet’ (apantesin) the Lord in the air…”
The IVF Commentary says here Quote:
“So the Lord is pictured as ecsorted to the earth by his people – those newly raised from the dead and those who have remained alive.”
So we do go up to meet the Lord and come down again as His escorts!
The process of the leading citizens in ancient Helenistic Greek times in going out of a city for about a mile and conducting a visting dignatory back into the city was called the “Apantesis”. The Holy Spirit chose this word here in 1 Thess 4:17 to prevent the idea that the believers would be caught up to meet the Lord and then go to heaven! We are caught up to meet the Lord and we must conduct Him back to earth!
Colin CAnd here is what Strongs says about the word (G529):-
ἀπάντησις
the act of meeting, to meet
the act of meeting, to meet (a phrase …seemingly almost technical….. for the RECEPTION OF A NEWLY ARRIVED OFFICIAL).I have already anticipated what some might be thinking…
Aah but he’s coming as a thief and we don’t know the day or hour so how can it be post trib ?Ans:
Remember that Jesus spoke PRESENT tense when he said “Of that day or hour no one knows…not the Son nor the angels but only the Father’…..the thing that will start the clock running will be the signing of the firm covenant. Once that is known then everyone with insight will know the day of the rapture – it will be 7 prophetic years later !
Regarding the THIEF:-1 Thess
 Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, 2 for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 3 While people are saying, ‘Peace and safety’, destruction will come on them suddenly, as labour pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.4 But YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, are NOT in darkness that this day should surprise you like a thief !
So only to the ungodly will it be a surprise !Just made a mind blowing discovery about Matt 24:36 which is translated in the NIV as 36 ‘But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,[f] but only the Father.
Not only is ‘KNOWS’ in the present tense (of when Jesus was speaking) there are some key Greek words which have been lost from the translation OUDE and OUDEIS (meaning NOT YET !!!)
If you look at the interlinear translation in scripture4all.org it reads:-About YET the day that and the hour NOT YET ONE has perceived NOT YET the messengers of the heavensDo you see what has been lost in translation ? Critical information !
This means that at some point in the future that day CAN BE KNOWN !!!Further to this…believers protection from the wrath of God doesn’t mean they will be whisked out of the way before it is poured out (leastwise except perhaps the 7th bowl cataclysm) – I believe that believers will be protected from GODS wrath by our seal (the Holy Spirit (Eph 1:13,14) – NB my belief only not explicitly stated so in Rev but inferrable from other scriptures).Wasn’t God well able to make a distinction at the passover ? He saw the (mark of the) blood of the Lamb over the doorframes and His wrath passed over His people and was instead confined to their enemies. He is the same , yesterday , today and forever….Hey Kev ,
Hang in there after the mods update the page I will provide more detail that should help you understand , For this post (I will have to double check) but I recall the teaching on the Passover was that the blood was applied on the doorpost of the house and anyone who was inside of the house that had the blood applied to the door post was passed over sparing the lives of anyone inside of that house even if they did not belive in YHWH although it not likely that anyone who did not believe in YHWH would be that closey tied to ppl who did believe in YHWH.
During that time period the Holy Spirit was not available to people , the Holy Spirit came after Jesus went back to Heaven after His rise from the grave to life again. Passover was not a seal on the heart of people to identify individual ppl , but the seal Holy Spirit does identify individual ppl. God declares that the 144000 must have the seal on their forehead before the demons are to be released to wreak havoc where this must be a protection from the torment that the demons will inflict upon those who do not have the seal of God place on their forehead. That seal is placed on them for a specific reason before the demons are allowed to be released . During that very same timerame there will be the mark 666 that is placed on the forehead or right hand of ppll who accept the mark so that they may continue to buy and sell and as such they will acknowledge that they are partakers of the Antchrist system. Right now there are afew technologies that are totally able to fullfill the scripture of the mark 666 , only time will tell which one will be used . We are on the edge the cusp of our world economy for everyone to use a form of digital money . Everything bought or sold will be done in a digital manner eliminatig all cash and paper money all paper checks etc 100% digital. There are billions of ppl who do not believe in a god so they will not resist as they won’t care , they just want to carry on as usual
At this same time frame there is the False Church lead by the False Prophet , there will be a religious church that does not believe or follow the Messiah as the one true God . The limited number of 144000 Jews marked with a seal is a very significant matter to that time frame.
They could well be evangelizing the ppl of the world to help bring those who follow the False prophet to “come out of her” the false churchIs it true that the Lord won’t come all the way to earth at the raptureYes that is true But as you can see there are those who refuse to acknowledge it because they do not believe it.  When other believers chose not to accept scripture that goes against what they believe it can confuse others who have not studied the matter , which is why many churches will avoid speaking on the topic because some people get angry at other peoples view when it differsAt the rapture the Saints go Up into the clouds to meet Jesus in the clouds — At the 2nd coming of Jesus to earth  when “every eye shall see ” Jesus coming on clouds to earth the born again saints are With Jesus as he comes to earth at the end of the great tribThis earlier post by Colin C encapsulates perfectly what actually transpires:Colin Clifford says:

the act of meeting, to meet (a phrase seemingly almost technical for the reception of a newly arrived official).Jesus told me world ends in 2020 God showed me that Jesus is coming in 2028 I believe the rapture will be in fall of 2020 just google Before Its News 2020 Rapture u should find it also YouTube Russia War 2020 first video watch 5mins of itHello Kev
It is good to see that you say that God is the same yesterday, today and forever and I see you often choose a phrase of foreshadowing. I am about to show you evidence that not only is supported with scripture but also the laws and culture that were in place during the thousands of years the books of the bible were written. Like many in America and western world you do not understand nor seek to understand the Israeli/Jewish laws and culture of biblical times and only focus on an westen American view which results in your failure to properly understand .You make assumptions that mislead you to make more false assumptions, like assuming the rapture happens at the end.
It has been shown to you that the ONLY person who has the Authority and power to be the Restrainer is the Holy Spirit simply because the one who is being restrained is the Son of Perdition/Antichrist Man of Sin satan incarnate in a human man and satan cannot be restrained by an angel of lower ranking in authority and power than satan , which Michael the archangel is a lower authority than satan , plus having given you scripture that Jesus Himself says His followers will be kept out of the hour of the great trib.
You still cannot find any scripture that plainly outright states that born-again believers who have obtained salvation will suffer the great trib and you know you won’t find it.
Do you not see that you are basing all your posts only from your chosen position?  So far the only proofs you have shown is you have not accepted scripture truth given to you and that you either are not aware of the many facts that prove that a post trib view is diametrically opposed to the scriptures and history of the Jewish people laws and traditions that they all lived by for thousands of years or you refuse to accept it.
In addition the last trumpet spoken of by Paul is not in reference to the 7th trumpet in Rev as the book of Rev was written about 45+ years AFTER Paul wrote his writings , plus there is no mention of a last trumpet in Rev 11, nor does it even say a 7th trumpet , it is simply people suggesting that since there are only seeven angels the seventh must be the last trumpet , again the lack of understanding and having all the facts is why people are lead to misunderstandings . Since there is a lot to share this make take awhile .Also I should remind you of the origin of the word rapture , this is from a post earlier but it has been posted many times . It means to be snatched away . Phillip was not in a gathering or a harvest , he was snatched away without notice and taken to another location.
Harpazo is the original Greek word in scripture which was translated into Latin as raperium , rapiemur . rapio and then translated into English as rapture , they all mean the same thing referring to the sudden unexpected snatching away, catching away ,caught away suddenly by force and taken to another location
St. Jerome translated the Geek verb harpazo that Paul uses in 1 Thess 4:17 into the latin verb rapiemur back in about the year 400 and later on that latin verb was translated into the English as “caught up” or “caught away”
1 Thess 4:17 ” Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.”
In verse 18 we are to take comfort with the words he is teaching
Book of Acts 8:34-40
38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing
The story of Phillip baptism of the eunuch , read all verses 34-40 and notice that the words “caught away” in verse 39 are in the Greek writing of Acts 8:39 is Harpazo – identically exactly the very same word used in Thessalonians where Paul speaks of the rapture of the whole church.
in a split second as they come up out of the water Phillip is raptured -caught away -harpazo and taken to a city 30 miles away in a mere split second of time. Phillip did not take any means of human transportation , God snatched Phillip and placed him in a city 30 miles away .

I am about to show evidence that shows why a pre-trib rapture is distinctly supported by not only scripture but the Jewish history of over thousands of yearsThe the latin verb rapiemur was translated in to the word rapture by the early Protestants but all this means the same thing , simply just in a different language…and I shall look forward to dissecting your ‘proof’ :)………….See my post trib proofs at February 18, 2017 at 10:03 am. I also showed you Rev 12 ref which shows Michael WAS strong enough. Also you saying such things as “Jesus Himself says His followers will be kept out of the hour of the great trib.” – he actually only promised this to the church in Philadelphia AT THE TIME and it was a CONDITIONAL deliverance – you cannot extend this to apply to ALL BELIEVERS in ALL TIMES:-Rev 3
7 “To the angel of the church in PHILADELPHIA write:These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. 8 I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you HAVE KEPT MY WORD AND NOT DENIED MY NAME. 9 I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. 10 SINCE YOU HAVE KEPT MY COMMAND TO ENDURE PATIENTLY, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.On balance I suspect most will see that my scriptural references are more numerous and convincing than your own (at least the ones with open minds).Hi KevIf you would do a favor to yourself and simply revisit your studies so you can see in new light .
The name of the book of Rev originally was “The Book of the Revelation of Jesus the Christ”. It is Jesus having a 1 on 1 talk about the things to come just immediately prior to Jesus Return to earth which is why it is called Revelation as it is the Revealing of Jesus and the time of the end.
If you would study the 7 churches in Rev 3 you would learn that not only they existed in Johns time they are also used as a foreshadowing of the churches in the time of the end. Each of those 7 churches are a representation of how churches of the time of the end will be , you will have to study each of the 7 churches in order to learn this ,  . Most scholars believe we are in the time of the Laodicean church as referred in the txt as 3:15—
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.”
referring to the water of the area was such to spit it out — like room temp lukewarm
“Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see
Believers who think that because they are rich that they need nothing and do not even see how poor and wretched , miserable , blind and naked they really are . compare these things to the condition of modern day churches and they are just like that -promoting to ask -give me a $1000 and God will give you a 100 fold in return , homosexuality is accepted as being good in the church, adultry and all manner of sin is practiced by many pastors and clergy and the patrons as well  . In Rev 3:10 is Jesus telling ALL believers of ALL GENERATIONS that he will keep us OUT FROM the great trib.  Jesus is making it clear and concise and clarified that ” I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.It is specifically stating the
—“HOUR OF TRIAL that is GOING TO COME ON THE WHOLE WORLD TO TEST THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH ”
—
But yet you go way out on a weak limb to assume Jesus was speaking about one church in one city …that makes no sense unless you believe that the whole earth is that one church 🙂 🙂

Rememeber the vision that Daniel had about the statue of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream which represents several world empires would come to pass ? Some of them lasted several hundred years IIRC – the prophecy of the 7 churches is similar as in it takes a long period of time for this to take place . Again you misunderstand what you read . Even though I have to repeatedly remind you that it is ALWAYS GOD who decides who has power , how much power they have and how long they have it ,
As in the case when Daniel was telling a king that the hand writing on the wall was GOD saying to that king that he was taking his kingdomship away from him and giving it to someone else. You often read things into scripture that simply aren’t there or simply have a major misunderstanding of what you read.
. In the case of Micheal in Rev 12 what the prophecy is telling us is – as in other places in bible that there is coming a future time when the Son of Perdition/Antichrist will partner with the False Prophet/religious leader of the one world religion will appear on earth and be the leaders at the time of the great trib the time of the ‘hour of trial to come on the whole earth” and it will be satan incarnate in a human man
who wages war and that is when satan is thrown out of the heavens and no longer has access to go to the Throne of God to accuse the belivers of thier sins and that is when Michael is ALLOWED by God to cast satan down to earth because it is the proper time in GODs plan.
satan is actually known as ha-satan which mean -the accuser of the brethern- reporting to God of the sins of followers of God , consider the story of Job.
When the times comes that satan is thrown out of heaven he is thrown down to earth and the scripture tells us that satan is full of fury because he knows his time is short , all this is in Rev 12 . His time is short because as this is  the great trib and the human man antichrist and the false prophet are thrown into the lake of fire and satan is thrown into the abyss locked in chains for 1000 years , for 1000 years he will not be able to access mankind and unable to decieve any during that 1000 years.
At this current time satan still has access to go to Gods throne and bring accusations of belivers sins and will continue until the time has come in Gods plan. You often misinterpret the scriptures you provide .-  there are many other forums on the web that favor their own views , I can only pray that ppl will study and learn what I say can be proven , while you hang onto the top of the Empire State building pounding your chest like King Kong I can only pray that in time passing you will see that you make many errors as in your calling ppl who have a different view harlots, not something that Jesus would approve of . I will provide evidence of what the Last Trumpet is according to scripture as it relates to the Jewish people and their culture which is the proper way to see what scripture means , but first I will share provable information relating to the rapture that which shows the word “meet” is defined as you showed someone provided but it simply is the timing and other factors of the puzzle which you do not include and apparently you have not studied in order to learn the full meaning .
Have a great day!Just made a mind blowing discovery about Matt 24:36 which is translated in the NIV as
36 ‘But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,[f] but only the Father.
Not only is ‘KNOWS’ in the present tense (of when Jesus was speaking) there are some key Greek words which have been lost from the translation OUDE and OUDEIS (meaning NOT YET !!!)
If you look at the interlinear translation in scripture4all.org it reads:-
About YET the day that and the hour NOT YET ONE has perceived NOT YET the messengers of the heavens
Do you see what has been lost in translation ? Critical information !
This means that at some point in the future that day CAN BE KNOWN !!!Kev,Study the posts  I have made about the ancient Jewish Marriage and it should reveal a lot in this regard , the reference to ‘only the Father knows” is given by Jesus as it is something the the people was speaking to knew about very well as well as since the days are numbered as to how long the 7 year period is and the days of how long the great trib is , yes it is possible to know as the count down begins when the Restrainer steps aside and allows the Son of Perdition to be revealedBeginning  with the Jewish nation their culture is of the highest regard , it always has been dating back before Israel was a nation. Anyone familiar with bible prophecy knows there will be a temple built that will be involved in the great trib . Even before it is built the Jews have gone to extreme lengths to remake all of the furnishings to be exact as they were in biblical times . They do not want to use modern manufacturing processes to make the furnishings or the garments or even the harps that will be used in the temple services.
    Their heritage is so important to have everything exactly the way it was in biblical times they even use ancient methods to create the very special blue dye for the priests garments by finding a very special shell and crush it into a powder to create this blue dye. The Jews are very meticulous in the ways they carry on their heritage going to extreme lengths to make everything as authentic to the ancient days.
    When it came time to make copies of the Torah and other scrolls there are special laws that must be followed in every letter on the scrolls and if a mistake is made there are specific measures by law that must be done just to make the correction and if there is an error when writing the name of God there is a law that requires a special protocol to be followed and bury that scroll and a new scroll has to be made starting from scratch from the beginning regardless how close the document was to being complete. There is a lot more but I am laying the foundation pattern as to how critically important it is to the Jewish culture to be so meticulous as it is meant to be seen as reverence and obedience to God.
    –Moderators if you refuse to post my post  I will be in direct contact with Irvin to ask him why he allows moderators to be so prejudice against posts that have truth in themWe are taught many times throughout the bible how extremely important and highly regarded Marriage is , it is so highly held that if a women was found to have had sex without being married she was to be stoned to death. If man and woman were found together having had sex and not being married they were both stoned to death.
    God tells us that we should remain married until death , which shows the extreme high level of importance that marriage is unto God Almighty. In fact marriage is so highly regarded by God that he calls us His Bride and He is the Bridegroom. There will be an extremely high level of importance on the event called the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.–
    It was the culture custom of the Jewish ppl that when a man wanted a woman to be his bride he had to pay a price for her hand in marriage. A man had to buy/purchase/pay a ransom sum for his bride in order to marry her .(Jesus paid the ransom for you whom is called His bride) A man known as Jacob who God had given the name of Israel who is the man that the nation Israel is named after. When Jacob met Rachel he agreed to pay the price of working labor to her father for the term of 7 Years and then when Lavin her father deceived him as at the wedding he discovered it was not Rachel but her sister because of the veil on the bride.
    –
    Jacob truly loved Rachel and agreed to work another 7 Years of labor to pay for the price to have Rachel as his bride . Notice the 7 years themeThe theme of a 7 year time period is given throughout the bible and the culture of the Jewish people. Understanding Daniels 70th week clearly shows the last 7 is the last 7 years of human run government and the Son of Perdition/Antichrist and his partner the False Prophet are the leaders in this last 7 years. At the midpoint of the covenant that was confirmed the Son Of Perdition declares he is God which begins the “abomination that makes desolate” which is the start of the Great Tribulation, The beginning of this 7 year time frame is the same time period for when the Restrainer steps out of the way and allows the Son of Perdition to be revealed which begins Daniels 70th week. Just because the first half of this 7 year period may not be as destructive as the last half of the 7 there is no reason to pretend there is no tribulation in the first half of this 7. There is serious tribulation happening now in that part of the world and the 70th week has not yet begun , common sense tells us it will become worse when it does. The following I recieved in an email some years ago , I do not recall the author but the contents perfectly demonstrate how the pre trib rapture model is supported by scripture and the tradition and culture of the Jewish ppl and how it matches the psttern set forth by God Almighty in the manner of the Marriage covenant and the Jewish Marriage customs.JEWISH MARRIAGE CUSTOMS
    –
    It was a night of destiny. Jesus had gathered with His disciples in the Upper Room. In a few more hours He would be crucified on a cross. Jesus had been warning His disciples concerning His coming death, resurrection and ascension to heaven. The prospect of these events caused the disciples to be greatly disturbed. In order to ease their fears, Jesus made the following comforting promise:
    –
    Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, Believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there you may be also. (John 14:1-3.)The first major step in a Jewish marriage was betrothal.
    —
    1. Betrothal involved the establishment of a marriage covenant. By Jesus’ time it was usual for such a covenant to be established as the result of the prospective bridegroom taking the initiative.
    —
    2. The prospective bridegroom would travel from his father’s house to the home of the prospective bride. There he would negotiate with the father of the young woman to determine the price (mohar) that he must pay to purchase his bride.
    —
    3. Once the bridegroom paid the purchase price, the marriage covenant was thereby established, and the young man and woman were regarded to be husband and wife.
    —
    4. From that moment on the bride was declared to be consecrated or sanctified, set apart exclusively for her bridegroom.
    —
    5. As a symbol of the covenant relationship that had been established, the groom and bride would drink from a cup of wine over which a betrothal benediction had been pronounced.
    —
    6. After the marriage covenant had been established, the groom would leave the home of the bride and return to his father’s house. There he would remain separate from his bride for a period of twelve months.7. This period of separation afforded the bride time to gather her trousseau and to prepare for married life.
    —
    8. The groom occupied himself with the preparation of living accommodations in his father’s house to which he could bring his bride. At the end of the period of separation the groom would come to take his bride to live with him. The taking of the bride usually took place at night. The groom, best man and other male escorts would leave the groom’s father’s house and conduct a torch light procession to the home of the bride.
    —
    9. Although the bride was expecting her groom to come for her, she did not know the exact time of his coming.
    —
    10. As a result the groom’s arrival would be Preceded By a Shout.
    —
    11. This shout would forewarn the bride to be prepared for the coming of the groom. After the groom received his bride together with her female attendants, the enlarged wedding party would Return From the bride’s home to the Groom’s Father’s House.12. Upon arrival there the wedding party would find that the wedding guests had assembled already. Shortly after arrival the bride and groom would be escorted by the other members of the wedding party to the bridal chamber (huppah). Prior to entering the chamber the bride remained veiled so that no one could see her face.
    —
    13. While the groomsmen and bridesmaids would wait outside, the bride and groom would enter the bridal chamber alone. There in the privacy of that place they would enter into physical union for the first time, thereby consummating the marriage that had been covenanted earlier.
    —
    14. After the marriage was consummated, the groom would announce the consummation to the other members of the wedding party waiting outside the chamber (John 3:29). These people would pass on the news of the marital union to the wedding guests.15. Upon receiving this good news the wedding guests would feast and make merry for the next seven(7) days.
    —
    16. During the seven(7) days of the wedding festivities, which were sometimes called “the seven(7) days of the huppah,” the Bride Remained Hidden in the bridal chamber.
    —
    17. At the conclusion of these seven(7) days the groom would bring his bride out of the bridal chamber, now with her veil removed, so that all could see who his bride was.Earlier it was stated that in His promise in John 14 Jesus drew an analogy from Jewish marriage customs in biblical times. Now that the marriage customs have been considered, it is essential that the analogy be examined. In what ways was Jesus’ promise analogous with Jewish marriage customs? In the examination of the analogy the first thing that should be noted is the fact that the Scriptures regard the Church to be the Bride of Christ (Eph. 5:22-23). In addition, just as the Jewish bridegroom took the initiative in marriage by leaving his father’s house and traveling to the home of the prospective bride, so Jesus left His Father’s house in heaven and traveled to earth, the home of His prospective Church, over 1900 years ago.
    —
    In the same manner as the Jewish bridegroom came to the bride’s home for the purpose of obtaining her through the establishment of a marriage covenant, so Jesus came to earth for the purpose of obtaining the Church through the establishment of a covenant
    —
    On the same night in which Jesus made His promise in John 14 He instituted communion. As He passed the cup of wine to His disciples, He said: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood” (1 Cor. 11:25). This was His way of saying that He would establish a new covenant through the shedding of His blood on the cross.Parallel to the custom of the Jewish groom paying a price to purchase his bride, Jesus paid a price to purchase His bride, the Church. The price that He paid was His own life blood. It was because of this purchase price that Paul wrote the following to members of the Church: “know ye not that…ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and your spirit, which are God’s” (1 Cor. 6:19-20).
    —
    Analogous with the Jewish bride being declared to be sanctified or set apart exclusively for her groom once the marriage covenant was established, the Church has been declared to be sanctified or set apart exclusively for Christ (Eph. 5:25-27; 1Cor. 1:2; 6:11; Heb. 10:10; 13:12).
    —In the same way that a cup of wine served as a symbol of the marriage covenant through which the Jewish groom obtained his bride, so the cup of communion serves as the symbol of the covenant through which Christ has obtained the Church (1 Cor. 11:25).
    —
    Just as the Jewish groom left the home of his bride and returned to his father’s house after the marriage covenant had been established, so Jesus left the earth, the home of the Church, and returned to His Father’s house in heaven after He had established the new covenant and risen from the dead (John 6:62; 20:17).
    —
    Corresponding with the period of separation between the Jewish groom and bride, Christ has remained separate from the Church for over 1900 years. The Church is now living in that period of separation.Parallel to the custom of the Jewish groom preparing living accommodations for his bride in his father’s house during the time of separation, Christ has been preparing living accommodations for the Church in His Father’s house in heaven during His separation from His Bride (John 14:2).
    —
    In the same manner as the Jewish groom came to take his bride to live with him at the end of the period of separation, so Christ will come to take His Church to live with Him at the end of His period of separation from the Church (John 14:3).
    —
    Just as the taking of the Jewish bride was accomplished by a procession of the groom and male escorts from the groom’s father’s house to the home of the bride, so the taking of the Church will be accomplished by a procession of Christ and an angelic escort from Christ’s Father’s house in heaven to the home of the Church (1 Thess. 4:16).Analogous with the Jewish bride not knowing the exact time of the groom’s coming for her, the Church does not know the exact time of Christ’s coming for her.
    —
    In the same way that the Jewish groom’s arrival was preceded by a shout, so Christ’s arrival to take the Church will be preceded by a shout (1 Thess. 4:16).
    —
    Similar to the Jewish bride’s return with the groom to his father’s house after her departure from her home, the Church will return with Christ to His Father’s house in heaven after she is snatched from the earth to meet Him in the air (1 Thess. 4:17; John 14:2-3).
    —
    In the same manner as the Jewish wedding party found wedding guests assembled in the groom’s father’s house when they arrived, so Christ and the Church will find the souls of Old Testament saints assembled in heaven when they arrive. These souls will serve as the wedding guests.Parallel to the custom of the Jewish groom and bride entering into physical union after their arrival at the groom’s father’s house, thereby consummating the marriage that had been covenanted earlier, Christ and the Church will experience spiritual union after their arrival at His Father’s house in heaven, thereby consummating their relationship that had been covenanted earlier.
    —
    Corresponding with the Jewish bride remaining hidden in the bridal chamber for a period of seven(7) days after arrival at the groom’s father’s house, the Church will remain hidden for a period of seven(7) after arrival at Christ’s Father’s house in heaven. While the seven(7) year Tribulation Period is taking place on the earth, the Church will be in heaven totally hidden from the sight of those living on the earth.
    —
    Just as the Jewish groom brought his bride out of the bridal chamber at the conclusion of the seven(7) days with her veil removed, so that all could see who his bride was, so Christ will bring His Church out of heaven in His Second Coming at the conclusion of the seven(7) year Tribulation Period in full view of all who are alive, so that all can see who the true church is (Col. 3:4).the analogy is most significant also for those who have taken Christ to be Saviour. During the time of separation between the establishment of the marriage covenant and the coming of the
    bridegroom to take his bride, it was possible for the Jewish bride to commit adultery by giving herself to another man. In like manner it is possible for believers today to commit spiritual adultery against Christ before He returns to take His Church. Paul expressed concern over this possibility when he wrote the following to Christians:
    “For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ” (2 Cor.11:2-3).—
    James expressed the same concern when he rebuked Christians as follows: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” (James 4:4) The context of James’ statement indicates that spiritual adultery is committed when a believer becomes more devoted to the godless world system and the things that please it than he is to Jesus Christ and the things that please Him.Apologies….my post trib proofs seemed to have been shunted higher up out of immediate view due to multiple so called pre-trib ‘proofs’ relating to wedding customs being posted (by the way Sam and all pre-tribbers I have historically laid challenges out to…where are your (exegetically sound) ‘proofs’ ?). Here are mine again:-  If I highlight a word in capitals it will usually be because either (a) its a word indicating chronology or (b) its a word you might have mistaken ideas about or preconceptions about and you need to earnestly research (I have no time or inclination to do that for you). Also you need to understand that the word rapture doesn’t exist in the bible – it is variously referred to as “being caught up “, “harvest”, “being gathered” – if you can’t see that then there’s no point reading any further.
Anyway here goes:-
PROOF TEXTS #1
===============
The only one you should really need is in Matt 24 the words of Jesus himself (I have retained only the salient parts):-
15 ‘So when you see standing in the holy place “the ABOMINATION THAT CAUSES DESOLATION,”[a] spoken of through the prophet Daniel – let the reader understand – 21 For THEN there will be great DISTRESS, unequalled from the beginning of the world until now – and never to be equalled again.
29 ‘Immediately AFTER the distress OF THOSE DAYS
……
‘“the sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not give its light;
the stars will fall from the sky,
and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.”[b]
………..
31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will GATHER his ELECT from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
The order is clear
1)	ABOM OF DESOL
2)	TRIBULATION/PERSECUTION OF GOD’S PEOPLE
3)	6th SEAL SIGNS
4)	RESURRECTION/RAPTURE (SOME TIME AFTER)

Rev 20
And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They[a] HAD NOT WORSHIPPED THE BEAST or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. 5 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the FIRST resurrection.
1 Thess 4
15 According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that WE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will CERTAINLY NOT PRECEDE those who have FALLEN ASLEEP. 16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the TRUMPET CALL of God, and the DEAD in Christ will rise FIRST. 17 AFTER THAT, we who are STILL ALIVE and are left will be CAUGHT UP together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
These two scriptures put together give a clear order:-
1) Mark and beast
2) FIRST resurrection (of the dead in Christ)
3) Rapture (of the living in Christ)

2 Thess 2
2 Concerning the COMING of our Lord Jesus Christ AND our being GATHERED to him,…..
3 DON’T LET ANYONE DECEIVE YOU IN ANY WAY, for THAT day will not come UNTIL the rebellion occurs AND THE MAN OF LAWLESSNESS IS REVEALED.
Notice in particular that the TWO events (the COMING of our Lord AND or being GATHERED to Him) are referenced with THAT day (SINGULAR)…there is absolutely NO hint of these being TWO different days.
Note also the MAN OF SIN has to be HERE FIRST

For this next one there is no way around you simply accepting that the 7th trumpet is the Last Trumpet of 1 Corinthians…John and Paul didn’t need to discuss this with each other..the same Holy Spirit inspired boths writings (2 Tim 16 ALL Scripture is God-breathed ).
Now lets take it we all know that the last trumpet mentioned in Revelation is the 7th so lets go on to…
1 Cor 15
at the LAST trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the DEAD WILL BE RAISED imperishable, and we will be changed.
Also recalling…
1 Thess 4
15 According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that WE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will CERTAINLY NOT PRECEDE those who have FALLEN ASLEEP. 16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the TRUMPET CALL of God, and the DEAD in Christ will rise FIRST. 17 AFTER THAT, we who are STILL ALIVE and are left will be CAUGHT UP together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
Tells us the order:-
1) LAST (7th Trumpet)
2) FIRST resurrection (of the dead in Christ)
3) Rapture (of the living in Christ)
Rev 11
15 The SEVENTH angel sounded his TRUMPET, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said:
‘The kingdom of the world HAS BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS MESSIAH,
because you have taken your great power
and HAVE BEGUN TO REIGN
This clearly places the 7th trumpet at the end of the 7 years when Jesus takes up his millenial reign on earth.

36 ‘But about THAT DAY or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,[f] but only the Father. 37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the FLOOD came and TOOK THEM ALL AWAY. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
……….
43 But understand this: if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the THIEF was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into
Matt 25
25 ‘At THAT TIME the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
6 ‘At midnight the cry rang out: “Here’s the BRIDEGROOM! Come out to meet him!”
Notice how the above section knows NO concept of 2 or more distinct days of His coming …its all THAT day and THAT time …and we see judgment and rapture at the same time.

We are caught up “to meet” the Lord in the air at His 2nd Coming and conduct Him back to earth. The Greek word translated “to meet” is ‘Apantesin’. It is used in 3 places in the New testament. In Matt 25.6 it is used when the wise virgins go out “to meet” the bridegroom and conduct him back to the marriage.
The Holy Spirit chose this word here in 1 Thess 4:17 to prevent the idea that the believers would be caught up to meet the Lord and then go to heaven! We are caught up to meet the Lord and we must conduct Him back to earth!
Colin C
And here is what Strongs says about the word (G529):-
ἀπάντησις
the act of meeting, to meet
the act of meeting, to meet (a phrase …seemingly almost technical….. for the RECEPTION OF A NEWLY ARRIVED OFFICIAL).
Finally look at
Rev 16
12 The SIXTH angel poured out his BOWL on the great river Euphrates, ……………..
15 ‘Look, I come like a THIEF! Blessed is the one who STAYS AWAKE and REMAINS CLOTHED, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.’
16 Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
17 The SEVENTH angel poured out his BOWL into the air,
Notice when Rev places Jesus coming AS A THIEF (refer to the SINGULAR day mentioned immediately above in Matt 24/25)…between bowl 6 and 7 !!!!!
The final thing I will add about this proof text is that Rev 10 tells us that the 7th trumpet will sound for a NUMBER OF DAYS (I believe this will be sounding while the 7 bowls are being delivered). That way the rapture occurs at BOTH the 7th TRUMPET and the 7th BOWL !!!sorry forgot to include….Remember that Jesus spoke PERFECT tense (the perfect tense is past but has bearing on the present also) when he said “Of that day or hour no one knows (ie no-one knows SO FAR)…not the Son nor the angels but only the Father’…..the thing that will start the clock running will be the signing of the firm covenant (Israel/Palestine peace treaty). Once that is known then everyone with insight will know the day of the rapture – it will be 7 prophetic years later ( ie 3.5 prophetic years after antichrist comes out into the open (‘is revealed’) and proclaims himself God (the abomination of desolation) in the recently rebuilt 3rd Jewish temple).Regarding the THIEF:-
1 Thess
Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, 2 for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 3 While people are saying, ‘Peace and safety’, destruction will come on them suddenly, as labour pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
4 But YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, are NOT in darkness that this day should surprise you like a thief !
So only to the ungodly will it be a surprise !…..”oh yes but the preacher / my pastor says……” oh does he now ? Ever considered what might be the more popular /  profitable / worldly successful view (regardless of truth or ministers status) ?Colossians 3:4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, Then shall YOU ALSO APPEAR WITH HIM in GLORY
–
This is where the post trib camp had to come up with the idea that the rapture is going up then right back down , revealing a lack of understanding of Why there is a rapture .
–
Rev 3:10 Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you out from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
–
Even though Rev 3:10 speaks directly to the Great Tribulation ‘The hour of trial that comes upon the whole world’ post trib view is that this has already happened , though it has not happened yet
–
Even though I have a list of many scriptures that continually refer to how we will not suffer wrath , I will wait to post them and simply ask:
If the Antichrist reign was to begin next year what scripture do you have that Clearly ,Undeniably ,Irrefutably, Concisely states that those of us who have accepted salvation through Christ Jesus and have put our lives in Jesus hands , will go through the Great Trib
Not a verse that needs massaging or inference.

We cannot be two places at the same time , as we are coming down from the heaven with Jesus when Jesus appears to return to earth and put an end to the antichrists time on earthA popular belief is that the rapture and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ are two separate events divided by the duration of the tribulation.  On the contrary, the Bible shows us just the opposite.  Jesus said in Matthew 24:29-31, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”  According to Jesus, when He returns after the tribulation, He is also going to gather His elect, the church, at that time.  The apostle Paul addressed this on several occasions in his epistles.  In 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 he spoke of the rapture taking place as the Lord descended from heaven.  Many argue Jesus simply returns to the sky and turns right around; however, the Bible does not support this.  A belief like this would force us to believe in a two phase return of Christ, which is not Biblical.  Paul again in 2 Thessalonians 2:1-4 addresses the church concerning the coming of our Lord and our gathering together unto Him.  Paul continues to refer to these events as the day of Christ.  Apparently Paul believed and understood the rapture took place at the Second Coming.  Also when addressing the resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15, Paul spoke of the resurrection of those that are Christ’s at His coming in 1 Corinthians 15:23.  Knowing there is only one more coming of Christ, the Second Coming, we must agree the rapture will take place at that timeOk let the feasting commence…First off…
Colossians 3:4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, Then shall YOU ALSO APPEAR WITH HIM in GLORY
I think you’ve been listening to many pentecostal who use the word “glory” to refer to heaven.
The above scripture says nothing different to
 1 Cor 15:50-52:
50 I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 51 Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— 52 in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53 For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the MORTAL with IMMORTALITY.All the Colossians ref is saying is that we (our bodies will become glorified and we will be ‘clothed’ IN GLORY not that we will “go to heaven” at that point !)Next to why there is a rapture if we just come back down again…The purpose of the end time gathering (parable of the harvest) is a separation of the just from the wicked since immediately prior to Jesus return to rule and reign on earth there is still severest judgment to be served  upon the wicked………and the righteous are to be kept from that – specifically (the 7th bowl global catastrophe (as I see it ) PLUS Armageddon). Regarding Rev 3:10 I agree with you that the tribulation is yet future and so Jesus admirably fulfilled his promise to the PHILADELPHIAN church OF THE TIME to keep them from the “hour of trial” – end of story – you can’t extend this promise to any other group of people it was made to them alone.I wasn’t aware that any of my post trib proofs needed massaging or inference – I thought they were pretty direct, clear and self explanatory. Please indicate which ones I quoted you think needed massaging or inference ?Regarding scripture that believers will suffer at a/c’s hand:-
Daniel 7
25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
and speaking of the rise of the satanically inspired a/c beast in
Rev 12
17 Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring – those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.and just to show this persecution is not about so called post rapture tribulation saints…2 Thess 2
2 Concerning the COMING of our Lord Jesus Christ AND our being GATHERED to him,…..
3 DON’T LET ANYONE DECEIVE YOU IN ANY WAY, for THAT day will not come UNTIL the rebellion occurs AND THE MAN OF LAWLESSNESS IS REVEALED.So a/c HAS TO BE ON THE SCENE BEFORE THE GATHERING (RESURRECTION-RAPTURE) but NOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER a/c’s (at the abom. of desol.) appearing asMATT 24
15 ‘So when you see standing in the holy place “the ABOMINATION THAT CAUSES DESOLATION,”[a] spoken of through the prophet Daniel – let the reader understand – 21 For THEN there will be great DISTRESS, unequalled from the beginning of the world until now – and never to be equalled again.
29 ‘Immediately AFTER the distress OF THOSE DAYS
……
‘“the sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not give its light;
the stars will fall from the sky,
and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.”[b]
………..
31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will GATHER his ELECTThe distress (of ALL Gods people) is after abom of desol and before the gathering…We are not “coming down from the heaven with Jesus ” as we only get as far as the clouds and then come back down to earth in our glorified bodies to rule and reign with Christ (remember GLORY = HEAVEN is a man made inference).Regarding “the righteous are to be kept from that”…the righteous are kept from ALL God’s wrath pre bowl 7 its just that bowl 7 / Armageddon need us to be out of the way – they’re way too severe / cataclysmic.Regarding your comment “If the Antichrist reign was to begin next year”….technically the a/c beast won’t come out into the open until the midpoint of the ‘7’ (which hasn’t yet started) at the abomination of desolation. In other words…the absolute earliest he can start his reign is 3.5 prophetic years time from now.Do yourself a favor. Don’t read any comments but this one.
Every person here is dividing the body of Christ as false prophets do. Hypocrites and Pharisees the lot of them.Is the body of Christ divided?
1 Corinthians 1:13
“Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?”1 Corinthians 12:25
“so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.”And also2 Peter 1:20
“Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things.”DO NOT READ THESE COMMENTS!!!
These are false prophets and Pharisees.
Wolves in sheep’s clothing. Nothing more or less.God bless
MaranathaThe reason I ask IF THAT IF the great trib began next year was to see what scripture you had to prove we would go through it !! You don’t have any proof ! you have your opinion which is incorrect! Jesus Himself says:
 These things says He who is holy, He who is true, “He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens” 8 “I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name. 9 Indeed I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie—indeed I will make them come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.
10 Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. 11 Behold, I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown. 12 He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no more. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God. And I will write on him My new name.

If you would keep your children out from street traffic keep the safe from harm , why is is so hard to believe Jesus is telling you He will do the same for you ?Hi Sam,
 The tribulation and the wrath of God are two different events. The tribulation is a 3 1/2 time period with in the final seven years after the Abomination of Desolation. Jesus said in Matthew 24:15 that when you see this event flee for great tribulation would follow. 2 Thessalonians 2:Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
This scripture says Jesus will not return until after the man of sin is revealed. That happens at the Abomination of Desolation. Revelation 12:12 says the dragon is cast down to the earth and he is filled with great wrath because he knows his time is short. v.13 says at that point he begins to go after Israel.v14 says the woman is protected by the eagle for 42 months. 3 1/2 years. The wrath of the dragon is the great tribulation.
The Wrath of God comes after the church is raptured out. Revelation 16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. 20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
V.15 Is the rapture Jesus coming as a thief. And then His wrath begins. So we will be kept from Gods wrath. But we will be here for the tribulation.Hi Doug,
I disagree as that contradicts what Jesus says and there are NO scriptures that say in any way that those who have accepted the salvation of Jesus Before the Tribulation begins be in any part of it . It is God Himself who causes ALL wrath , God causes satan to be sent down to earth to begin Gods wrath with satan being the great delusion that is so convincing that he is God by the partnership with the false prophet causing miracles and great wonders like calling fire down from heaven upon command that those that rejected Christ will believe that satan is God as he says he is .There are many scriptures that refute the idea that WE will go through any wrath or Tribulation .
There are no scriptures that say we would be protected through it , But Jesus Himself says in a clear, concise , irrefutable manner that HE HImself will keep those who have kept the faith in Him “OUT FROM” “ek” that period of time .
your interpretation is simply missing all the other elements of scripture ,as it is irrelevant when the the Great Trib/Wrath begins or ends because HIMSELF tells us that HE will keep us out of it. Also there is NO Logic for Him to put those who are faithful to HIM in any part of it .
” 8 “I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name. 9 Indeed I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie—indeed I will make them come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you. 10 Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you “OUT FROM” the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. 11 Behold, I am coming quickly!

10 Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you “EK” the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. 11 Behold, I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crownDoug …for the most part I agree wih what you say but there are just a few details I need to clear up from what you said here…….Firstly Rev 12 doesn’t say that the Jewish remnant are protected by an EAGLE.
It says:-
Rev 12
14 The woman was given the TWO WINGS OF A GREAT EAGLE, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the snake’s reach. We constantly have to keep in mind when interpreting Revelation that John’s visions have strong connections to the Old Testament – in this case this is referring to :
Exodus 19
4 “You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on EAGLES’ WINGS and brought you to myself.In other words all it means is that this remnant will be supernaturally protected and provided for by God or an angel(s) during and after their ‘flight’.The next thing I need to address is the relative timing of things:According to Daniel 7:25
25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.…the allotted time of persecution was 3.5 prophetic years (1 + 2 + 0.5) however in Matt 24 Jesus says…
22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake THOSE DAYS SHALL BE SHORTENED….in order to be able to keep the promise to rapture out some alive.
What this means is that the 6th seal signs (the forewarning of all 7 bowls AND trumpet judgments – ALL GOD’S WRATH) comes in somewhere in the midst of the 3.5 years – this point in time will be reached when God decides there have been enough martyrs:-Rev 6
9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 10 They called out in a loud voice, “HOW LONG, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, UNTIL YOU JUDGE the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” 11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the FULL NUMBER of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters,[e] were killed just as they had been.The other thing that tells us that God’s wrath (trumpets + bowls) begins BEFORE the end of the 3.5 years is that trumpet 5 lasts FIVE MONTHS:-Rev 9
9 The FIFTH angel sounded his TRUMPET, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. 2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 3 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. 4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 5 They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for FIVE MONTHS.All in all all that I am saying here is  that God’s wrath must begin PART WAY IN of the final 3.5 years and even though A/C still ‘reigns’ for the full final 3.5 years the great tribulation / persecution is effectively over at that point as a/c focus has been forcibly directed elsewhere (by the devastation God’s wrath is bringing upon the earth). This is how saints will still be here ’til pre bowl 7 but no more get martyred. Saints are raptured near the very end for the very worst of the judgments – bowl 7 / Armageddon. You’ll notice that the trumpets only affect 1/3 and the bowls seem directed at the beast and his followers (so what’s so difficult about believing saints are still on earth during most of God’s wrath – simply protected by their seal – the Holy Spirit / blood of Jesus)Hi Doug,
To expand on this a bit , people of today who have accepted Christ salvation such as you and I will not enter in to the Great Trib/wrath time period , but there will be people who will accept Christ as savoir after the great trib begins, I can think of several reasons why this is as some people who have thought the bible is just a fictional story, but when the great trib begins they realize it is a True story and repent of their ways and accept Jesus as savoir , and it is they who will go through the great trib and many will be killed as martyrs as they will read Gods Word and see the Truth and choose to accept Jesus and reject the antichrist false godSam, I agree to disagree. Have a blessed day.Sam you say “there are NO scriptures that say in any way that those who have accepted the salvation of Jesus Before the Tribulation begins will have any part of it”I already showed this wasn’t true earlier as follows:-the following shows that the (one and only) rapture/gathering POST DATES  the man of sin appearing
…
2 Thess 2
2 Concerning the COMING of our Lord Jesus Christ AND our being GATHERED to him,…..
3 DON’T LET ANYONE DECEIVE YOU IN ANY WAY, for THAT day will not come UNTIL the rebellion occurs AND THE MAN OF LAWLESSNESS IS REVEALED.Now……the following post dates the rapture/gathering  to be EVEN AFTER  the distress/persecution on Gods people which occurs AFTER the man of sin is revealed (the latter occurring at the abomination of desolation)Matt 24
15 ‘So when you see standing in the holy place “the ABOMINATION THAT CAUSES DESOLATION,”[a] spoken of through the prophet Daniel – let the reader understand – 21 For THEN there will be great DISTRESS, unequalled from the beginning of the world until now – and never to be equalled again.
29 ‘Immediately AFTER the distress OF THOSE DAYS
……
‘“the sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not give its light;
the stars will fall from the sky,
and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.”[b]
………..
31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will GATHER his ELECTRegarding the “keep you from the hour of trial”…this is the last time I’m going to address you on this (repeating what I have said earlier):7 “TO the angel of the CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA write:These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. 8 I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet YOU HAVE KEPT MY WORD AND HAVE NOT DENIED MY NAME. 9 I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. 10 SINCE YOU HAVE KEPT MY COMMAND TO ENDURE PATIENTLY, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.This promise therefore can only be confidently claimed by the direct recipients (the Philadelphian church of the time) + even if at a stretch it could be extended to others… it is CONDITIONAL (conditions in capitals)
(how many of us can claim to fulfil all these conditions – also their faith was being severely tested at the time they were meeting this condition – are we today in the west being so severely tested ??)Note also however that the “hour of trial” will test THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH. This to me is not speaking of the wrath of Satan (persecution of Gods people) but rather the wrath of God (directed at the earths inhabitants). This is no more than we’d expect (i.e to be protected from Gods wrath if we are faithfully, patiently waiting for Jesus return).Also you say the word EK (“OUT FROM”)…actually the two words are used….TERERESO EK the former word being strongs G5083 which means “to watch over, protect, guard” – why the the need to do so if we are taken away ???+
see the attached link to see how those closest to Jesus were ‘spared’…http://www.bibleprobe.com/apostles.htmKev
How it is that you still do not see?
“HAVE KEPT MY WORD AND HAVE NOT DENIED MY NAME.” This means that the people who have stayed faithful to Jesus and Not denied the name of Jesus..Jesus will keep those people OUT FROM the great trib and all wrath
–
 10 “SINCE YOU HAVE KEPT MY COMMAND TO ENDURE PATIENTLY,”  mean the same thing those who have been faithful to Jesus -I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the WHOLE WORLD to test the INHABITANTS of the EARTH

Understand this is PROPHECY ABOUT THE TIME JESUS RETURNS TO EARTH!!
PROPHECY ABOUT THE TIME
-JESUS RETURNS TO EARTH!!
–
PROPHECY ABOUT THE TIME JESUS RETURNS TO EARTH!!
-you really need to do a deep study on way those 7 churches are in a PROPHECY ABOUT THE TIME JESUS RETURNS TO EARTH!!The first chapter of the Book of Revelation begins by saying,
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw… (Rev. 1:1-2)
In the eighth verse a voice spoke to John and said,I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord which is and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.The scripture tells us it is the Lord speaking. So, it is apparent John understood who he was hearing from – the Lord, the Almighty.
Notice what happens next in verses 9-11:
I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. I was in the Spirit on the Lord‘s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
These were the seven churches in Asia in John‘s day. In this passage, John is writing of ―things which are‖. After his escape from the isle of Patmos, John went back to the mainland, and, according to history, was the overseer of those seven churches. He took the messages back to the churches to help them become what God intended them to be.
Verses 12-18 give us a detailed description of Jesus Christ as He appeared to John. Here the Lord shows Himself to be more than just a man. He was the first and the last, the Almighty.
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not: I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
The Mystery of the Stars and Candlesticks
Revelation 1:20 concludes by Jesus revealing to John the identity of the seven stars and the seven candlesticks.
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.Jesus says the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. The original Greek meaning for ―stars‖ is ―messenger‖ or ―pastor‖. In biblical times, people used the stars to give them direction when they traveled on land or by sea. The stars led them to their destination. In the same way, God gives us pastors to lead and direct our churches. The seven stars in the hand of Jesus Christ were the messengers or pastors of the seven churches of Asia.
Next, John is told that the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. Jesus said to us, ―ye are the light of the world.‖ A God-ordained church is spoken of as a candlestick that shows the light of God to the world.An Important Question
Are the messages to the seven churches prophetic? It has been commonly taught that they are, and that each church mentioned in this passage represents a church age. Remember, it isn‘t until Revelation 4:1 that John is told,
Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.
Jesus finishes talking about the seven churches in the last verse of chapter three. So, the prophecies don‘t begin until verse 1 of chapter 4.
You will notice throughout the Bible that most of the books of the New Testament were addressed to specific churches, such as Galatia and Corinth. However, if you will study the messages to those seven churches, they could be applied to many of our churches today. For some churches, the message to the Ephesian church could apply. Many have left their “first love”. Others fit the description of the church of Sardis having “… the name that thou livest but art dead”. They are called Christian, but they are lifeless, lacking the power of God in their lives. Perhaps the most disturbing message was the one given to the Laodicean church. Jesus said, “I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” A church cannot afford to be lukewarm in the end times.
Seven Church Ages?
Here is a brief explanation of how the belief that the seven churches represent seven church ages came about. In the back of a Thompson-Chain Bible, there is a chart that lists all the churches of Revelation 1:11. It equates the conditions existing in the Ephesian Church to the late Apostolic Age; the conditions existing in the Smyrna Church to the early centuries of persecution; the conditions in the Church of Pergamos to the age of Constantine and Temple prosperity caused by a marriage of church and state. It equates the Church of Thyatira with the age of papal apostasy and the Dark Ages; the Sardis Church with the church of the Middle Ages; and the Philadelphia Church with the church of the Reformation in Martin Luther‘s day. Finally, the Laodicean Church is believed to be the church of the last days.
However, there is absolutely no proof for these beliefs. Those were simply seven messages to the seven churches of John‘s day, and all of those messages can be preached in our churches today. Although this isn‘t a heaven or hell issue, it is important for us to understand the chronology and order of the Book of Revelation in order to understand the Book of Revelation.Just looked that up and you are mistaken

http://www.sacrednamebible.com/kjvstrongs/STRGRK50.htmDoug…absolutely…the idea of a ‘particular church age’ eg Laodicean age is nonsense since in any given point in time there will always be a mix of church types around the world e.g. lukewarm (not invariably though) in the more affluent parts of the world and fiery hot (though again perhaps not invariably) in the persecuted churches of the world……..dispensationalists really do love to box things off neatly …Sam …I just clicked both your G5083 links and neither contradict me ….Sam…regarding your insistence that the message to the churches is meant to be about the future I see the pivotal part of Dougs reply to be “Remember, IT ISN’T UNTIL Revelation 4:1 that John is told,
Come up hither, and I will shew thee THINGS WHICH MUST BE HEREAFTER.
Jesus finishes talking about the seven churches in the last verse of chapter three. So, the prophecies DON’T BEGIN UNTIL 1 of chapter 4.”HEREAFTER is another word for FUTURENot anyone knows the day or the year week stop trying to predict the rapture.Hello Eric, you are right, no man knows the day or hour. However the Lord did give us signs to look for in Matthew 24:4-31 and much of Daniel and Revelation.That was the best answer a post tribber can give , as there is no scripture evidence to offer in support of that  view , The signs that are given pertain to when the ‘season’ when the Lord comes to rule such as the rebirth of Israel letting us know the time is near , but there are no signs given pertaining to th e rapture ..Have a blessed dayDoug If you you do not post my posts I will be in contact with Irvin to ask him why the mod team will not post my post
Have a blessed day 🙂Sam did you read the article? Why is this something that you want to go back and forth about? It is not a salvation issue. I have hundreds of comments, emails and phone calls to answer every day. Brother Baxter teaches a post tribulation rapture. He backs up his view with scripture. You disagree. Okay. God bless you sir. Continue on in your learning and understanding and may the Lord bless and keep you, my brother.A very biased and prejudicial moderator on this site !!!apologiesSam – my first post on this website was on October 10, 2013. There has been several Moderators since then and none have been more interactive and with more accurate information than what Doug has, and especially about major salvation issues such as what Jesus disciples said about what it takes to be saved, which they preached for the first time in Acts 2:38, and also in Acts 8:14, Acts 9:18, Acts 10:47:48, Acts 16:15, Acts 16:33, Acts 18:7-8, Acts 19:3-5, Acts 22:16. Your apology to Doug was in order.
Also – if you haven’t been baptized in Jesus Name, call End Time at 800-363-8463, tell them where you live, and likely Dave Robbins will tell you a Church near you that will do that, and you will likely be baptized with the Holy Ghost before you leave. Any Catholic Church will not do it – they declared Jesus Name baptism to be invalid in the New Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume 2, page 66, also in chapter 7 of the 16 Chapter Catholic Didache, and in Catholic Catechism 1240, 1256, and 1276 to name a few. Most Protestant Churches will tell you that water baptism was not done in Jesus Name, or that water baptism isn’t necessary to be saved.
Dave SchellerDave,
I am not catholic believer
I highly encourage people to receive a water baptism , however it gets mistakenly believed that it is the water baptism that saves their spirit/soul and that is not accurate.
Baptism is an outward proclamation of an inward conversion.
In the OT there was a understanding of baptism in having to “bathe” before putting on sacred garments even if they had bathed shortly beforehand.
–
Jesus taught to be baptised in The Name of the Father , The name of the Son, and the Holy Spirit , . Before Jesus came wter baptism was how man displyed his dedication ;Water baptism is a way of showing publicly that a person has accepted the Gift of Salvation from Jesus through Jesus paying the price of sins , which the price of sins is death . Jesus paid that price for us .
To be “Saved” is to be “born-again” as Jesus taught . Have you ever heard a pregnant woman say her water has broke ? it is by water that humans are born in the flesh , and by being born-again in the Holy Spirit is how a person enters the Kingdom of God.

As Doug has said — the harpazo/rapture- is Not a salvation issue , salvation comes when

John 3 3 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.
10 “You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and do you not understand these things? 11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.

16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.

Romans 10
): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.”12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

There was a man hanging on the cross next to Jesus who acknowledged that Jesus is who he said He is , and asked Jesus to remember him when Jesus went to His Kingdom and that man was with Jesus in Paradise that very day
God Bless youHey Sam, this is a very different topic. This is a salvation issue. This is what we need to be sure we get right. Lets look again at what is being said in John 3. Jesus said in v3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
Notice “Born Again” a second birth is the topic of discussion. V4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? Still talking about second birth. V5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Still talking about second birth when He said Water and Spirit. Jesus is not talking about fluid in a mothers womb.
Jesus is talking about water Baptism and being filled with the Holy Spirit.
And when Jesus gave the great commission, it is recorded in Mark and Luke as well as Matthew 28:19. Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 to baptize in the Name (singular) not names. Of the Father,Son and Holy Ghost. MARK 16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.( Believes and is Baptized)
17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;(Notice in my Name).
18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
LUKE 24:46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.48 And ye are witnesses of these things.49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.(Repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name). The Apostles knew the Name. That is why in Acts 2:38 Peter full of the Holy Ghost, so GOD’s spirit was in Peter and he was speaking in the Holy Ghost authority said: ACTS 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. (The scripture says baptism in JESUS name remits or takes away your sins) this is what scripture says and this is what Jesus said in Mark and Luke. ROMANS 6:Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
So what Peter taught was the same thing Jesus talked about in Luke 24. That He Jesus would suffer and rise again. This is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Here is what Paul said about it: 1 Corinthians 15:1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
Paul say the gospel that saves you is the Death, Burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. and Peter said to obey that by Repenting= Death to self, Burial + Baptism in Jesus, Resurrection=Receiving the Holy Ghost. and this is not works as some would like to say, TITUS 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Washing of regeneration (Born Again of Water and the Spirit).Doug,
You make assumption of things that are not said , I in no way said the scripture spoke of the water of the womb , it was to help understand an analogy that you apparently did not understand.
I did  not say Jesus said anything about the fluid in a mothers womb nor did I say that scripture . It was said only to help understand an analogy, really all I can do is laugh at your silly tangent while you miss the point entirely.
If you get water baptism every day of your life that alone WILL NOT SAVE YOU!!!

The entry level teaching JOHN3:16!!
If I said the blood of the cross is what saves people , you would interpret that as the cross itself was bleeding blood rather to acknowledge that the statement is directly referring to Jesus shed blood on the cross is what saves people; IF.. they accept that the shed blood of the messiah provides the way into theKingdom. Jesus main purpose in becoming a man was to be the sacrificial lamb to give mankind the bridge into the kingdom, second was to spread the message that what He accomplished by shedding His blood provides the pathway to eternal life.
–
It is all about the blood ,the blood ,the blood ,the blood  The shed blood of Jesus the Messiah , Jesus the Chosen One , Jesus the Anointed One, You either must not believe in the Holy Trinity or do not really understand who it is .
–
The gospel is literally the Good News of Jesus the Christ ,the reason is Because He shed HIS INNOCENT Blood for you , If that blood was not shed you could not be saved! No matter how many times you get baptized with water.
Jesus IS the Father , Jesus IS the Son of God and the person of the Holy Spirit Thee Holy Trinity
–
The reason Jesus was hated by Jews is that they knew Jesus claimed to be God and to their laws anyone who claims that or claims to be the Son of God is in blasphemy which is why they wanted to stone him to death and persisted unto crucifixion
–
Don’t get misled ,  mankind is all born into sin which is why a sinless person shed HIS blood to pay the price , as it is said the wages of sin is death , the ONLY way to the kingdom is accepting Jesus as Lord and live according to HIS WORD , tradition will not save you ONLY the shed blood of the Lamb which paid for all mankind’s sin and provides redemption
IF a person accepts it they will be saved . The baptism of the Holy Spirit has nothing to do with water
You must be careful and do not rush to assumptions, If you think someone means somethings other than what scripture teaches , ask first before making rash assumptionsSam – there wasn’t a place to reply to your post below so I put it here.
Sam – Jesus said in Matthew 28:19,”Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name OF the Father, and OF the Son, and OF the Holy Ghost.” Father is a title and not a name, Son is a title and not a name, Holy is an adjective and Ghost is a noun. Just before Jesus ascended into heaven – Luke 24: 45 says that Jesus OPENED THEIR UNDERSTANDING, which means that His disciples knew exactly what Jesus meant when they baptized in His name. At no time did His disciples ever use the words Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or any combination of those words in one sentence regarding water baptism, or any other topic in the New Testament. You said,”… it gets mistakenly believed that it is water baptism that saves their soul/spirit, and that is not accurate.” The following scriptures prove that is a false statement – Acts 4:8,”Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them…”, being filled with Holy Ghost he could not have been making any mistakes, he said in 1 Peter 3:21,”The like figure where unto even BAPTISM DOES ALSO NOW SAVE US….” which it does so because it REMITS SIN. Peter also said in Acts 2:38-39,”Repent and be baptized every one in the name of the Jesus Christ, FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. (39) For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” That means that promise is just as valid today as it was back then. Also – Jesus said in Mark 16:16,”He that believes and is BAPTIZED shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be damned.” Jesus explained what damned means in Matthew 13:49-50,”So shall it be at the end of the world, the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, (50) And shall cast them into the furnace of fire, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” He also said in Mark 9:43-44,”It is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that is never quenched. (44) Where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.” You addressed John 3:3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18 – Jesus said in John 3:7,”You MUST be born again.” In John 3:5 He said, “Except a man be born of water and of the spirit he can not enter into the Kingdom of God.” It doesn’t make sense and it isn’t logical that He is referring to the water that happens when everyone is born. Note that is the same John that went with Peter to Samaria in Acts 8:14-17,”Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: (15) Who, when they were come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost: (16) For as yet he was fallen on none of them, only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. (17) Then they LAID THEIR HANDS ON THEM and they received the Holy Ghost.” Note it says they received the word of God, meaning they were BELIEVERS, which means that just because they were believers did not mean they were saved and just because they were believers did not mean they had the Holy Ghost. The same situation happened in Acts 19:1-7 when Paul met 12 men in Ephesus, in verse 2 he asked them if they had received the Holy Ghost since they BELIEVED, in verse 3 they said they had not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost, in verse 4 Paul asked them how they were baptized, they said unto John’s baptism (John the Baptist), in verse 5 Paul baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in verse 6 Paul LAID HANDS ON THEM and the Holy Ghost came on them, and they SPOKE WITH TONGUES and prophesied.” That also proves that just because they were believers did not mean they automatically were saved and just because they were believers did not mean they automatically had the Holy Ghost. Also note that in the scriptures you mentioned in John – and also includes any other scriptures in Matthew, Mark, and Luke where Jesus said what we must do while he was still alive and before he was crucified – HE WAS NOT FINISHED SPEAKING YET. After he rose from the dead and just before he ascended into heaven, he said what he did above in Mark 16:16, which is,”He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be damned.” You referenced Romans 10:9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 – another scripture that many often use to try to justify why they don’t need to be baptized in Jesus Name is Ephesians 2:4,”For by grace are you saved through faith, and not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.” Note that it was Paul that wrote Romans and Ephesians – Paul was baptized by Ananias in Jesus Name in Acts 9:18, Paul was baptized with the Holy Ghost when Ananias laid hands on him in Acts 9:17, Paul baptized Lydia and all of her household in Acts 16:15, Paul baptized the Jailer after he asked what he needed to do to be saved in Acts 16:33 – which he did in the middle of the night and that included all of his household, Paul baptized Justus in Acts 18:7, Paul baptized Crispus and many Corinthians in Jesus Name in Acts 18:8, Paul baptized the 12 believers in Acts 19:5. When Paul wrote to the Romans and the Ephesians, he was speaking to people that he and the other disciples had already baptized in Jesus Name and laid hands on them to receive the Holy Ghost. Paul said in Galatians 1:8-9,”But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” Paul was so adamant about that, that he repeated himself in verse 9,”As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be ACCURSED.” Paul explained what accursed means in 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9,”In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: (9) Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.”
Regarding the thief on the cross next to Jesus and not being baptized (Luke 23:33-34) – at that time Jesus had not yet given the commandment to be baptized (Matthew 28:19 and Mark 16:16) until after he had risen from the dead and just before he ascended into heaven. The thief on the cross or anyone else at that time did not know about being baptized in Jesus Name, or about being baptized with the Holy Ghost, and therefore would not have done it. Please see my post in “What Do You Mean Born Again?”, titled “Water Baptism In Jesus Name”. Part 1 of 3 on December 15, 2016 at 9:10 am, Part 2 on December 15, 2016 at 9:05 am, and Part 3 on December 15, 2016 at 8:14 am – which explains much more about this topic. Please also see my post in “Was Jesus The Messiah?” titled “Jesus Is More Than The Son Of God” on June 1, 2016 at 9:14 am. There is many scriptures there from Deuteronomy 6:4 to Revelation 21:6-7 which gives some important information about who Jesus really is that few people know about, and also proves that we get the Father in the name Jesus, the Son in the name Jesus, and the Holy Ghost in the name Jesus. Also – Irvin Baxter has some excellent 1 hour DVDs on this topic in the Salvation Package, which is “Understanding The Godhead”, “True vs False Christianity”, “Born Again – Three Steps”, and “Receiving The Holy Ghost”. As with all of Irvin’s DVDs , he has the scriptures on the screen as he is speaking so the person viewing them can verify that what he is saying is true.
God Bless you also.If you get water baptism every day of your life that alone WILL NOT SAVE YOU!!!

This is something that various people say means a variation of things yet all similar.

Which is why I was trying to be short and to the point , that if a person does repent and asks God for forgiveness and begins to live according to how Jesus taught to live , but does not get a water baptism it will not prevent them from entering the kingdom , Just as many people do not understand that Jesus fulfilled the Law of the 10 commandments as they do not realize that only Jesus is able to do so , see the scriptures sometimes elude to something that is to come but yet is not called a prophecy though technically they are , the first prophecy of the bible was stated in Genesis but was not technically called a prophecy
If Jesus had not come to earth to die for mankinds sins there would be no remission of sins for anyone ; which is why Herod under the influence of satan wanted to kill all the children 2 years of age and under in an attempt to prevent the savoir from providing a way to be redeemedHello Sam, I’m sure you have seen this, but do you agree with it?
https://www.endtime.com/how-do-i-become-a-christian/
I am honestly asking, in brotherly love. Our main goal here is to seek and save the loss. So I take my position here very seriously. I do not want to argue or debate, but if I believe someone to be seeking truth I will try and help them understand why we believe what we teach.Doug,
I am a Christian , born-again in the the salvation of Jesus , baptized in water , and do extensive studies in God Holy Word,
–
I give verifiable evidence that is true , now if you choose to believe that a person is not saved , or will not be accepted into the kingdom simply cause they did not have a traditional water baptism that is on you to decide for your own heart , but when you start to espouse that any person is not saved because they did not have a water baptism or say that it is the baptism is what saves people you have gone into an area of religious false teaching.
–
The mere notion that a person can be saved only because of water baptism is 100% false !
–
I said in my first post that I highly encourage that people get a water baptism , I am for it all the way , but simply making a clarifying statement that the water baptism is just a symbolic representation of having sins wahing away because of the blood of Jesus on cross , It is symbolic representation of something Jesus did ,as such a the water baptism does NOT save anyone from anything.
ONLY the blood of the Lamb of God saves!!!  John 3:16!!
–
In the OT there were animal sacrifices that were to atone for sins , since Jesus became the sacrificial lamb the animal sacrifices are no longer needed
The reason why there are many difrent denomintions sis simply because there were men that chose to interpret scripture to mean something other than what was taught where they attended and chose to start their own church,
In one such denomination they place a very high priorty on the excat date of when a person got saved , if a person does not recall the excat date they are considered to be not saved , craziness , If a new person visits their church and are greeted by a church member usually staff they will take it upon themselves to ‘evaluate’ and asess if the new person is a Christian by asking certain questions , It is not proper to act superior and asees if another is Christain by saying they must fit the criteria of a denomination , but it happens all the time.
–
In the ‘upper room’ when the baptism of the Holy Spirit came down on those in the room it was like unto fire ….water was not involved in this matter ,
Matthew 3:11
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but HE that cometh after me is Mightier than I, Whose shoes I am NOT WORTHY to bear: HE shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire
–
Notice that John the Baptist did baptize Jesus with water ,,certainly you would not believe that Jesus got saved through that water baptism ???
Jesus who shed His blood for the remission of sins , replaced the practice of shedding the blood of animals for atonement
–
You don’t hear of people baptizing themselves in their own bathtubs or showers at home , baptism is done in public as symbolism that what they have chosen in their heart is now represented to the public .
If a person really believes that if they get sprinkled with water or tank of water ; that the water is what saves them then they really need a teaching to learn why Jesus shed His Innocent blood on the crossSam, I have never said that water baptism only saves you. What I have done is shown you scripture that says it is to remit your sins. You can decide from that point what you need to do. Scripture says, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” The scripture plainly says what baptism is for. The reason why we should baptize in the NAME, is because JESUS is the one who died and shed his blood. Scripture says without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. That scripture says Jesus Name baptism remits sin. So I’m teaching truth not false teaching. I am sorry you disagree with what the word says. But this Acts 2:38 plan of Salvation was given to Peter who had the keys to Kingdom. The keys open the Kingdom up to everyone. Jesus himself said you must believe and be baptized. So once again we are at a disagreement. So if you are coming here teaching some other doctrine then the one the Bible teaches, I am sorry, but I will not waste anymore time going back and forth with you. God bless you.Dave,
John the Baptist was baptizing people before Jesus started His ministry on earth,
DaveS said
“Regarding the thief on the cross next to Jesus and not being baptized (Luke 23:33-34) – at that time Jesus had not yet given the commandment to be baptized (Matthew 28:19 and Mark 16:16) until after he had risen from the dead and just before he ascended into heaven. The thief on the cross or anyone else at that time did not know about being baptized in Jesus Name, or about being baptized with the Holy Ghost, and therefore would not have done it.”
–
John the Baptist ,baptized Jesus at the very beginning of Jesus earthly ministry , and everyone throughout Jesus ministry knew it and so did the thief on the cross as the other thief on the other side of Jesus denied Jesus as the Son of God , you simply have misunderstood that baptizing was a common regular practice throughout Jesus ministry from the beginning
–
I am well aware of the difference between a title and a name, the point Jesus is making is to recognize HIM, and give HIM the glory , whether you call the name YHWH, Yeshua, Yaweh ,I AM THAT I AM, Yahshua or the hundred other ways to spelled it , and also Immanuel,
God Bless1 Corinthians 1- Paul says
14 I Thank God that I did Not Baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
–
Paul was addressing the problems of division in the church , but notice he says he thanks God he only baptized a couple people and not the rest of them
–
IF baptism was an absolute requirement for salvation he would not have said these things

It would seem that according to the posts I see here you must subscribe to a mans interpretation called baptismal regeneration where they teach baptism is an absolute requirement for salvation which undermines Jesus shed blood and is an attack on the sufficiency of the death and resurrection of Jesus being as not being sufficient to obtain salvation of Jesus blood on the cross adding mans extra requirement to be saved.
I do not agree with baptismal regeneration1 Corinthians 1:For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;15 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
This scripture is not down playing the importance of baptism in anyway. The church was divided by believers that claimed they were baptized by someone more important or holy than the other. Paul shows the importance of baptism when he says “was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?” Because he was stressing to the church that Jesus was the one who died for them, the one who’s blood covers their sins. He is saying it doesn’t matter who baptized, what matters is who you are baptized into. This is the same reason he said in Romans 6:3 Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?  4 Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.5 For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection,  6 knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.Notice that John the Baptist did baptize Jesus with water ,,certainly you would not believe that Jesus got saved through that water baptism ???
Jesus who shed His blood for the remission of sins , replaced the practice of shedding the blood of animals for atonement
–
You don’t hear of people baptizing themselves in their own bathtubs or showers at home , baptism is done in public as symbolism that what they have chosen in their heart is now represented to the public .
If a person really believes that if they get sprinkled with water or tank of water ; that the water is what saves them then they really need a teaching to learn why Jesus shed His Innocent blood on the cross
To say that a person is not ‘saved’ if they have not had a water baptism even though they have ask God to forgive them of their sins , they have repented and accept Jesus died and rose again to pay the price of sins for them ,,then you are saying that Jesus shedding his blood and dying on the cross and raising to life again is not good enough for you , a 100% perfect sinless Creator shed His blood for you and you feel that is not good enough to be saved , that you insist that they have to have a sinful human person put water on you is and Insult to Jesus and you will answer to Him to why you believe Jesus shedding His blood was not good enough for you  , and to add insult to that is that you are giving man the power to cause a person to be saved by insisting that unless man pour water people are not saved!!
========================================================================Sam, when a person repents, they are forgiven. But their sins are still on there account. The bible clearly says baptism in Jesus name remits our sins.  It takes them off our account.It can not be any clearer. 1 Peter 3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: A clear conscience toward God, means we do not have to be condemned in front of God. It is that simple. Why would anyone not want to do it.Why is it that want to control what people see ?
Acts 10
43 All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”

44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message

Mark 16
16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18 they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.
–
Get it ?? He who BELIEVES and is baptized will be saved. 2—HE Who Does Not Believe will be Condemned.
–
Get It ? It says that you can be baptized , but if you do not BELIEVE , you are condemned
Point blank telling you that baptism by itself is of no value and does Nothing!

John 3:16
16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only SonActs 10:47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.(He Commanded them, not suggested).
Your Mark 16:16 comment, if you do not believe, why would you get baptized? Jesus says Believes and is Baptized!
John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. V.5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.This discussion on baptism should be easy to understand without a debate , Firstly I have been in many Protestant Churches as there are many denominations that are in this catagory , Actually most of America is in some form of Protestant Church- google a list of them, and EVERY one of them have baptismal services;
. How often they have the service depends on how many people will partake as there are preparations that are needed to be done in modern day churches as most do not go to a river to do their baptismal services.
Often the question on whether or not a baptism is necessary to be saved arise out of the questions about what is done or not done as a result of a baptism and if a person who is so ill/immobile they cannot go anywhere to be baptized
There are variations of this as MANY people will accept Jesus as Lord & Savoir by acccepting John 3:16 and asking for forgiveness and choose to live for Christ but not immediately get baptized , it may be months or longer before they do.
It would be a shame if people taught that if a person accepts Jesus gift of salvation and died without a baptism that the person would not be accepted into the Kingdom. The Protestant Churches that I have been in do not teach that baptism is not needed , rather the focus is to show what is absolutely needed which is to repent and ask Jesus be Lord & savoir of their life , for what is accomplished if a person gets baptized and does not believe Jesus died and rose from the grave to give eternal life ?
Nothing because baptism is an affirmation of what has occured in the heart , baptism itself without salvation is like shoelaces without the shoe . People in biblical times mostly got baptised as they accepted Jesus as Lord as in their day they often lived miles from a church and it could take a day(s) of walking to get to a church service so they accepted baptism when it was available
In more than 40+ years I rarely hear of anyone who chooses not to be baptised for if they did they would be asked why do they choose not to , there is no logical supporting reason not to and very good reasons to be baptised. I have not heard any Protestant Church that would down play baptism and teach it not to be necessary except to clarify that if a person did not get baptised but accepted Jesus as personal Lord and savoir and died it would not prevent them from being accepted into the kingdom.
This is something that people should be careful to recognize that it can offend believers , like unto whether or not a person is dunked in water tank or get sprinkled ; sure the water tank looks more like a person dying to self and rising to life when dunked in a tank but some people cannot physically accommodate this . It is silly to debate being sprinkled vs. being dunked in a tank of water as both accomplish the same.
A blanket statement that Protestant Churches say that water baptism is not necessary to be saved is something that causes people to be offended because this statement does not include any detail on why anyone would say that as I have never heard any Protestant Church teach anything that says not ot be baptised or don’t bother to do it because every Protestant Church I have been in will teach to repent and be baptised , among the various denominations there are different points of view on details as they do on various aspects of scripture , Please for the sake of all brethern try to understand what is taught in Protestant Churches before making presumptions , the reason so many denominations exist is because people expect everyone to walk heel to toe the same , when people study the topic fully enough there is no dispute on what scripture says
God Bless everyoneI would like to share a perspective on this matter that hopefully will make the matter a little more transparent. I also am not inclined to get into a ongoing debate simply want to show something that should help
I truly say this in brotherly love…. that  for anyone to say ” that just because they were believers did not mean they were saved and just because they were believers did not mean they had the Holy Ghost.”   A Believer Is ‘Saved ‘ Yes indeed , They do have the Holy Spirit residing in them , but it does not necessarly mean thay have received the Gifts of the Holy Spirit  that comes when they are recieve the baptism of the Holy Spirit .- Just because a person has not recieved the Gifts of the Holy Spirit does not mean they are not saved , because they Are Saved
Mark 16:16 Whoever Believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
John 3 16
For God so loved the world ……….whoever Believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.   17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to Save the world Through Him
18 Whoever Believes in Him is NOT condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.
If a person does a deep study on these scriptures it is very clear , a Believer is Saved a unbeliever is Not Saved
I want to keep this breif as possible – a Believer is a person who has accepted John 3:16-18 , they have confessed with their mouth audibly that Jesus is Lord and has asked Jesus to save them as they will now life their life following Christ Jesus as Lord.
.
These scriptures tie in with the fact that tomorrow is promised to no one and a person who does not believe will be condemned/damned , this is in reference that a person who rejects Jesus will not enter the kingdom–as long as they remain an unbeliever if they die while they remain a unbeliever they will suffer eternal separtation from God which is eternal damnation. If the person at some point in time as long as they are alive and realize Jesus is truly the savoir of mankind and they ask God for forgiveness/repent and accept the gift of salvation they will be saved. The next step is to be baptized. Water baptism is a different matter than the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
When a person has accepted Christ as savoir in their heart the Holy Spirit will enter into the person At that time and reside in them and now they become a temple of the Holy Spirit -they are Saved – but that does not necessarily mean that at that time they have been baptized in the Holy Spirit – it could happen but mostly it happens at a later time time and is a separate matter than a water baptism
.
1 Corinthians 6 19 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 20 you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.
.
 Ephesians 1  7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace 13 And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
.
1 John 4:
13 This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world
15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.
.
1 John 5  Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.
This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
6 This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify: 8 the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.
10 Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
.
Even though there are many more scriptures that tell us that a Beliver is someone who believes that Jesus is the Son of God and whoever believes that Jesus died for us and rose to life for us to give us eternal life if we believe in Jesus as savoir we Are Saved these verses should be enough to show Believers Are savedHello Luke,
 I just wanted to share with you, what we believe about salvation here at Endtime Ministries. Please see the link below.
https://www.endtime.com/what-do-you-mean-born-again/
Thank you and have a blessed day!Hello Luke, I have posted a link that explains what we believe here at Endtime Ministries.:https://www.endtime.com/what-do-you-mean-born-again/No one knows ‘the day’ (yet) since the ‘firm covenant’ mentioned in Daniel hasn’t been made yet and know one knows when that will be. The clock can be started once that’s in place.We need to be aware of the signs which will precede the rapture or we’ll carry on oblivious and make some disastrous choices through ignorance and unpreparedness.Well said Kev. I’ve read all your posts and you and Doug are the only ones making any sense on this topic and you are scripturaly correct about the Rapture being post-trib.
I’m looking forward to reading anything else you have to say.
Have a blessed day.Doug             I agree 100% with the Word of God ,, I have shown that just because a person does not do a water baptism it will Not keep them from entering the Kingdom.
            Water baptism is a matter of obedience , it is Not a determining factor of whether or not a person is part of the family of God.
            –
            . If you have sons or daughters and they are disobedient and if you are a truly loving father you will not cast them out of the family, you will still love them unconditionally .
            –
            . Some people may think that baptism is not something they have to do because they will still be accepted into the kingdom if they do not do it , but upon a truly dedicated life unto Jesus they will undertsand it is something they should do because they love Jesus and want to please Him as Jesus said it is something we should do
            When some people get saved they want to tell everyone they see about it and are on fire for Jesus; some people don’t feel any different and wonder if they are saved as the experience may be different . some people may get baptized and not change their lifestyle because no one really taught that true repentance means to change the way think/believe the direction in their life.

            Clearly the WORD says that if you do not BELIEVE you are condemned it does not say if you don’t get baptizedClearly Mark 16:16 does say that you must be baptized.”He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.” I have shown scripture to you as well, Sam you can not just take John 3:16 and say that is all you need, when Jesus says to be born again is of water and spirit in 10 verses ahead of John 3:16. The word has shown types and shadows of Blood, Water and Spirit since the tabernacle. The bible says it is shadows of the good things to come. Meaning Jesus’ death, burial and resurrection and the plan of salvation given to Peter on the day of Pentecost. Repentance, baptism in Jesus name and the infilling of the Holy Ghost. Blood, water and spirit. It is all there. Sure belief is part of it. Jesus said “believes and is baptized.” The Gospel of Jesus Christ 1 Corinthians15:1-4.All i have to say is that all of us need to be ready for the coming, no matter how it happens. we need to study so that god unlocks the meaning for us. we cant believe what we want or what makes us feel good. the important part is we need to be ready, and the only way is with gods word through Jesus Christ.I can agree on some points and disagree on others , FIRST we need to have some perspective .
The Book of the Revelation of Jesus The Christ is the full title name of the book.

John was given a vision from Jesus about what to expect about the things that ‘are yet to come’ just immediately prior to His return to earth. All through Jesus ministry on earth Jesus was trying to reveal to mankind what the spiritual realm was like and what Heaven, HIS  home is like and since mankind has never been to heaven and back to earth nor experienced or seen what the spiritual realm is like ,.
Jesus used parables , analogies as comparisons to explain these things in terms that mankind can understand. This is why there are soooo many analogies that compare to those things that the Jewish people lived every day of life. Such as The Grapes of wrath, the threshing floor, harvest time, the 4 corners ,wine-press, first fruits, putting new wine into old wine-skins, as these are a direct reference to the daily lives of the people of Israel in their ways of horticulture of planting seeds, reap what you sow, and the like of scriptures that speak of how planting seeds of the kingdom some grow and some don’t. The comparisons of the Jewish wedding is just as valid as any of these.Luke 12 35 “Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, 36 like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. 37 It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. 38 It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak.

If you have a garden or know someone who does you will know that all fruits and veggies do not ripen at the same time , so if you raise tomatoes you will harvest the ones that are ripe while seeing that there are more growing that are still all green and hard as they are not yet ripe so you will do another round of of harvesting to gather those that ripened after the first harvesting time.

As Jesus is revealing top John in the vision given by Jesus , Jesus is telling John what things will be going on in the world just immediately prior to his return. Part of this revealing prophecy is making the comparison of specific churches who are examples of what to do and what not to be doing , how people who profess to be followers of God Almighty; and some are doing as Jesus said to be doing ; and some doing doing what Jesus said Not to be doing.
Jesus used the 7 churches to show that immediately prior to the time that He returns there will people who profess to follow Christ involved in things that are unacceptable to Christ and will not be allowed in through the door that He opens , unless they repent of their deeds before he returns. Jesus also there will be followers of Christ who are doing exactly as they should be doing as told by Jesus and these people are considered the as those who have not denied Jesus and have kept the command to endure the trials of life and have not fallen into temptations of the sins of this world.
–
Jesus is using the 7 churches in the book of revelation as a means to compare what the state of condition of the churches in the time of His return will be like ,, just like those 7 churches , it is an analogy/parable to tell us that there will be those who profess to follow God but deny the name of Jesus Thee Messiah.
While we cannot know all those in this category we do know that there are still Jews that deny Jesus , as well as other large religious organizations that teach from the Holy Bible but yet deny Jesus as God Almighty , they reject the trinity and profess to follow God and yet deny Jesus .
–
Jesus is telling us that only the people who have not denied Him is who He will “keep Out From” the great tribulation time period . The Greek word “dia” is simply nowhere in the text as the true meaning is to let those who follow Jesus that He will remove us out from that great tribulation time period . The notion that suggests that true followers of Jesus will go through the Great trib is in alignment of those who believe that people have to earn their way into heaven through their works . There is simply no valid reasoning nor scripture to support it.
 To give a prophecy that will not happen until 2000+ years in the future and use the reference of 7 churches in that present time makes no logical reasoning ..unless it is a direct comparison to what the future churches would be like; and just by recognizing in today’s world there are churches that are just like those 7 churches . In short Be ReadyAgain I must stipulate that I refer to that people who have accepted Jesus and be born-again and life for Jesus BEFORE as in BEFORE the great Tribulation begins will not suffer through it , while there will be people who will accept Christ as Lord  & Savoir after the harpazo happens which it is they that you find in scripture as dying as martyrs , but There is NO scripture that states that born-again belivers BEFORE that great trib begins will be in it .
–
There are many people who cannot grasp that our Loving God will give us Eternal life for no other reason than because we believed what Jesus taught about being born-again. In like manner some believer take the same opinion of the rapture . They scream a no second chance  doctrine while the scriptures scream out not only second chance but as many chances it takes before that person dies Jesus will forgive and invite that person in to the Kingdom if they repent and ask God for forgiveness.
–
The main reason that the vast majority of churches in USA do not discuss this topic at length in open church services is because of the division the people cause in the church when people speak degrading hateful speech about the brethren that believe differently than they do.
The vast majority of Christians believe the pre-trib view and when post-tribbers start espousing that pre-trib is satan’s lie , or pretibbers are the harlot teachings , or disrespectfully say that it is just a feel good teaching -it is THEY who espouse those things that get that kind of talk from satan and are going against what Jesus taught to do which is simply show love and not hate .
–
If they would stop that kind of speech it would make all churches better. There are several different denominations that feel strongly about what they believe but still they do not speak hatefully of other denominations just because they believe differently .
Mr Baxter had visited TBN and mentioned to Paul Crouch that he had hoped that he could have use of TBN facilities to further his ministry and without a moments hesitation Paul Crouch said “you got it!” offering his ministries facilities to Mr Baxter when needed , Paul Crouch did not agree with the post-trib view and found it puzzling but instantly agreed to help a post-tribber extend his ministry . IF ONLY post-tribbers and other people who do not agree with the pre-trib view could simply show love instead of disrespect it would make things much better as a family of God.
–
I Agree with you saying “You disagree. Okay. God bless you sir. Continue on in your learning and understanding and may the Lord bless and keep you, my brother.” 🙂
pass it along , if only the rest of those who agree with post trib and differing views would say the same.

We came here to look into buying the DVDs but having seen how the site team does not accept Jesus death and rising from the grave is sufficient for salvation and doesn’t recogize Mark 16:16 , John 3:18 and does not understand baptism is a matter of obedience and believing is what provides Jesus gift of etermal life we will not be suppprting this ministry as this site fails to edify anyone except those who agree with them
God Bless YouHello Lucas,
I believe you have misunderstood something. I do not know why you would say we do not accept Jesus’ death and resurrection. First of all this is the Gospel we preach. 1 Corinthians 15:1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
If you look closely Paul says this is the Gospel that saves you! The death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Paul says it is the same gospel he received. Galatians 1:11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
So Paul says he received it straight from Jesus Christ. Then in Acts 22 Paul gives an account of that day and says what was told to him. Acts 22:10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. Notice here Paul was told why wait, go and be baptized and wash away your sins calling on the Name of the Lord. So, calling on Jesus, because he had just asked, “who are you Lord?” and the Lord said I am Jesus.
So the Gospel that Paul taught is more than just belief, he believed, the Lord had just blinded him. But when he was told what else he needed to do he responded and the scripture itself says wash away your sins. So Paul still had sin on his account, even after belief. But baptism in Jesus name takes those sins off our account, because the blood of Jesus paid for those. The blood is applied at Baptism calling on the Name of Jesus. (Acts 4:12)
The bible also says 2 Thessalonians 1:7 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
So Jesus is coming back to bring judgment on them that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus! Paul just said 1 Corinthians 15, the Gospel is the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. So the question is how do we obey this? The Answer is clear, Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Repentance=death, baptism=burial(Romans 6:4) and the Holy Ghost=resurrection (Romans 8:11). God’s plan of salvation, being born again.
You mentioned Mark16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. We totally believe this, I post it as evidence that Jesus himself said baptism is part of His plan. (Believe and is Baptized).
As far as not posting opposing beliefs, this comment page belongs to Endtime Ministries. We are teaching the Gospel as defined in the Word to reach the lost. We do not believe that scripture when taken in the full context of the word, supports a “belief only” salvation. I’m sorry if that offends anyone. But wouldn’t you rather be offended and be saved, then not be shown the truth?
Lucas, I hope you will examine these scriptures and see what they are saying is truth. I’m sorry that you will not be supporting us. I pray that the Lord blesses you and your family.DougExcellent points Doug and very well stated. Have a very blessed week!Sam – in your quote about what I said after,”Regarding the thief on the cross…..” note that I said “The thief on the cross or anyone else at that time did not know about being baptized
IN JESUS NAME…” which he could not have because Jesus did not give the commandment to baptize in His name until just before He ascended into heaven, which was in Matthew 28:19. In your paragraph after that you said,”….and everyone throughout Jesus ministry knew it and so did the thief on the cross….” There is 3 places where the thief is discussed and that is Matthew 27:38, Luke 23:32-33, and Mark 15:27 – there is no scriptural record there, or anywhere else, that the thief knew anything about water baptism, nor is there any record of EVERYONE knowing about baptism at that time. Acts 19:1-7 proves that John the Baptist did not baptize in Jesus name and that Paul RE-BAPTIZED the 12 and did so in Jesus name,”And it came to pass that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples. (2)  He said unto them, Have you received the Holy Ghost since you BELIEVED? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. (3) And he said unto them, Unto what then were you baptized? And they said unto John’s baptism. (4) Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which would come after him, that is on Christ Jesus.  (5) When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.(6) And when Paul LAID HIS HANDS UPON THEM, the Holy Ghost came on them, and they SPAKE WITH TONGUES and prophesied. (7) And all the men were about 12.” Those scriptures prove that just because a person is a believer does not mean they are automatically saved, and just because a person is a believer does not mean they automatically have the Holy Ghost. Note that Paul had to make a major effort to take the 12 to water that was deep enough to immerse them in, then baptize each one in Jesus name, and then lay hands on each one to have them receive the Holy Ghost. If it wasn’t absolutely necessary to do that, Paul would not have done it. Note that Paul said in Galatians 1:12 that he was not taught by any man but was taught directly by Jesus Christ, which was after Jesus rose from the dead and appeared to him on the road in Acts 9:5. In other words, all throughout Paul’s ministry he was doing exactly what Jesus told him to do by baptizing in Jesus name and the laying on of hands to receive the Holy Ghost. 4 verses earlier in Galatians 1:8-9 Paul said,”But though we or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.(9) As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed.” Regarding your last sentence – the point Jesus is making is to get BAPTIZED in his name, and in John 3:5 the point he is making is to get baptized in His name AND get BAPTIZED with the Holy Ghost. Malachi 3:6 says,”I am the Lord, I change not.” Hebrews 13:8,”Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” Numbers 23:19 and Hebrews 6:18 also say God can not lie. Those scriptures mean that there is no reason to think or believe that Jesus will make an exception and save a person that has not been baptized in Jesus name and that has not been baptized with the Holy Ghost. Hosea 4:6,”My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, because they have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you shall be no Priest to me, seeing that you have forgotten the law of God, I will also forget your children.”
God Bless you also.Hopefully I can show you a bigger picture of what scripture teaches as a whole , That God desires that every perosn spend eternity , eternal life with Him and gives eveyone a choice to accept Jesus or reject Jesus . It is mankind that gets hung on a interpretation and overlooks the bigger picture that Jesus Knows everyones heart , He knew the heart of the thief on the cross , Jesus could have told him that because he chose the lifestyle as a criminal he would not accept him into the kingdom , but Jesus knew his heart and told him that he would be in Paradise with Jesus that very day. No religious rituals , simply welcomed him into paradise . It really is irrelevant if the thief knew about baptism of any kind as the thief acknowledges his sin and then asked Jesus to remember him , in this context it is his way he acknowledged that Jesus is the Almighty ,
.
Something to consider here is all born again saved christians look forward to that time when we spend time in the presence of Jesus , when we enter into eternal life , this gift of eternal life with Jesus that we long for is something that cannot be taken away once we are in His presence whether it be in death before He returns or when He returns. Consider that since Jesus told the thief that he would be “with Jesus in paradise that day” means the thief will spend eternal life with Jesus . If he would not Jesus would not have taken him to paradise , focal point is that thief receives eternal life just as any born again saved child of God recieves as Jesus recieved that man unto himself and saved that thief from paying the price of eternal damnation so even though he did not go through the same process as others as in getting baptized he obtained eternal life through Jesus.
.
Jesus knew the man’s heart that the man had a repentant heart , and Jesus said that the man would be in paradise(forever eternally in Jesus presence) starting that day , In many places Jesus speaks of how he knows a persons heart whether is righteous or unrighteous , There are many scriptures about being saved and when studied in the Greek, Hebraic writings it sheds a greater light on their meaning than the English version , but the English version is also clear in various scriptures on what it is to be saved , how we know we are accepted by Jesus into His hand and make no mention at all about being baptized . The Epistles of John clearly teaches that anyone that believes Jesus is Christ is in God and God is in them .
.
Ephesians 1  7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace
.
13 And you also were included in Christ when you Heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you Believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
.
In the epistles there is no mention of baptism , now men’s religious teachings will look to other books and say , Jesus said in this other book etc etc . Point being there is no scripture anywhere that states that if a person does not get baptized they are not saved. Consider all the soldiers who get shot in the war and laying dying in battle or a bomb goes off beside them and they are laying on the battlefield dying in their last breaths and their life flashes in their eyes and they realize this is it they will not survive and they call out to Jesus and confess they are sinners and ask Jesus to save their souls and ask to be forgiven and be allowed to enter into His presence . Our Jesus will say YES welcome sons come and rest in Him , anyone who would say that they would not be allowed into Jesus presence because they did not get baptized is more focused on men’s religious teaching they hear from a preacher than the teaching that God Almighty teaches.
.
A real truth that everyone should accept is  that the ONLY Person that knows who is Saved and who is not saved is the Savoir Christ Jesus and no one else .
.
As I said before I am not interested in an ongoing debate on this , baptism is something that born again believers desire to do , if someone does not it is because they do not understand why Jesus asks us to do it; but when they learn of the blessing it brings they will undoubtedly do it . You have the right and priveledge to believe however you desire and so does everyone else . I believe it would be wiser to try to reconcile in harmony with fellow believers in reaching the lost so they will come to Christ Jesus so they can spend eternity with Jesus in His kingdom
Blessings to you

I may have a question to ask but I need to think how to phrase it as it pertains to something I read on this websiteI speak of the Epistles of John 🙂Hello Luke,
 I just want to reply to your post. There has been a lot of back and forth about salvation on here lately.
It is very important, we are dealing with a persons eternity. I know that most people have been taught their whole life, belief is all it takes to be a Christian. Belief is very important, without believing a person would not repent. And a person surely wouldn’t be baptized or receive the Spirit of the Lord.
Scripture tells us so much about salvation. Mark 16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Jesus himself says “he who Believes and is Baptized shall be saved.
Please understand that Jesus was giving the “Great Commission” here as well as Matthew 28:19. In the book of John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Here Jesus tells Nicodemus about being born again of the Water & Spirit, long before he talks about belief. Some people want to twist what is being said here, but the Word speaks for itself.
In the book of Luke Jesus tells the Apostles to wait in Jerusalem until they are filled with the power of the Holy Spirit. Luke 24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.48 And ye are witnesses of these things. Look closely at what Jesus is saying “Repentance and Remission of Sin should be preached in His Name (Jesus Name). Remember Jesus told Peter something important in Matthew 16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. So Peter had the “Keys to the Kingdom” keys open up doors. (“You must be born again to enter the KINGDOM of GOD. John3:5) Now on the day the Apostles stood up in Jerusalem, filled with the power of the Holy Spirit. Peter, the one with the Keys to the Kingdom told everyone standing there, the gospel of Jesus Christ, which scripture plainly tells us in (1Corinthians 15:1-4 is the Death, Burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ). After Peter tells them, the people are cut to the heart and say “What must we Do?” Peter uses the Keys and remember he is filled with the Holy Spirit, so the Lord was telling him what to say (Matthew 10:20) Peter says Acts 2:38 Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. This is exactly what Jesus said to preach in Luke 24:47 Repentance and remission of sins in Jesus Name.So you see Luke, this is not something that we made up. This is the plan of Salvation. Being born again. Peter could not have made it up himself, they Holy Spirit was telling him what to say. And notice it wasn’t just for the people standing there, but scripture says it is for as many as the Lord shall call. That is the plan for us all, from that day until Jesus returns. Some would say that baptism is a work, but scripture plainly tells us it is to take away your sins. It is not a work. Titus 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.Bottom line is we are trying to reach the lost with the Gospel of Jesus Christ scripture is pretty clear on how to be born again. May the Lord bless and keep you.Hello Doug,
I agree with what you say , but there are somethings that that should be acknowledged , There are many people who get pulled into another religion simply because they want to find a body of people who agree on their teachings without all the fuss and debating as they do not really know what the bible teaches and want to follow people who are in agreement ,,so they end up being pulled into a false reilgion even though they do not realize  that they have been pulled into a false religion and what is taught will lead lead into hades simply because they wanted to be a part of a religion that is in agreement without all the disagreements amongst the believers
Which is good reason why we need to be extremely careful and willing to accept Every word of scripture , and be willing to be 100% sure that we do not push aside some scriptures and focus on other scripture because of a preferred interpretation .
Only the saved believers will partake of the bema seat of Christ and will be facing Jesus to account for what we did, how we lived, what we taught and that will be a big part of what crowns/rewards are received . If we compare the 10 commandments – if a person fails one, it is said that is the same as if they failed all.
It should be noted what is meant by the term ‘he who has believed’ is someone who has repented and asked Jesus to be their personal Lord & Savoir ….then there is a different context as in saying they believe that Jesus lived , they believe that Jesus was a good man and a prophet , they believe that Abe Lincoln was President of the USA , which is like saying they acknowledge who they are but did not personally know them , they knew of them , not have a relationship with them , so it is really dependent on context when using the term believe .
To say that just to believe is not good enough is a false narrative and should be avoided , rather it should be a person asks for more detail such as ” you say you believe in Jesus please tell me excatly what it is that you believe. ”  This way the person will tell you what they believe and you may learn they believe the same as you do .  I see that you responded to someone and it seems you didn’t get what they meant , but what caught my attention was when you said ” I’m sorry if that offends anyone. But wouldn’t you rather be offended and be saved, then not be shown the truth?” That really comes across as you believe that only you have the truth and if someone does not agree with you then they do not have truth , I would hope you could see that kind of presumptive statement would likely drive a wedge and cause division much more so than any help you would hope it could achieve
The compared standard is clear that if you choose to say that a person who receives Christ as savoir and does not get baptized they will not receive eternal life it is Extremely important that you show scripture that declares that if a person does not get baptized they will not be allowed into eternal life , since there is no such scripture and there is proof that it is not true with Jesus accepting the thief on the cross into eternal life
.
You can post every scripture in the bible , but if you choose not to recognize the scripture that shows clearly that a thief received eternal life without a baptism ceremony , the theory that a person must have baptism to receive eternal life fails .
It is a fear factor that supports the idea , it be time to let Jesus be the Almighty it is Only Jesus who will decide , the fear factor is that those who push this idea is that there will be a lot of people who will abandon the practice of baptism but it has not happened and won’t happen   and it is time to let go of the fear as it only causes division in the body of believers , Jesus commands us to be baptized but he Never said that if you don’t he will disown , abandon or not allow eternal life to those who have given their life to Jesus but did not go through a symbolic ceremony that is only to show the public that they have given their life to Jesus
If you would like more detail on this check out these links I came across  they offer a lot more info on this matter .

By the same standards we need to examine that when a person is shown to have been accepted into the presence of Jesus for eternity that was not baptized; It alone is evidence that it is permissible to enter in to eternal life without the symbolic ceremony of baptism .
Now we need to address the times that people are at deaths door whether it be by car accident, a plane going down to crash resulting in death , illness, etc that they know they will not survive they know they will die and receive Jesus as Lord and savoir minutes or hours before they die ..
.
Think about how many people find themself in that very circumstance over the course of 2000 years; while we can’t know the exact number it is a gigantic number and then there are those yet to come into that type of circumstance and it simply  inconceievable to think that Jesus would say ..sorry but you don’t have enough time to live to find someone to baptize you as you will only live another 20 minutes , so even though you ask for forgiveness you must be baptized to be given eternal life  …. John 3:16  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
 if you set the standard that it is an absolute requirment to be baptized to recieve eternal life , you must provide scripture that clearly states it as such in the same standard  as you proclaim it , and you know it does not exist ..and how can you say that people in these situations that they know they will die in minutes or hours will not be granted eternal life ?
.
To say  Jesus said to be baptised and that if a person is not he will not be given eternal life  is not what Jesus said and no where is that said in all of scripture.
.
I am trying to say this in the nicest possible manner , but to ignore scripture or sweep it  under the rug if it does not follow someones teaching  is not what Jesus would find acceptable , so I bring these things to your attention to hopefully help you see that whatever is taught must fit every conceivable scenario that a human that was created in the image of the Almighty who at any point in time realizes that they need Jesus , need his forgiveness, who repent, acknowledge they are a sinner , Jesus is there to forgive and receive his creation into eternal life ,
I admire the goodhearted intention that you have to reach the lost , but realize that sometimes the manner of delivery of said intentions can override and defeat those good intentions
May the Lord bless and keep you. 🙂A link I meant to post as I posted one twice earlier instead of including this one .https://www.carm.org/debate-topic-water-baptism-necessary-salvation

God BlessHello again Luke,
 I would like to add, as for circumcision: Genesis 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
So God established the circumcision as His Covenant with Abraham.
Genesis 17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. (So clearly this says that if you did not have the circumcision of the flesh, you had no part in the Covenant.) So to say that all Abraham did was believe is not what this scripture seems to say. Abraham had to believe and be circumcised.
Paul said in Romans 2:28  For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
29 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
(So Paul says that we are now Circumcised in the heart and it is a spiritual circumcision. Look at what that circumcision is, Colossians 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.(Baptism is being Circumcised in Christ). The New Covenant.Hello Luke,
Let me ask this question. Did Jesus say? “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved.” Because I would say, scripture does say this. So my whole point is Jesus told the Apostles, including Peter to do what? And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
Baptism has been a part of the salvation plan since the book of Genesis. Peter explains this in 1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; 20  Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
Paul spoke of the baptism of the fathers 1 Corinthians 10:2 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
In the Tabernacle plan, water was used to wash the blood that was shed for covering the sins of the people. When Joshua took the Hebrews into the promised land they crossed the Jordan. (Joshua 3).
Baptism is so much more than a ritual or the outward sign of an inward change. I ask you what does Acts 2:38 say baptism is for? “be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,” Who does it say it is for? Every one of you! ” For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” Every one from that point on until Jesus returns. So why wouldn’t that be part of the salvation plan? Paul taught the same salvation plan as Peter did Acts 2:38. Look at Acts 19:And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.7 And all the men were about twelve.So if you look at this scripture, these 12 guys (believed) and were called disciples, but they were missing something. But they had not received the Holy Ghost, the first thing Paul did was ask about baptism, then he baptized them on the spot and they received the Holy Ghost. Doesn’t that sound like Paul taught the same thing Peter taught? He told them to believe, (so there is belief) in Jesus and to be baptized in Jesus name and then they were filled with the Holy Ghost. The fulfilment of the promise that Jesus was talking about in Mark 16 and Luke 24 and Matthew 28. So once again, we are not teaching anything different than the what Jesus told the Apostles to teach.
So we believe that Jesus Christ is the risen savior. That He is God manifest in the flesh. 1 Timothy 3:16 That He died on the cross as the sacrificial Lamb of God. That He raised on the third day, that He appeared to the disciples and many others and that He was received up into glory. We also believe He gave Peter the power and authority to stand on the day of Pentecost and declare the plan of salvation. Acts 2:38. This is the way everyone was converted in the entire bible. The acts of the Apostles are the model for the church. God showed us His plan and that is how it is done over and over. Once again I ask you what does scripture say baptism is for? The remission of sins. Remission-NOUN meaning the cancellation of a debt, charge, or penalty: “the plan allows for the partial remission of tuition fees”synonyms: cancellation · setting aside · suspension · revocation · abrogation.I pray that this will help you understand why we teach this plan of Salvation .https://www.endtime.com/how-do-i-become-a-christian/

Have a blessed day Brother.Luke – I never mean to offend anyone but please consider the following. You said,”In the epistles there is no mention of baptism….” There actually is – Paul said in Galatians 3:27,”For as many of you as have been BAPTIZED into Christ have put on Christ.” Paul also said in Romans 6:4,”Therefore we are buried with him in BAPTISM….” Paul also said in Colossians 2:12,”BURIED with him in baptism…”1 Peter 3:21,”The like figure wherein even BAPTISM DOES ALSO NOW SAVE US ….” Peter explained why in Acts 2:38 which is FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS – which is for the INITIAL remission of sins and not the confessing of sin stated later in 1 John 1:9, which is 18 chapters AFTER the book of Acts. Note that is the same John that went with Peter to Samaria in Acts 8:14-17,”Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God (BELIEVERS at that point) they sent unto them Peter and John: (15) Who when they were come down prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost, (16) For as yet he was not fallen on any of them, only they were BAPTIZED in the NAME OF THE LORD JESUS. (17) Then LAID THEY THEIR HANDS ON THEM and they received the Holy Ghost.” Note that Paul was baptized in Jesus name by Ananias in Acts 9:18, was baptized with the Holy Ghost when Ananias LAID HANDS ON HIM in Acts 22:16, he baptized others in Jesus name in Acts 16:16, Acts 16:33, Acts 18:7, Acts 18:8, Acts 19:5-6. Note that in Acts 19:1 it states Paul was at EPHESUS baptizing in Jesus name, and it was Paul that later wrote the book of Ephesians. In Acts 18:8 it states Paul baptized Crispus and many CORINTHIANS – Paul later wrote 1st and 2nd Corinthians. The scriptures above prove why there is little mention of water baptism in the epistles, which is because Paul and the other disciples had ALREADY baptized them in Jesus name and laid hands on them to receive the Holy Ghost – there was no reason for them to keep being told about water baptism, and note that those scriptures mentioned here in the beginning are in the PAST TENSE, meaning Paul is making those statements to people that HAD BEEN baptized in Jesus name and laid hands on to receive the Holy Ghost. Jesus told Peter in Matthew 16:19,”And I will give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. In Matthew 18:18 Jesus is speaking to ALL of his disciples,”Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” – which means that whatever Peter or Paul said and did regarding water baptism in Jesus name and receiving the Holy Ghost/Holy Spirit is SET IN STONE and NOT NEGOTIABLE.
Irvin Baxter has 4 excellent 1 hour DVDs on this subject in the Salvation Package which are,”Understanding the Godhead”, “True vs False Christianity”, “Born Again – Three Steps”, and “Receiving the Holy Ghost.” Those can also be purchased as a download and you can be viewing them on your computer in a few minutes, and I think they are on sale right now for half price at $4.50 each. As with all of Irvin’s DVDs – he has the scripture written out on the screen so the viewer can verify that what he is saying is true.
Blessings to you Luke.Did you not see I said the epistles of John ?
The entire chapter of Romans 10 is about being saved but yet does not mention baptism
Jesus did not speak of baptism to the important religious leader of Israel of baptism
You cannot find any scripture that states that if a person does not get baptized that it will prevent them from being allowed into the kingdom
many people are offended when people say that their loved ones did not make into the presence of Jesus when they died after they repented and received Christ but were not able to get somewhere to have a human dunk them in water , It would be a humbling experience if you actually engaged in conversation with people who experience this loss and hear teaching as  you say, try seeking out those people and engaged with themLuke, Romans chapter 6 is about being saved and it talks about baptism. And Romans 8 is talking about being saved and Paul speaks on the Holy Spirit. It also says if you do not have the Spirit of Christ you are none of His. And when Paul wrote this letter, he was writing it to a church that had been already established.
You say that no scripture says that if you are not baptized you will not be allowed into the Kingdom of God? John 3:3Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
You said before no scripture says baptism saves you and yet you posted Mark 16:16 “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.”
Luke 24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
This is exactly what Peter did in Acts 2:38 “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” The 2 things Jesus said to do in Jerusalem, is exactly what Peter preached. Repentance and remission of sin. (Baptism in Jesus Name Remits our sins). Luke I ask you honestly, what does this scripture say baptism is for?
Please show me your scripture that says baptism is a outward sign of an inward change.
The Bible says 1 John 5:6 “This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.See Nicodemus couldn’t understand the earthly things; Spirit, water and blood. That is what Jesus was trying to explain to Nicodemus. He should have understood this because it was rooted into everything Nicodemus, taught. The Exodus, put the blood on the door, crossing the Red Sea and being led by the Cloud and pillar of smoke. Blood, Spirit and Water. The Tabernacle/Temple plan, Bronze Altar(Blood) Bronze Laver (Water) and the Holy of Holies(Spirit). Same thing Peter preached: Blood/death/repentance, Water/burial/baptism and Spirit/Resurrection/Holy Spirit.
Jesus said the Spirit, Water and Blood agree in one. One what? One plan of salvation. Ephesians 4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you allGod Bless you Brother…Luke – I did see that you also said the epistles of John. Although it isn’t really important in this conversation, John isn’t an epistle – 1st, 2nd, and 3rd John is but the John after Matthew, Mark, and Luke isn’t. I also know you’ve said John 3:16 a number of times and is one of the most referenced scriptures in the New Testament, which is true – BUT JESUS WASN’T FINISHED SPEAKING YET. Just before he ascended into heaven he gave the COMMANDMENT to be baptized in Matthew 28:19. Jesus said in John 14:15,”If you love me, keep my COMMANDMENTS”. In Mark 16:16 he said,”He that believes AND IS BAPTIZED shall be SAVED but he that believes not shall be damned.” Jesus explained what damned means in Matthew 13:49-50,”So it shall be at the end of the world, the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from the just, (50) And shall cast them into the furnace of fire, there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”  He also said in Mark 9:43-44,”And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off, it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched. (44) Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.” Without exception, every time that his disciples baptized was in Jesus name, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is Acts 2:38, Acts 8:14-18, Acts 9:18, Acts 10:47-48, Acts 16:15, Acts 16:33, Acts 18:7-8, Acts 19:3-5, and Acts 22:16. They were doing exactly what Jesus said to do in Matthew 28:19, which is to baptize in the name OF the Father, and OF the Son, and OF the Holy Ghost. Father is a title and not a name, Son is a title and not a name, Holy is an adjective, and Ghost is a noun. All those scriptures mentioned above in the book of Acts proves we get the Father in the name Jesus, the Son in the name Jesus, and the Holy Ghost/Holy Spirit in the name Jesus. Jesus disciples never said any combination of the words Father, Son, or Holy Ghost when they baptized, or ever used that combination of words in one sentence regarding any other topic.
Jesus said in John 10:27,”My sheep hear my voice and I know them, and they follow me.”
Continued Blessings to you Luke and have a good day.As I have just joined this platform to share my faith, I wish to say Thank you to this Ministry for giving us the opportunity to share.
With reference to the question “does it matter whether you believe Pre-Trib., Mid. Or Post Tribulation?  I believe it does matter as knowing When the Rapture occurs will enable believers to wake up spiritually and prioritise, above all, his/her relationship with God.  Secondly, Not all born-again Christian will be caught up to meet the LORD in the air, only those whose lamps( Word in heart) are burning As they still have Oil (The Holy Spirit). Remember the Bible story of the Ten virgins. Five are wise because they are ready and five,  foolish as when the Master arrives, the oil in their lamps run out.  We pray this does not happen to us although we call ourselves Christians.  So, let’s urge ourselves to live in Obedience to His word daily, seeking the Holy Spirit to enable us, lead and teach us with all humility to abide in Him. My favourite and hope is Pre-Tribulation Rapture because His word in  (1 Thesalonians 5:9 says ” For God has not appointed us to wrath…..I believe it will happen before, but won’t know till it happens.Hello Doug,The most repeated , most famous , most well known scriptureand  most recognized scripture in the entire bible bar none is JOHN 3:16-18 ,, I would like to ask you a question but first I will share an analogy.
.
analogy – .. Say you are standing in a room and there is a counter across from you that has 5 glass bottles on it and 4 of them are clear and only one is solid red, and you ask the person standing next to the counter to pass you the red bottle , and they give you a clear bottle , you say no not that one the red bottle, and you go through this process until all clear bottles have been handed to you and you ask again for the red bottle and yet still the person does not hand you the red bottle. Every normal person will wonder why did the person not pass you the red bottle . The attention turns to what is the reason they refuse to acknowledge the red bottle ?.
.
What we have right now is your refusal to acknowledge that there are many many people who have been given eternal life without being baptised . Scripture evidence is given to you multiple times in multiple ways but yet you refuse it is there , it is baffling to say the least .
.
In John 3 Jesus is speaking with the religious leader of Israel baffled that Nicodemus does not understand what Jesus is talking about John 3:10 – Jesus answered and said to him, “You are  Israels teacher, and you do not know these things?
.
Jesus is shocked in astonishment that Nicodemus does not understand what Jesus is talking about , he is wondering how is this possible?  that the religious leader does not know nor understand this , which itself proves that the idea that they can not know of this  because Jesus had not yet died is simply a lack of understanding of those who say that .
John 3
 15 that WHOEVER BELIEVES in Him should not perish but have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that WHOEVER BELIEVES in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him 18  WHOEVER BELIEVES in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.
.
Nicodemus was the religious leader/teacher of Israel of that time and in the ENTIRE conversation Jesus did not even mention baptism at all in the entire conversation with Nicodemus , since  Nicodemus was an important religious teacher of Israel and being a teacher of the Holy scriptures; IF baptism was an absolute requirment to obtain eternal life Jesus would most certainly have made it abundantly clear that a person must be baptised in order to receive eternal life as this would be the make or break crucial point that you make it out to be , but yet Jesus Himself the Creator of everyone and everything did not even mention baptism in the entire conversation with an important teacher of the Holy scriptures to Israel !!
but us mere humans will make sure that in any real dangerous area will make sure that people are warned of danger that can kill or harm as in don’t touch a live electrical power line etc.
.
As it is continually brought to your attention of matters such as people in their last moments of life accepting Jesus as savoir , the thief on the cross who did not get baptizd being given eternal life , and all those in the OT that were given eternal life that were  not baptized .
So here we are continually asking you to address these matters of the thief on the cross given eternal life , the matters of people who are at deaths door and knowing they are going to die in a matter of minutes or couple hours and comply with :
John 3:18 WHOEVER BELIEVES in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son
.
Notice in Romans 10 the ENTIRE chapter is about being saved , starts out with a prayer to save Israel and the within the ENTIRE chapter baptism is NOT mentioned at all , not even once!
.
Romans 10:1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
.
10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
.
The entire chapter of Romans 10 does not even hint at baptism!
Since you seem to refuse to address the matter of people who are at deaths door who comply with all these scriptures calling on the Lord, acknlowledge their sins , acknowledge they need Jesus salvation and plead on Jesus to save them and follow every possible thing that they can say to ask God for forgiveness and save thier soul and allow them to enter Jesus presence without the opportunity to partake in a public ceremony of baptism , the only option you leave is to say they are eternally damned
.
Are you afraid to publicly state for the record to tell the public that your belief system teaches that people in those death door circumstances with be eternally damned for no other reason than they did not partake in a public baptism ?
.
I search for the way to bring to your attention that if peoples eternity is so important to you then why do you refuse to answer this matter , lest leaving what you will not address nor acknowledge to speak thousands of times louder than all you have said collectively .
.
How much clearer can it be said ? you  express that there is no other choice , if anyone who has not yet accepted Jesus into their heart can be driving down the road on any given day and unexpectedly find a bus has crossed the yellow line on the road and collided with thier car and now they are near death in just a few minutes and they call out to Jesus to save them , in your teaching they are simply wasting their time and Jesus will not allow them into His presence because they don’t have time to get a public baptism
Have a blessed day Brother DougWater baptism is part of salvation (I Peter 3:21). It is an expression of faith in God by obedience to His Word
(Mark 16:16; Acts 2:41). The scriptural mode of baptism is immersion in water, and only this method retains the
biblical symbolism of baptism as a burial (Matthew 3:16; Acts 8:36-39; Romans 6:4). Faith in Christ and repentance
from sin are necessary to its validity; thus infant baptism is not proper (Matthew 3:8; Acts 2:38; 8:37).
Baptism is more than a symbolic ceremony and more than a public declaration of joining the church. The Ethiopian
eunuch was baptized in the desert with no observer present. Baptism was so urgent for the Philippian jailer
that he received it at midnight, as soon as he heard the gospel message.The biblical significance of water baptism is as follows:
1. God remits sins at water baptism (Acts 2:38;22:16). God erases the record of sin and cancels the penalty
for sin. He washes away sins; He buries them forever.2. Baptism is part of the new birth (John 3:5; Titus
3:5).3. Baptism identifies us with the burial of Jesus(Romans 6:4; Colossians 2:12). It indicates we died to sin
by repentance and are burying our past sins, the dominion of sin, and the sinful lifestyle.4. Water baptism is part of the one baptism of
water and Spirit that places us into Christ (Romans 6:3-4; Galatians 3:27; Ephesians 4:5). It is a personal identification with Jesus and part of entrance into His
family.5. Baptism is part of our spiritual circumcision(Colossians 2:11-13). By the new birth we enter into the new covenant relationship with God.
The Bible teaches that baptism should be administered in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38). This includes actually invoking the name of Jesus orally (Acts
22:16; James 2:7) and re-baptizing those who have been baptized some other way (Acts 19:1-5). Using the name of Jesus in the baptismal formula expresses faith in the:
* person of Christ (who He really is)* work of Christ (death, burial, and resurrection for our salvation)* power and authority of Christ (ability to save us by Himself)
Thank you Luke. God bless you as wellWhile visiting this site I decided to check this forum out and would be interested in why Doug seems to believe that if a person finds themself in a situation such as drunk driver crashes into them and they are dying with only 30 minutes left to live and they are faced with death and eternity and they cry out to Jesus with a repentant heart confessing their sins and asking Jesus to forgive their sins and won’t live to get baptized ; Doug believes this person would not be permitted to go to be in Jesus presence
Doug if you would answer this directly   I would like to know why you think such …..please I have read your posts but you seem unwilling to speak directly to this matter without the dance around it but not addressing it
ThanksHello Lynn, thank you for your question. Let me start off by saying, this is a hypothetical question. I try to show people what the scripture says we need to do while we are alive. And scripture say that we need to “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”  That is scripture, not my opinion. Now to answer your hypothetical question. I am not the one who makes the decision of someone on their death bed making a plea to the Lord. I understand why people ask, but the answer is, I don’t make that call. Another question everyone wants to know about the thief on the cross. Jesus had not died for our sins yet or risen from the grave or poured out His Holy Spirit. So the Thief was under a completely different dispensation. The Law. Please Lynn, do not think I am judging, all I am doing is showing people what scripture says. I know it isn’t what most people have been taught their whole life. I never said that belief isn’t a factor, the bible says,”But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” Hebrews 11:6
Everyone on the day of Pentecost believed as Peter told them about Jesus, and then they said what must we do? Peter told them what to do. Acts 2:38, this was the first day of church.I must add that dispensationalism does not change from Gods eternal plan
God knew that man could not fulfill the Law
Its purpose was ro show man Needs a savoir and Jesus is the Only One who could complete the Law
God is the same yesterday today and for eternity
Jesus was in the beginning until the end
How people choose to interpret Gods Word will not change the Orignal purpose which is to provide a parh to eternity with the CreatorWhat up Doug ?

Have a blessed day Brother Doug
Why you not post what I say ?
you post other peoples postI have posted and replied to your post. Have a blessed day.Doug
I appreciate your response but you surely know that all you can do is express what you believe
You have a view on how you believe just because people do not agree does mean you are correct
Large numbers of people die everyday and many suddenly they have minutes to choose their eternal destiny
As you say you do not decide but yet you insist that what you teach does decide …you dance around it simply to try to make your interpretation valid
Like Jesus said “Who do you say that I AM:” It will always in all cases be Jesus who decides never you or any person
Something you should think about is if there is even just one person who perishes because they followed what you insist
You will be required to answer for it simply because you support it
Sadly people do not give enough thought about how the Kingdom will be
Praying for you that you look into this more deeplyThank you Lynn, that is exactly why I don’t respond to hypothetical questions and I give scriptures. I appreciate your concern. But I will ask you one thing. If I obey Acts 2:38 how am I wrong exactly? I have followed the bible as was instructed to everyone. You do see that, right? “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.Notice this scripture says, this is for “all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” So if this is for everyone, how am I wrong for obeying the word of the Lord? You say, I am the one insisting this, the “Word of God” says it. I didn’t make up Acts 2:38. This was the first church sermon and this was Peter’s altar call. Not Doug’s. So at the end of the day we are all supposed to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. And if like so many say, all you need to do is believe on Jesus. I have all my bases covered. Not only do I believe, but I have repented and been baptized in the Name of Jesus for the remission of my sins and I have received the promise of the Holy Ghost! I hope you can see what I’m saying. I am not condemning anyone, only sharing the same message the Apostles shared. The Gospel, the death, burial and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.Seems you have lost sight of what is asked of you , it is all agreed that everyone should be baptized.
The scriptures you give simply in no way at all address the people who have acknowledged their sins , repented of their sins , proclaimed that Jesus paid the price of their sins and asked Jesus into their hear to be Lord and savoir and have not yet been baptized , Jesus spoke to the people who had not repented of their sins , the scripture you use do not prove anything about Jesus saying that repentant sinners who have asked Jesus for fogiveness of sins because he was not speaking to people who have already repented
you simply cannot prove that God says if you don’t get baptized you are not allowed into eternal life with Jesus
your view that a person is not allowed into heaven if they are not baptized is on the same level as those who insist that Jehovah created Jesus and that Jesus is not the Almighty , they say Jesus is Michael the Archangel. Your interpretation is just that your interpretation, you need a scripture that states outright that God says that repenting of your sins and asking Jesus to forgive and be your lord and savoir is not good enough to be received into eternal life–simply put you don’t have that
God Bless you DougThank you Luke, I pray you keep searching, God bless and keep you.DougI have an easy way to see this
Really simple that has not yet been mentioned by anyone  it makes it easy to understand it is not a mystery for Jesus has answered this alreadyQuite good for Evangelical teaching, Mr Baxter. I also place the same emphasis on the “not for certain timing” on the Rapture. However I DO lean to Pre-Trib and I’ll tell you why: Anything once the Tribulation begins, well then we will know when the thief is coming. Secondly, Rev 3:10 “Because ye have kept the word of my truth, I will also keep thee FROM THE HOUR OF TEMPTATION which will come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth.” Third, 1 Thess also says that “He who restrains will restrain until He is taken out of the way; AND THEN the Man of Sin will be unveiled/revealed.” He that restrains is the Holy Spirit who DWELLS in Spirit-filled believers’ temples – their bodies. I also believe that to be raptured we will HAVE to be living HOLY LIVES. The Psalms say, “Who is he that can reach the Courts of the LORD? He that dwelleth with clean hands, etc” who lives by Grace and the Holy Spirit, a holy life. 1 Peter: “Be ye holy for I am holy.” Just before the Flood, which after all, Our Lord compares with the Last Days, “God looked down from heaven to see if there were any who did right and behold there were none.” (Psalm 12) But then Genesis says, “BUT NOAH found grace/respect in the eyes of the LORD.” Conclusion: Just as the survivors of the Flood were very few, “that is 8 souls” (St Paul), even so those that will be raptured MUST be living holy lives and therefore must have reached, by grace, the level of a “holy person” either penitent like myself, or innocent like someone who all their life led a pure and holy life. That’s few people. The babyboomers who were bohemian like me – we in many cases have to “wash our baptismal gown again in the “Precious Blood of the Lamb,” and in the early Church of the Fathers, that meant ‘leave the lifestyle of those all caught up in compromise with the world, put their wealth up for the Poor or the Lord’s good works in His Church, take up their Cross daily, and go into the desert and seek holy tears of penance,’ living like monks, nuns or recluses/hermits so they can’t get into trouble. It means living a life of penance and consecrating up our lives to the Sacred Heart of Jesus through the Immaculate Heart of Mary Our Blessed Mother, and cry lamentation over their past life – detesting their former sins – and with FIRM resolve to never live again for lust, avarice,  hate and anger, strife, back-biting, accusers, envy, tolerating great sins in your self and others; And who put on Christ to live the NEW LIFE – that is washing your baptismal wedding gown, because in the traditional wedding of the Hebrew people which is what Jesus compares His Second Coming to, the wedding banquet and marriage take place after He swiftly scoops up his bride from her father’s house and takes her to His Father’s House – and all this before then He takes on His social role: that is – the King then puts on His armor after the banquet (which ceremonies take 7 years!) and gather’s His soldiers/knights the Saints, and then goes in JUDGEMENT in the great wrath of God to rule the nations with a Rod of Iron. (See Arnold Fruchtenbaum, Hebrew Messianic, for the whole story of the Jewish wedding which explains the Apocalypse). SO that is why I think its VERY PROBABLE that the Rapture takes place before the Tribulation.DougEvery scripture offer those who are being spoken to are unrepentant sinners being told that they need to repent ask Jesus for forgives of their sins and then after they have done so to be baptized
.
People who have already repented and ask for forgiveness of sins recieve forgiveness immediately when they ask ….if a person waits for 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 months before they get baptized were forgiven of sins when they ask for it ..God does not wait until the person goes through a symbolic ritual before he forgives the person who asks for forgiveness
.
You have heard the phrase “just going through the motions” The act of baptism accomplishes nothing unless the person truly comprehends why they are doing it otherwise it is just going through the motions
Even Irvin calls it symbolic as that is what it is
Getting wet does not forgive sins
Repenting and acknowledging that only Jesus can forgive sins and asking to be forgiven is accepting Jesus gift of salvation
Baptism shows a public proclaimation you belong to Jesus …
Think about it baptism 100% of the time is performed in the sight of more and typically many people…….
Think about it every time a TV or radio program offers the prayer for people to come to Christ they ask people who partook in praying with the host of the show to call in and share their conversion ….it is a proclamation to another fellow believer …it is not meant to replace baptism just another way to speak about the choice made in the heart to fellow believers …….Hey Lucas,
Thank you for your comment. You are correct, that at repentance Jesus forgives you. However,at repentance, God destroys sin’s present dominion in a person’s life, and He removes the barrier preventing a personal relationship with Him. Atwater baptism, God removes the legal record of sin and erases the penalty for that sin, namely death. God deals with the present consequences of sin at repentance and with the future consequences of sin at water baptism. Both are necessary for forgiveness. Thus Peter said, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins” (Acts 2:38). (The
New International Version is more emphatic: “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus
Christ so that your sins may be forgiven.”) Then a person needs to be filled with the Holy Spirit so that he can resist the temptation of sin and have the resurrection power of Christ Jesus. This is all part of God’s plan. Thanks Lucas and have a blessed day.Hello Doug,
To say a person needs to be filled with the Holy Spirit so that he can resist the temptation of sin and have the resurrection power of Christ Jesus. This is all part of God’s plan is correct but obviously not as easy as it sounds as there are thousands of preachers in the pulpit who commit vile sins publicly as well as in private , they will stand in the pulpit and preach to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and even be the person performing the baptismal service while yet being involved in sexual relations with married people and fornication , some with prostitutes and some with homosexual partners while even being lifted up a high profile preachers espousing to repent and be baptized.
I seen this discussion and hope to help you see there is more to this than what you see or others have shown. All of the scriptures you provide focus on people of the bible telling people to repent and be baptized , this is correct we should be baptized we need to heed to the call to be baptized. But also recognizing there is no scripture that states of any consequence if a person repents asks Jesus to be Lord and savoir of their life asks forgiveness of sins and does not get baptized . What is not there  is also very important .To focus only on what is said to be done is not sufficient to understand why.
Mankind loves power and authority , give them a little taste of it and they want as much as they can get , think of all the past kings and rulers and pharoahs who get intoxicated on thier power and control of the people under their control , even today it is the same with many many people who have positions of power and authority , managers, supervisors , team leads , , There are those who are physically bigger than others who try to dominate those of less strentgh , bullying etc. Within this power/authority people will say things like “don’t question my authority’ “do as I say ” “yours is not to question why ,yours is to do or die” It reflects just do as I say “or else !!”
This can lead people into a mindset of – just do it – don’t think about why just do it because you were told to do so.. don’t ask why just do as you are told! Sometimes people take this manner of parenting and it results in bringing out the rebellious side of the children because the children don’t understand the why as the parent will only focus on ..,., do as you are told !
The first words of the book of Genesis “In the beginning God” He is where everything begins and ends .When Moses encounted God “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.”
‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”
14 God said to Moses, “I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I am has sent me to you.’”
Exodus 6:1-8
Passover and the parting of the Red Sea is  God doing as He said he would to fulfill what he has promised
1 Corinthians 12:27  Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it
2 Corinthians 5:17  – Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
1 John 31-3
1 Peter 2:9  – But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
1 Jude 5 Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord[c] at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe
Galatians 2:20  – I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
John 15: 5 “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.
7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will[b] ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples.
.
16 You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you. 17 These things I command you, that you love one another
.
All of the scriptures that speak about Jesus is the Bridegroom and the believers are the Bride of Christ
From the beginning of Gods word all through till the end of the bible it is God Almighty  declaring his love and devotion for us , repeatedly again and again proclaiming his commitment to us and if we are commited unto him he will not only give us eternal life but a life experience that is in the glory of God in such a way that no man can conceive the measure of abundance he will provide . Even to the book of the revelation of Christ Jesus the message of being connected to and identified in Christ Jesus is taught.
The purpose of the mark 666 is to separate people in who they serve their life to , if a person accepts the mark 666 they  have publicly acknowledged that they are serving the man on earth who has called himself god , Scripture states that if a person accepts the mark 666 they have forfeited the chance to spend eternity with Jesus , it also serves to show who will reject the mark to serve and commit to serving Jesus
I could make this list much longer but the point I am making in trying to amplify what you partly understand and partly do not understand about baptism.
Baptism is a publicly demonstrated symbolic representation of our connection to Jesus death and raising from the grave to eternal life. A spiritual renewing commitment to the ONE who gives and created all life and the washing of sins but more importantly the commitment unto Jesus and living this life unto Jesus in direct connection in our outward proclaimation of our love and devotion unto Jesus in direct connection to the devotion he gave us unto death that we give Jesus our devotion unto him unto our own death .
So if we are confronted by such as ISIS or anyone who hates Jesus and will kill anyone who follows Jesus that we will not deny him and follow him unto death even if we face the theat of being beheaded for our faith. The reason it is commanded that we be baptized is for us to publicly proclaim our love and devotion for Jesus in a like manner that he did for us .
John 12 This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 13 Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.
Scripture tells us that the love of many will wax cold , it happens in the church as well, as there are many people who go through the motions of repenatnce and baptism; and even though they may have turned away from many sins in their life their pride and arrogance ,  selfrighteousness causes division among the brethern .Many people get baptized as just part of the process and have no real understanding of what it means and just go on with life without much difference in how they think or interact with people . Some believers make a true permanent change in their life and for others it be like a new toy that the newness has worn off .
There are some people who will go door to door asking people “have you heard of the new prophet of God’ or those who insist that there will be only 144000 in the kingdom with Jesus , and that Almighty God created Jesus , while we can spend from here to eternity showing scripture evidence that what they say is not supported by scripture it will not matter as they only believe what they do and are not interested in learning from anyone who does not believe as they do.
There are some people who still try the fire and damnation preaching– if they ask if you believe on Christ , if you say no then the ‘you will burn in hell’ tactic comes on only driving the intended person to be witnessed to, to run away as fast as possible . Jesus said you will know his followers by their fruit , how they behave , how they live , how well they  represent a Loving God who died and  rose to life everlasting to give everlasting life lives their existing life for Him who gave it .
.
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
John 3:15 that WHOEVER BELIEVES in Him should not perish but have eternal life.
A person who gets baptized having a full complete understanding of why they get baptized has done nothing more accomplishing than someone who does not understand and gets baptized if both proclaim that it is soley Jesus that saves  and the Grace that saves us. Thusly to proclaim that a person who has repented of their sins , asked Jesus to cover them with His blood , Jesus saving grace ,and have joined the body of born again believers , go out to the world proclaiming it is Jesus saving grace that not only changed their own life but can change anyones life if they commit their life to Christ . You putting so much power in the water you take it away from the words of the Creator. It is to say that when a person has complied with every thing Jesus asks as in repent of sins , ask forgiveness , acknoledge what Jesus accomplished through the cross and has not yet gotten wet in the water , in your idea of a hypothetical question only reveals that you prefer to believe that there has never been anyone who has accepted Christ and repented of their sins and died before they could get baptized,even thoughit has truly happened millions of times already and you prefer to believe that the possibility of this being a real case is so far from a reality that it does not warrant a response from you reveals you need a ‘safe zone’ where you feel protected from answering the question that is very real as you feel backed into a corner and so instead of answering you feel ‘safe’ calling it hypothetical. It is called you being in denial of something you know the answer is not something you are willing to say and nearly everyone if not everyone can se that.
If they do not live their life in a manner that exhibits that they are commited to living and loving people the way Jesus did . If a person gets baptized and does not understand the true deeper significance of what it accomplishes it is the same as someone who does not understand and does not get baptized , In a similar manner people take the approach in marriage where they say they want to spend their life with a certain person , but thinking in their heart if it does not work out well they can always get a divorce so they are not truly committed to their partner. Baptism is about commitment and living up to that commitment and telling the world about that commitment likened unto Jesus telling the world of his commitment to those who commit themselves unto him.
The act of baptism has no power in it , it does not determine if a person is saved or not as that is only determined by accepting Jesus blood on the cross and repenting and asking Jesus love and forgiveness . There is that saying to be careful of the battles you pick as you can cause people to run away when you want them to run toward you . Like those who preach a burn in hell tactic to unbelivers and even fellow believers will just want to avoid such people , some people take the approach that fire and brimstone is telling them the truth , or you are not saved unless you have been dunked in water which causes people to say ..here comes ‘that guy’ let’s go before he comes over here ,The wise thing is let it be as you cannot ‘win’ unless you let it be and give it to God to take it from there
Sometimes people get baptized a second time as they re-commit their life to Christ as that is what is in their heart to do but they do not get anything more than the first time because the first time they do not ‘get’ anything as it is about what they ‘give’ …their testimony and commitment unto Christ who’s Grace saved them.
In some countries, where Christians are persecuted, baptism separates the true believers from the phonies. You open yourself to persecution by being baptized
The act of baptism cannot save anyone. We are saved only God’s grace through faith in Christ (Eph. 2:8, 9)
To say that a person that has repented of their sins , ask Jesus to forgive their sins , the person wants to tell the world what Jesus has done for them and lives for Jesus every moment of their life and has not yet been dunked in water is not saved is simply not what scripture teaches . You should acknowledge that all those scriptures you post are not addressing people who have already accepted Jesus as their savoir ,
Doug “thou doth protest too much”
Let  Jesus be the savoir
In the name of Christ Yeshua be blessedHello Thomas, in the context of Scripture, salvation means deliverance from all the power and effects of sin, and it has past, present,and future aspects.
Salvation by grace through faith. A person can do nothing to save himself. No amount of good works or adherence to law can save him. “For by grace are ye saved through faith;and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works,lest any man should boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9). Salvation is a free gift from God, which man cannot merit, earn, or deserve. The atoning work of Jesus Christ has made this free gift of salvation available, and the only way to receive it is to believe
in Jesus and in the sufficiency of His sacrifice (Romans 3:24-28; 4:22-25).Saving faith. To believe on Jesus includes believing His Word, and truly believing His Word includes obedience. Faithis more than mental assent, intellectual acceptance, or verbal profession; it includes trust, reliance, commitment, appropriation,
and application. We cannot separate saving faith from obedience (Acts 6:7; Romans 1:5; 2:6-10; 10:16; 16:26; Hebrews 11:6-8). Obedience to God’s Word is absolutely necessary to salvation (Matthew 7:21-27; John 14:15, 23; Romans 6:17; 15:18; II Thessalonians 1:7-10; Hebrews 5:9; I Peter1:21-23; 4:17; I John 2:3-5; 5:1-3). Faith is alive only through response and action (James 2:14-26). It is possible to have an initial degree of faith in Christ and still not be saved if there is
not complete acceptance, commitment, and obedience (Matthew 7:21-23; John 2:23-25; 12:42-43; Acts 8:12-23;James 2:19).Faith is the means of appropriating God’s grace. It is the means by which people yield to God, obey His Word, and allow Him to perform His saving work in them. Saving faith,then, is (1) acceptance of the gospel of Jesus Christ as the sole means of salvation and (2) obedience to that gospel(application or appropriation of that gospel).The gospel and the new birth. The gospel of Jesus Christ is His death, burial, and resurrection for our salvation (I Corinthians15:1-4). A person responds to the gospel, or applies
the gospel to his life, by repentance from sin (death to sin),water baptism by immersion in the name of Jesus Christ (burial with Christ), and receiving the Holy Spirit (new life in Christ) (Acts 2:1-4, 38; Romans 6:1-7; 7:6; 8:2).Jesus said, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God” (John 3:5).When someone believes on Jesus Christ and obeys Acts 2:38, he experiences the birth of water and the Spirit. He is “born
again,” actually becoming a new creation (John 3:3, 7; II Corinthians 5:17). At repentance and water baptism, he buries the old sinful lifestyle, the record of past sins, and the death penalty for sin. When he receives the Holy Spirit he begins tolive a new, godly life. On the Day of Pentecost, the birthday of the New Testament
church, the apostle Peter preached the first gospel sermon to the crowds who had gathered to observe the newly Spirit-filled believers as they spoke in tongues and worshiped God. Convicted of their sins by his simple yet powerful message,the audience cried out, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?” (Acts 2:37). Peter gave a precise, complete, and unequivocal answer: “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost” (Acts 2:38).Those saved in the Gospels were saved under the Old Covenant while they awaited the New. The New Covenant did not come into effect until after Christ’s ascension (Luke 7:28;24:47-49; John 7:39; 16:7; Acts 1:4-8; Hebrews 9:14-17).Thus Acts 2:38 is the comprehensive answer to an inquiry
about New Testament conversion, expressing in a nutshell the proper response to the gospel.Not only did the Jews on Pentecost receive the Acts 2:38
experience, but so did the Samaritans, the apostle Paul, the Gentiles, and the disciples of John at Ephesus (Acts 8:12-17;9:17-18 with 22:16; 10:44-48; 19:1-6). In short, the New Testament message of salvation is repentance from sin, water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
and receiving the Holy Spirit with the initial sign of speaking in tongues. Repentance. Repentance is a turn from sin to God (Acts
26:18-20). It has three necessary aspects: an intellectual change (change of views), an emotional change (change of feelings), and a volitional change (voluntary change of purpose).It includes recognition of sin (Mark 2:17), confession of sin to God (Proverbs 28:13; I John 1:9), contrition or godly sorrow for sin (Psalm 51:17; II Corinthians 7:10), and a decision to forsake sin (Proverbs 28:13; Luke 3:7-8). With repentance comes the willingness to make restitution for past
sins as much as possible (Matthew 5:23-24; Luke 19:8). Repentance is the first response of faith to the call of God(Mark 1:15). It is absolutely necessary to salvation (Luke 13:3, 5; Acts 17:30; II Peter 3:9). Without repentance baptismis not effective, and without repentance a person cannot receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; 3:19).At repentance, a person begins to let God work in his life. He decides to turn away from sin and allows God to turn him. As part of the turn from sin, God enables him to break away from sinful habits and desires. As part of the turn to God,repentance prepares the way for him to have a personal relationship
with God, qualifying him for baptism of water and Spirit. The work of forgiveness and remission comes through repentance and water baptism (Acts 2:38). Repentance deals with a person’s sinful lifestyle, and baptism deals with the record and consequences of sin.Water baptism. Water baptism is part of salvation (I Peter 3:21). It expresses faith in God by obedience to His Word (Mark 16:16; Acts 2:41). The scriptural mode of baptism isimmersion in water, and only this method retains the biblical symbolism of baptism as a burial (Matthew 3:16; Acts 8:36-39; Romans 6:4). Faith in Christ and repentance fromsin are necessary to its validity; thus infant baptism is not proper (Matthew 3:6-11; Acts 2:38; 8:37).The biblical significance of water baptism is as follows: (1)God remits sins at water baptism (Acts 2:38; 22:16). God erases the record of sin and cancels its penalty. He washes away sins, burying them forever. (2) Baptism is part of thenew birth (John 3:5; Titus 3:5). (3) Baptism identifies a person with Jesus’ burial (Romans 6:4; Colossians 2:12). It indicates he died to sin by repentance and is burying his past sins,
the dominion of sin, and the sinful lifestyle. (4) Water baptism is part of the one baptism of water and Spirit that places believers into Christ (Romans 6:3-4; Galatians 3:27; Ephesians 4:5). It identifies them personally with Jesus and is part of the entrance into His family. (5) Baptism is part of spiritual circumcision (Colossians 2:11-13).The Bible teaches that baptism should be administered in the name of Jesus Christ. This means invoking the name ofJesus orally (Acts 22:16; James 2:7) and rebaptizing those who have been baptized some other way (Acts 19:1-5). The name of Jesus in the baptismal formula expresses faith in His
true identity, atoning work, and saving power and authority.The name of Jesus is the only saving name, the name by which to receive remission of sins, the highest name, and the name in which Christians are to say and do all things (Acts 4:12; 10:43; Philippians 2:9-11; Colossians 3:17). Thus using
Jesus’ name is the proper way to fulfill all the purposes for baptism. The Bible records five historical accounts of baptism in theNew Testament church that describe a name or formula. In each case the name is Jesus (Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; 22:16). The epistles also allude to the Jesus Name formula
(Romans 6:3-4; I Corinthians 1:13; 6:11; Galatians 3:27; Colossians 2:12). Even Matthew 28:19 refers to this formula, for it describes a singular name that represents all the redemptive manifestations of the Godhead, and that name is Jesus (Zechariah 14:9; Matthew 1:21; John 5:43; 14:26; Revelation22:3-4). Moreover, Jesus is the name described in the other Great Commission accounts (Mark 16:17; Luke 24:47).The baptism of the Holy Spirit. The baptism with, by, in
or of the Holy Ghost (Holy Spirit) is part of New Testament salvation (John 3:5; Romans 8:1-16; I Corinthians 12:13;Ephesians 1:13-14; Titus 3:5). The phrase describes how the believer is immersed in and filled with God’s Spirit. In Acts the terms “baptized, filled, received, fell on, came upon, and poured out the gift on” all describe this experience (Acts 1:4-5; 2:4; 10:44-47; 11:15-17; 19:1-6). It is promised to all who believe on Jesus and obey His Word (John 7:38-39; Acts
5:32; 11:15-17; 19:2; Galatians 3:14; Ephesians 1:13).The Bible records five historical accounts of receiving the Holy Spirit in the New Testament church: the Jews, the Samaritans, the Gentiles, the apostle Paul, and the disciples of John at Ephesus. This record establishes that the baptism of the Spirit is indeed for everyone (Luke 11:13; Acts 2:39) and is accompanied by the initial sign of tongues (Mark 16:17). Speaking in tongues means speaking supernaturally,as the Spirit gives utterance, in a language the speaker hasnever learned (Acts 2:1-11).Three of the accounts explicitly describe speaking in tongues as the initial evidence of receiving the Spirit. On the Day of Pentecost, a sound of wind signified the coming of the Spirit and tongue-like flames signaled the availability to each person, but speaking in tongues “as the Spirit gave them utterance” was the initial sign of each individual filling (Acts 2:1-4). Tongues convinced skeptical, astonished Jews that the Gentiles had just received the Holy Ghost; tongues alone sufficiently identified this as the Pentecostal experience (Acts 10:44-47; 11:15-17).
The Ephesian disciples also spoke in tongues as the first sign of receiving the Spirit (Acts 19:6). Tongues are implicit in the other two accounts. An unnamed
miraculous sign indicated the exact moment the Samaritans received the Spirit; its prior absence denoted theydid not already have the Spirit despite joy, belief, and baptism, and it was so spectacular that Simon the Magician coveted the power to bestow the Spirit with this sign (Acts 8:5-19). Acts 9:17 mentions Paul’s experience without description, but I Corinthians 14:18 says he spoke in tongues often. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the normal, basic NewTestament experience with God, the birth of the Spirit. The Spirit is the rest, guide to all truth, adopter, intercessor, seal, earnest of the inheritance, and sanctifier (Isaiah 28:11-12; John 16:13; Romans 8:15, 26; Ephesians 1:13-14; I Peter 1:2). Someone can receive the Spirit by repenting, having faith in God, and asking God for His gift. When a person receives the Holy Spirit, he receives power to overcome sin and live a holy life (Acts 1:8; Romans 8:4, 13). If he lets the Spirit continually fill (control and guide) him, he will bear the fruit of the Spirit and become Christ-like (Galatians 5:22-23).In summary, (1) the Bible is the sole authority for salvation; (2) the basis of salvation is Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection; (3) salvation comes only by grace through faith in Jesus Christ; and (4) the application of grace and the expression of faith come as a person obeys Acts 2:38, thereby receiving the new birth of John 3:3-5.
 Thank you for your post, have a blessed day.Fact is Doug in all your words you copy paste NONE of them address people who have ALREADY repented ,m Already Ask Gods forgiveness Already done everything Jesus and the apostles teach except getting wet
you refuse to acknowledge that all the scriptures you post are for those who have not repented have not acknowledge they need a savoir .
.
another way of making this clear is to use an illustration. Let’s suppose that a person, under the conviction of the Holy Spirit (John 16:8), believed in Jesus as his savior (Rom. 10:9-10; Titus 2:13), and has received Christ (John 1:12) as Savior. Is that person saved? Of course, he is. Let’s further suppose that this person confesses his sinfulness, cries out in repentance to the Lord, and receives Jesus as Savior and then walks across the street to get baptized at a local church. In the middle of the road, he gets hit by a car and is killed. Does he go to heaven or hell? If he goes to heaven, then baptism is not necessary for salvation. If he goes to hell, then trusting in Jesus, by faith, is not enough for salvation. Doesn’t that go against the Scriptures that say that salvation is a free gift (Rom. 6:23) received by faith (Eph. 2:8-9)?Saying that baptism is necessary for salvation is dangerous because it is saying that there is something we must do to complete salvation. That is wrong! See Gal. 2:21; 5:4.All right, so this sounds reasonable. But still, what about those verses that seem to say that baptism is part of salvation?
——
your responses continue to ignore the real life situations as you cannot respond to the real issues without acknowledging you are not accepting of all Gods Grace what is also noted is that you on one hand say that in the OT there are different requirement(dispensation) for salvation that baptism what not needed in that time , then on the other you say that in the OT baptism was present …
Your teaching is like those who came to my door to tell me about their religion and how they interpret the bible and when I showed them scripture that refuted what they teach they just got angry and said ‘you have been warned’ and got on their bikes and rode away
“thou doth protest too much”
Let Jesus be the savoir
In the name of Christ YeshuaThomas, Let me ask you this: What does this scripture mean? Mark 16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
And What does this scripture say about baptism? Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. What is baptism for?Doug,
Answer to your question is :
John 3
15 that WHOEVER BELIEVES in Him should not perish but have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that WHOEVER BELIEVES in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him 18 WHOEVER BELIEVES in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.
.
You simply will not accept that the scripture NEVER says anything about those who have repented and asked for forgiveness of sins and proclaim Jesus saved them and did not get wet will not enter heaven!!
We agree that we need to get baptized but you don’t understand that if a person repents and receives Jesus forgiveness and the Holy spirit enters the person at THAT Moment!!
At the moment a person confesses their sins and asks for  forgiveness and asks Jesus to enter their heart is when the Holy Spirit enters their body !!
Holy Spirit does NOT wait until a person gets wet!
In your view a person can repent and for Jesus to be Lord of their life and then proceed to go to church to be baptized and die before they arrive at the church will suffer eternal damnation because they did not get to church to get wetEph
13 And you also were included in Christ when you Heard the message of truth, the gospel of Your Salvation. When you Believed, You Were Marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
.
This happens as soon as a person repents and asks Jesus for forgiveness…note this is not what is called the baptism of the Holy Spirit , that comes later , all the those in the upper room who received the baptism of the Holy Ghost were already believers follower of ChristWhat is the Gospel of your salvation? 1 Corinthians 15:1-4) Death, Burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. That is the Gospel that saves you. (REPENT=DEATH,  JESUS NAME WATER BAPTISM=BURIAL and HOLY SPIRIT=RESURRECTION).
And if you look at the opening of this letter, who is it addressed to?  “to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:” They had already been through the plan of Salvation. The where taught the same thing Peter said on the day of Pentecost. They received and obeyed Acts 2:38. The Apostles believed and they had been Baptized. They didn’t get the Holy Spirit until the day of Pentecost after Jesus had been taken up into heaven and the Holy Ghost was poured out. And when we read Ephesians it really isn’t broken down into chapters it a letter. So Paul says later in this same letter, ” There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; 5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.Thomas, I have answered this question over and over. If you repent, you receive forgiveness, but you do not receive remission of your sins until you are baptized in Jesus Name. The only name under heaven and earth given among men, whereby we must be saved. Scripture says, Baptism is for the remission of sins. Not just belief. Here is your quote “We agree that we need to get baptized.” Why do you believe you need to be baptized? Because according to you, all you need is to believe.
So now you are saying you need to get baptized.
And you say that the Holy Spirit enters a person at belief. The scripture that we have to show that this can happen, Acts 10, Peter Commanded them to be baptized. He didn’t say you should do this as an outward sign of an inward change. And where in the Bible is that scripture that says baptism is an outward sign of an inward change? I have shared scripture with you, that shows Jesus himself said “believe and is Baptized shall be saved. So even if there was no other scripture, that one should show you. But Peter says it 1 Peter 3:21 and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also, not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God.It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. (Romans 6:3) Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. 5 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
If all baptism is to you is getting wet, as you put it. You just don’t see it, my friend.
I don’t answer hypothetical questions, because our human mind is carnal and we can rationalize anything if we are making up a scenario. What I do is try to show people what the word says so they can make up there own mind. I am sorry if it appears to anyone, that I am anything but sincere. But sometime through word on a screen, you can not see someone’s true intent or heart. I have come out of the teaching that all one must do is believe. But the day that my eyes were open to the scripture of Baptism in Jesus Name for the remission of sin, I responded to that word and my life has been changed. This is why I am passionate. But everyone of us must work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. God bless you.Repent= CHANGE ONE’S MIND!

Bless you Doug , hoping you will research what the scripture really says 🙂Thomas, call me on Monday morning and lets talk. Obviously there is some confusion. 1-800-end-time.Doug the only confusion here is that you think that without the public display of our repentant heart is what saves us , and that is not true , we are saved when we asked God to save us , then after we are saved we comply with the command to be baptized in water which SYMBOLICALLY in a visual way that the public can see and God can see us going on record publicly that we will serve God ,your refusal to acknowledge this and your refusal to see the simplicity that baptism only displays visually what happens in the heart , the word baptism represents ‘dipping’ like when Jesus told Judas that the one who dips his hand in the bowl with him will be the one who betrays Jesus
You saying you refuse to speak to real life drama of people dying before they can be dipped in water is just your way of refusing to say people do get accepted into the kingdom without being dunked in water , since you insist that a person is not saved until being dunked in water ..Okay Thomas,
Please show me the scripture that says baptism is an outward sign of an inward change.
Also please tell what does this scripture say baptism is for?  “and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,” Acts 2:38
And if baptism is for a public display, where was everyone when the Eunuch went down into the water? Acts 8:29-40
And what was Saul/Paul told to do? “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” Acts 22:16
I do not insist that you must be baptized, Jesus does. Mark 16:16, Mathew 28:19, John 3:3-5 and Acts 2:38.Doug you on a power trip  pride is in your way , if you only knew who all is watching this thread….. you costing the ministry money  over your pride …they will be ordering elsewhere ..tried to post several times ,,your pride causes your fall , all you had to do was agree to disagreeDoug
There are errors in your understanding of repentance it really means to have a change of mind a change of heart …a change of how a person feels this is why the scipture tells us to repent
Some say the dying to self compares exclusivly in a symbolic sense
You can say “flower”  or you can look at a picture of a flower but it represents the same …repenting in the heart aquires salvation when the heart felt change of mind is verbally stated audibly which is why when we confess our sins we say it out loud with our mouth
Only after we repent of our sins with our mouth outwardly audibly then the Holy Spirit seals us with the mark of our Holy God
Then after this hapoens we then publicly display our conversion of our repentance through the water baptism
Baptism is the visual way we show or repentant heart which God forgives us of our sins
God BlessHello Lynn,
 I understand what repent means. If a person truly has a repented heart they are dying of themselves and making a discussion to turn from the way they have lived to the way God wants them to live. But scripture itself tells us what baptism is for. Scripture says Baptism in Jesus name is to remit your sins. There is no scripture that says baptism is an outward sign of an inward change. The bible says clearly, how to obey the gospel, this is what all the Apostles and Disciples taught. Acts 2:38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
This is why we teach what we teach. Thank you and have a blessed day.Doug
The order for me was:-
1) Repented / received Christ (- I was conscious all of this time of the Spirits enabling me to overcome sin and make the Bible come alive / make complete sense etc – I knew the difference as I had been reading the Bible for quite a few months beforehand and got its meaning all wrong before) THEN 5.5 weeks later…
2) Baptism in the Holy Spirit – ie with tongues
3) Water Baptism (2.5 weeks after BoHS)Also the ‘thief on the cross’ incident tells us that baptism isn’t  a pre-req:Rom
9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.This blog is in danger of needing to be renamed. I know its an important topic but it has been overdone on this particular blog….Okay Kev,
Thank you, have a great day!When we die,  just as Lazarus – we sleep,  a dreamless sleep. At Christ’s second coming,  “the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we (believers) which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord. ”  1Thessalonians 4:16, 17 KJV
So when we die we go to the grave, our breath/soul goes back to God & there we stay, in the grave, until the Second Coming  of Jesus.Doug
If you look into the Original Greek you will find the word remmision means forgiveness of debt /transgressionss /sins..etc ..it seems that you prefer to think that a person has to be dunked in water before they can be with Jesus . As it is said Jesus forgives and not water . Reason being baptizef in Jesus name is to state to the public you belong to Jesus ..Phillip was the public when the eunich was baptized …public means being not by yourself ..so that someone else can testify that you got baptized in Jesus name ..Do you know that Apostle Peter denied being a follower of Jesus 3 times ? So after Jesus rose from the grave it was given that from then on be baptized in Jesus name .All scripture teaching os tied together ….when 2 or more are gathered in Jesus name he is there
You can believe as you wish but it is what is in a persons heart and mouth that saves a people not water . We get baptized in obedience as compared ti any other command given  by Jesus .Paul testifies how hard it is to live up to Jesus commands …Jesus will not reject people that did not get baptized as Jesus knows that people will si  again after baptism as it is not possible to stop all sins which is why the 10 commandments can not be perfectly adhered to …A person asks for forgiveness of sins each tume they sin and are forgiven and dont get baptized after every time they ask to be forgiven .. If you actually met people who have family that repented and ask Jesus to be their Lord and died before they could be baptized yoi would be better able to understand this  ….Okay thank you Lynn








 How is it possible that thousand-year-old depictions of the Anunnaki show the gods carrying a mysterious bag, and half way around the world we find the same thing depicted by ancient Mesoamerican civilizations? Depicted by the ancient Sumerian representations of the Anunnaki, the mysterious ‘handbag’ of the Gods is seen in several cultures in America and Göbekli Tepe. Coincidence? Compelling evidence—found in the last couple of decades—has proven mankind is a species with amnesia. The countless discoveries made all across the globe has forced us to question everything about the origin of mankind, ancient cultures and history in general.Slowly and piece by piece, we have been exploring and gathering small pieces of a MASSIVE puzzle that have driven us in the right direction when searching for answers mainstream scholars have not been able to fully answer.How can you explain the countless similarities among civilizations that inhabited Earth thousands of years ago, which were separated by tens of thousands of kilometers?Why did nearly all ancient cultures on Earth decide to build Pyramids? And why are so many pyramids eerily similar?It’s as if nearly all ancient civilizations followed the same blueprint. It’s as if somehow, ancient cultures were interconnected thousands of years ago.One of the most interesting and mind-boggling enigmas can be traced back to Ancient Mesopotamia—comonly referred to as the Cradle of Civilization—where a mysterious motif has driven many authors to question history as we have been taught.The ancient Sumerians depicted the Ancient Anunnaki with curious items. Two of the most interesting objects seen in the ancient Sumerian deities were the ‘hand watch’ seen on nearly all depictions, and the mysterious ‘bag’ carried by the Gods.Curiously, if we travel thousands of kilometres around the globe from Mesopotamia to the Americas, we will find that the ancient Maya, Aztecs and other ancient civilizations utilized the same motif when depicting their deities.Furthermore, if ew travel to Egypt we will see that the Ankh symbol was also carried around by the gods just as the mystery handbag in ancient Mesopotamia and the Americas.Why is it that ancient civilizations in America, Egypt, and ancient Mesopotamia depicted their deities carrying a mysterious object in their hand? Is it possible that all ancient cultures in America, Egypt and Mesopotamia were visited by the same ‘Gods’?Interestingly, the Ancient Anunnaki were nearly always represented in a humanoid form, even though numerous traits indicate clear differences between the Anunnaki and ordinary humans, the facial features of the Ancient Anunnaki Gods were always well-hidden thanks to the large beards.Just as the ancient Sumerians depicted their deities in a humanoid for, the Ancient Egyptians, and different cultures in the Americas did the same thing.The obvious question here is why? Why did ancient cultures—separated thousands of kilometers from each other—depict their deities in a nearly identical way? Furthermore, how is it even possible that the Ancient Sumerians depicted their gods carrying a mysterious bag, and that people half way across the world did the same thing?At the archeological site of La Venta, we will find a stone stele depicting the ancient Mesoamerican God Quetzalcoatl, who is curiously holding in his hand the same ‘Bag’ we see in ancient Sumerian depictions.But this isn’t the only site in Mexico where the curious representation was found.If we travel to Tula—an important regional center which reached its height as the capital of the Toltec Empire between the fall of Teotihuacan and the rise of Tenochtitlan—we will find their massive ‘Atlantean’ statues, and if we observe closer, we will notice that once again the mysterious handbag is present.Toltec temple ruins in Tula, Mexico Credit: PinterestIf we travel to Göbekli Tepe, located on a remote hilltop in southern Turkey we will find the same THING.Göbekli Tepe is one of the oldest (if not oldest) ancient megalithic temples on our planet. There, intricate massive stone pillars arranged into a set of rings stand tall and proud telling a millennia-old story when different civilizations ruled the over the planet. The massive stones were believed to have been carved by neolithic hunter-gatherers some 12,000 years ago, even though recent evidence points towards the fact thatThe mysterious temple, which consists of three huge stone circles was deliberately buried for an unknown reason in the distant past. After 13 years of digging, archaeologists investigating the ancient site have failed to recover a single stone-cutting tool. No one has been able to understand how ancient mankind, which was believed to be incapable of such feasts, erected some of the greatest stone-works on the planet.Does the presence of the mysterious bag, carried by the gods, indicate that these two cultures connected in a mysterious way?Why did ancient cultures depict their Gods carrying the mysterious handbag? What was inside it?And most importantly, how is it even possible that the mysterious handbag is present in different civilizations around the globe—which according to mainstream scholars were never connected?What if the Ancient Anunnaki—depicted by the Ancient Sumerians—and the Gods who visited the ancient Maya, Aztec, Toltec and Olmec civilizations are in fact the SAME?What do you think this mysterious bag is mean to represent? Do you think it is just a coincidence that these three sites—and there are more—feature all the same thing? What could have been carried by the ‘Gods’ that was so important that nearly all ancient cultures had to illustrate it?








There are 300 or more different species of Aloe. The most prominent variety, Aloe barbadensis, Miller commonly referred to as Aloe vera, is especially noted for its amazing healing abilities. Although Aloe vera resembles a cactus, it actually belongs to the family of liliaceous plants and is indigenous to subtropical regions and deserts.The etymology of the word Aloe is Arabic; It’s derived from the Arabic word “Alloeh,” which means: “shining bitter substance.” While the word “vera” stems from Latin and means “true.” 6,000 year old stone carvings containing images of Aloe vera plants have been found in Egypt, where Aloe vera was known as the “plant of immortality”. In fact, it was commonly given to deceased pharaohs as a burial gift!  2000 years ago Greek scientists deemed Aloe vera the “universal panacea.” Historically, Aloe vera has been successfully used by traditional medicine practitioners in many disparate cultures including: Greece, Egypt, India, Mexico, Japan and China. According to legend, Egyptian queens Nefertiti and Cleopatra used it as part of their regular beauty regimes. Alexander the Great and Christopher Columbus used it to treat soldiers’ wounds. The first reference to Aloe vera in English was a translation by John Goodyew in A.D. 1655 of Dioscorides’ Medical treatise De Materia Medica. Aloe vera was first used as a laxative in the United States in the 1880’s. In the mid-1930s, it was used successfully to reverse chronic and severe radiation dermatitis. “The potency of Aloe vera is due to its rich variety of ingredients which are present in perfect balance and work together as a team. Although the solid portion of the plant forms only 1%-1.5%, the rest being water, this small amount of active ingredient can produce a substantial effect. The only way to account for this is to accept the philosophy of synergism within the plant. Synergism means that the effect of the whole is greater than the effects of the component parts, so although individual members of the team could only have an effect, together they can achieve a great deal more.” Aloe Vera – The Medicine Plant’, Dr Peter Atherton, p25• The Rind –  is the tough outer layer and is where the synthesis and production of all the nutrients in Aloe Vera takes place
• The Sap – is bitter and contains anthraquinones (latex)
• The Mucilage layer – is rich in long chain sugars called polysaccharides
• The Inner Leaf Gel – is sterile and can be used immediately and contains the majority of nutrients in the Aloe Vera plant • Six Aloe leaves (depending on size) from a mature and healthy plant. Leaves that are anywhere from four (4) to six (6) inches in length make a generous 1/4-cup amount. 
• A clean sharp knife
• A clean cutting board and work surface
• A clean Glass container (It’s best to store your gel in the fridge preferably in a dark or opaque glass container to protect it from light which can degrade it). Make sure the jar has a secure fitting lid to keep air out.
• Food processor or blender
• Paper towels
• Spoon and spatula 
* Optional: rubber gloves to protect your hands from the serrated edges of the leaf. 1. Begin by washing your hands. You don’t want to introduce any unwanted bacteria into your gel and contaminate it. Make sure your work surface, and utensils are clean when preparing your gel.
2. Choose leaves that are mature, thick, fleshy and a deep green in color. Look for leaves that are at least 4-6 inches in length. The oldest and largest outermost leaves near the bottom of the plant are ideal; they contain a thick, nutrient-rich gel layer. Did you know that cut Aloe leaves do not grow back? However, the cut leaves will eventually stimulate the emergence of new growth from the center of the plant. 3. Remove the leaves. Use a sharp knife to create a clean cut, without harming the plant of course. Cut close to the base of the leaf and slice away from the center of the plant. Or you can buy cut Aloe leaves at select stores or online.4. Rinse the outer skin of the leaves and knife under running water. Now place the cut leaves in a bowl at a 45 degree angle for 15 minutes or so. This step enables the dark yellow, very bitter Aloe juice or latex to drain out, which is found in the cells located just under the surface of the leaf. The latex is a very powerful laxative, which can irritate the intestines. The laxative effect could cause potassium levels to become low.5. Now carefully remove the serrated edges and skin. Mature Aloe Vera leaves are slightly curved. Place the concave side down on a cutting board. Next, slice around the perimeter. This will leave you with the top and bottom layer of skin, exposing the Aloe gel in between. The top layer of skin comes off next. Run the knife just under the surface and peel it away. Now you can flip the leaf over and do the same to the other side.6. Remove the gel from each leaf and place it in a clean jar until you’re ready to process the batch in a blender or a food processor.7. Transfer the gel into a food processor and process until it’s uniformly mixed. Next add a scant quarter teaspoon of vitamin C powder (100% Pure Powder; non-GMO, Pharmaceutical Grade (USP); GMP Quality Assured in the form of ascorbic acid to every cup of gel. It neutralizes oxygen on contact thus acting as a preservative. Or you can add 400 IU of vitamin E. In its natural form, vitamin E is designated d-, as in-d-alpha-tocopherol (recommended). You can also use grapefruit extract as a preservative. Add the gel and your choice of preservative in the food processor or blender and thoroughly mix or you can manually stir it into the processed gel with a spoon.  8. Store in the fridge in a glass container with a tight lid and label (include the date made). Fresh Aloe gel usually keeps for about a week in the fridge, but with a preservative it will last much longer, up to a month or so. Still it’s best to make small batches and replace as necessary to maintain the utmost potency and freshness. Use a clean spoon to scoop into your gel even if you are going to apply it topically as fingers can introduce unwanted bacteria into the gel.DOSAGEDr. Andrew Weil recommends the following Aloe vera dosage guidelines: For internal use of aloe gel, 30 ml three times a day. Topically, apply the fresh gel as needed. Suggested Dosage from Lily of the Desert (internal): Take 2 ounces (4 Tbsp) per serving alone or mixed with a favorite juice 2x a day. For serious conditions take up to 8 ounces daily.Of course, if you are planning on using Aloe vera internally as a tonic or a medicine, you will need quite a few Aloe plants or you can buy organic, mature, Aloe vera leaves here.  “Based on studies and clinical applications Aloe vera has been shown beyond a doubt to have immense potential therapeutically. Aloe vera is used medicinally both externally and internally.
Aloe vera is the single most healing of all the herbs. It’s anti-cancer, anti-parasitic, and it repairs DNA. It protects us from viruses and bacteria. Every time I take juice, I take aloe, and it makes a big difference.”– Gary Nulls Ultimate Anti Aging Program by Gary Null, Ph.D.Skin CancerSeveral new studies have found that Aloe Vera can prevent and even treat melanoma. Research from the University of Belgrade’s School of Medicine confirmed that the constituents in Aloe Vera stops proliferation (rapidly multiplication) of cells that morph into tumors via skin cancer. The researchers found that Aloe-emodin stopped cell proliferation. The researchers concluded that although isolated aloe compounds were protective, the whole herb extracts were superior. http://www.realnatural.org/aloe-vera-treats-and-prevents-skin-cancer/Other studies have also demonstrated aloe’s ability to stop the progression of skin cancer when applied  directly on the skin.

Aloe vera contains acemannan, a natural immune booster. Go to Google Scholar  and peruse the links to studies about the anti-cancer effects of acemannan.South Korea’s Gachon University of Medicine and Science found that Aloe-emodin stopped the growth of human cancerous liver cells and induced cell death among tumor cells.In 2010, researchers from the China Medical University that Aloe constituents Emodin and Rhein also produced anticancer effects, which included stopping tumor progression and inducing cell death in cancer cells.Halts Cancerous Growth

Three of the groups challenging the reform agenda of President-elect Donald Trump and his education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos received more than $2.6 million from teachers unions and their allies, according to federal labor filings.DeVos, a pioneer in the school choice and charter school movements over the last two decades, has received vocal opposition from Democrats and some of the country’s most powerful unions. The National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers, and AFL-CIO, which serves as an umbrella group for dozens of unions including the AFT, have all called on the Senate to reject the nomination.Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.comThey have also pumped millions of dollars into think tanks and activist groups that have supplied Democrats with intellectual ammunition to oppose her.DeVos, the head of the American Federation for Children, has come under scrutiny from a number of liberal groups and media outlets, along with unions. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) and Center for American Progress (CAP) have each released reports critical of charter schools since President-elect Donald Trump announced the nomination in November.EPI released a study on Nov. 30 blaming the rise of charter schools for creating “inefficiencies and redundancies within district boundaries, from the organization and delivery of educational programs to student transportation, increasing the likelihood of budgetary stress on the system as a whole, and the host government in particular.”The report, written by Rutgers University Prof. Bruce Baker, argued that giving students the ability to enroll in schools outside of their low-performing district school raised transportation costs, increased congestion, and diverted money away from “unified education systems.” The report has also been used to criticize DeVos‘ approach to education.EPI has received nearly $1.7 million from the NEA, AFT, and AFL-CIO since 2014, according to federal labor filings. The think tank, which describes itself as non-partisan, received more than $680,000 in 2015 alone from the three unions, and AFL-CIO footed the bill for catering costs at a January reception for the group that year. Those expenses were classified as “membership dues” and “support for economic policy research” on the Labor Department forms.EPI did not include a disclosure in the report or its press release, though it does provide a list of donors on its website. Unions made 27 percent of all contributions between 2010 and 2014.The Center for American Progress, the liberal think tank founded by former Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, has also been at the forefront over DeVos’ confirmation battle. Its lobbyists and officials have been quoted in numerous media outlets criticizing Trump’s decision as a “pay-to-play nomination.” It released an analysis on Thursday of her family’s political donations to Republican lawmakers on Thursday, saying that they constituted a “conflict of interest.”The analysis did not disclose that CAP and its advocacy arm CAP Action Fund has received about $800,000 in contributions and grants from the NEA, AFT, and AFL-CIO since 2014. Labor unions have reported a range of purposes for the expenses to the group, including “member education costs,” contribution,” and “natl partnership grant.” CAP did not respond to request for comment about those donations.The Partnership for Working Families has also gotten involved in the fight against DeVos through its In the Public Interest project. The group has helped organize activists online to oppose her nomination, directing liberals to networking avenues to contact lawmakers and local media outlets.“Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for Education Secretary, wants to steer public money to charter schools, online learning, and voucher programs. But those of us who believe all kids deserve a quality education are gearing up for a fight,” In the Public Interest said in an online fundraising appeal.The Partnership for Working Families received more than $135,000 from AFL-CIO in 2015 and 2016, according to the union’s Labor Department filings. The payments were made to “support research/devlpmnt strategy on raising wages” and “support [the] Power for Working Families” campaign.” Neither the Partnership, nor In the Public Interest responded to request for comment.Trump transition team expected to meet resistance to DeVos’ nomination. Phillip Stutts, who worked for the Department of Education under President George W. Bush before founding Go Big Media, has advised DeVos for the past two months. He had previously worked closely with DeVos to elect school choice supporters in Louisiana. DeVos’ efforts led to the rapid expansion of charter school in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. He said that the force of opposition reflects the impact that she has had in the school reform movement.“Before Betsy DeVos, nobody challenged teachers unions. … The unions don’t have a monopoly on legislative or political power anymore. That’s her legacy,” he said.Stutts added that lawmakers and the public would be able to see beyond the union caricature when she appears before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Tuesday.“She has always asked herself: ‘does this policy put kids first?’ This is somebody who demands results and wants to see more accountability,” he said. “The power of unions will continue to erode when all they care about is their own power, membership dues, and putting adults before children.”BY:  Bill McMorris








Some businesses in Washington state aren’t going to be as lucky as Boeing.From MyNorthwest.com:  Democrats hope to rely partly on higher business taxes to comply with a court ruling on state education funding. But The Boeing Co. would be exempt. In announcing their budget plan Monday, House Democrats didn’t explain why Boeing wouldn’t be included, other than to say it was a compromise made to ensure their plan would move forward.The aerospace company has benefited much from tax breaks in recent history. Just last year, for example, The Seattle Times reported tax breaks saved Boeing about $500 million over the past two years. In 2014, Boeing saved $217 million. In 2015, it saw a savings of $305.More tax breaks would come as Boeing trims its workforce in order to stay competitive in the market. At least 170 Boeing workers in the Puget Sound area received layoff notices on March 17.When it comes to the budget, Representative Kristine Lytton says another exception will have to be made when it comes to class sizes. “While we continue to make progress on class size reduction we do delay the provisions of Initiative 1351 for another two years as we continue to focus on more pressing needs moving forward,” she said.Overall, the Democratic budget includes more than $7 billion in additional funding for education over the next four years. The Democrats’ $44 billion budget includes about $3 billion in new taxes. The Democratic budget relies on raising business taxes and a new 7 percent capital gains tax.Tacoma Representative Laurie Jenkins says Washington state is one of the only states that doesn’t tax capital gains right now. “We are so outside the mainstream and how we’re handling capital gains in the fact that we’re not handling it at all.”Funding education may be the priority, but Democrats say their budget proposal would also support some of the state’s most vulnerable by pumping billions into human service programs.It’s a stark contrast to the Republican proposal released last week, which relies on government cuts and a property tax swap to fund education.Republican Senator John Braun says the House plan uses education as an excuse to raise taxes for everything else. “Our proposal and their proposal is similar. If anything we’re higher in K-12, and yet they need $8 billion over the next four years to pay for theirs. That tells me these taxes are not about K-12. They are about everything but K-12.”DCG








Four state attorneys have filed a suit in an effort to ‘stop the Obama administration from handing control of the internet’s naming system to ICANN’, according to a report by a leading technology magazine.The suit was filed in the Southern District of Texas, and aims to block a change to the oversight of the internet’s domain name system, which is currently administered by California-based ICANN. 








Каждый житель мегаполиса мечтает иметь дачу, где можно построить дом, выращивать овощи и ягоды, наслаждаться свежим воздухом и жарить шашлыки. Земля в пригороде стоит дешево, поэтому каждый горожанин имеет возможность приобрести несколько соток. На даче обязательно должен быть благоустроенный комфортный домик. В последние годы для строительства загородных коттеджей используется камень, кирпич, панели и каркас, но лучшим материалом по-прежнему остается дерево. Экологически чистые, теплые, надежные пиломатериалы, вдобавок ко всем своим преимуществам, отличаются экономичностью. Дом из бруса возводится достаточно быстро, поскольку для него не нужно закладывать фундамент и годами ждать усадки.Дерево имеет особый, специфический запах, который трудно воссоздать и сохранить искусственным путем. Дома из бруса или досок отлично сохраняют тепло зимой и охлаждаются летом.К другим преимуществам постройки деревянного домика можно отнести:Для строительства загородного коттеджа лучше использовать ценные породы древесины – дуб, бук, ясень или лиственница цена во всех случаях будет примерно одинакова. Используя качественный пиломатериал, можно построить дом своей мечты, приложив минимум усилий, времени и средств.








INTERPOL has turned into an arena where Serbia and Kosovo exchange mutual accusations and the prosecution of war crimes has turned into a political weapon.In early January 2017, Ramush Haradinaj, former Prime Minister of Kosovo and commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), was arrested by French authorities. The arrest was made based on an INTERPOL notice requested by Serbia in 2004. The District Court of Belgrade accuses Haradinaj of war crimes allegedly committed in Kosovo during the conflict in 1999.This is not the first time that a high-ranking Kosovo politician and former KLA member is arrested on the basis of an international wanted notice issued by Serbia. Haradinaj was already arrested in 2015 in Slovenia, but the authorities released him immediately as they accorded him diplomatic immunity. Former Prime Minister and KLA commander Agim Ceku, as well as other senior figures of the KLA, were arrested on several occasions and released. Following Haradinaj’s recent arrest, Serbia’s Prime Minister Vucic immediately announced that Serbia would request his extradition to Serbia.Haradinaj was already tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and he was acquitted. Serbia claims to have new evidence for war crimes allegedly committed by Haradinaj for which he should be tried in Serbia. The French infuriated the Serbs when a French court released Haradinaj on bail pending a final decision on his extradition.Most European countries consider international wanted notices issued by Serbia against former KLA members for war crimes committed in Kosovo as politically motivated and refuse to implement them. The United Nations, which still runs the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), submitted several protests against Serbian international wanted notices for war crimes allegedly committed by Kosovars in Kosovo. The United Nations claims that under United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which established UNMIK, Serbia’s jurisdiction over Kosovo is suspended.The Kosovo government, which declared independence in 2008, claims to have sovereign jurisdiction over Kosovo and requested UNMIK on several occasions to protest against Serbia’s claim to exercise jurisdiction over Kosovo. Kosovo is not a member of INTERPOL and communicates with INTERPOL only through UNMIK, which has a formal arrangement in place which authorizes UNMIK as a point of contact for INTERPOL in respect of Kosovo.Despite these protests, Serbia continues to assert jurisdiction over Kosovo by prosecuting war crimes committed in Kosovo as it rejects Kosovo’s independence and considers it to be part of the territory of Serbia.So far, not a single high-ranking Kosovo politician has been extradited to Serbia for war crimes, and Serbia has certainly realized that it is unlikely that it will be able to get hold of former KLA commanders, now high-ranking Kosovo politicians, to try them before Serb courts. However, it is embarrassing for Kosovo politicians to be arrested for war crimes every time they travel abroad, and the possibility of arrest and eventual extradition to Serbia hangs like a Damocles sword over them. It is also the stigma of being internationally branded as a war criminal which makes such arrests a political issue.INTERPOL has thus turned into an arena where Serbia and Kosovo exchange mutual accusations of unlawful exercise of territorial jurisdiction, and the prosecution of war crimes has turned into a political weapon.This would not seem a big issue, as such incidents have happened already in the past without causing much political trouble, if the relations between Kosovo and Serbia had not further deteriorated in the past months.Kosovo’s declaration of independence in 2008 was fraught with tensions as Serbia refuses to recognize Kosovo’s independence. The predominantly Serbian population of the four northern municipalities, including the northern part of the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica, refused to accept Kosovo rule and, with the support of Serbia, maintained parallel security and administrative structures. An attempt by the Kosovo government in 2011 to extend its authority into the northern part of Kosovo resulted in an armed confrontation between Kosovo Police and Serbian parallel security structures.In order to gradually integrate the local Serbs into official Kosovo structures and to dismantle existing Serb parallel structures, the European Union (EU) initiated and facilitated a technical dialogue which resulted in 2013 in an agreement on principles on the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia. Multiple subsequent agreements followed, such as on border management, telecommunication, recognition of diplomas, etc.In spite of ongoing talks at technical level, both parties accuse each other of obstruction and failure to implement the agreements. Most of the agreements indeed lack implementation, which turns them effectively into dead letters. Kosovo considers that it is giving in too much, such as with the creation of an association of Serbian municipalities, which raises fears of developing into a structure like that of the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The Republika Srpksa is one of the two political entities that constitute BiH, and it openly advocates for secession from BiH and accession to Serbia. Its obstructive policies are perceived by Croats and Muslims, collectively the other entity that constitutes BiH, as the main source of BiH’s instability and dysfunctional government.Kosovo’s dragging on with the creation of the association was used by the Kosovo Serb political faction in Parliament as a pretext to leave the government and to publicly demonstrate allegiance to the Belgrade government. A Serb minister, who was appointed by the Kosovo Prime Minister, was urged by Belgrade to resign, which shows the level of control that Belgrade exercises over Kosovo Serbs. It did not take long for Serbs to announce that they would unilaterally create the association in February 2017 if Kosovo continues to drag on.Tensions started to increase when Serbs in Northern Mitrovica erected a wall in December 2016. Although the wall is small and certainly not comparable to the Berlin wall, it is perceived by Kosovo Albanians as a symbol of ethnic division and partition. Threats to remove the wall followed suit and were met with Kosovo Serbs warning that any attempt in this direction would spark tensions.An attempt by the Prime Minister of Kosovo to visit the northern municipalities in December 2016 was met with hostility by local Serbs who forced the Prime Minister to use the NATO force deployed in Kosovo to escort him to his destination. For Kosovo Albanians, this was an embarrassment and a sign of the weakness of the government to extent its sovereignty over the northern municipalities.Haradinaj’s arrest in France has to be seen in this context. While he is seen by the Serbs as a war criminal, for Kosovo Albanians he is a war hero. He gained much sympathy, locally and internationally, when, as Prime Minister, he quit his post and voluntarily surrendered to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which eventually acquitted him. He has a strong political base in Western Kosovo and is one of the main opposition leaders which makes him a significant political factor which must be taken seriously. A possible extradition of Haradinaj to Serbia would very likely have implications for the security situation in Kosovo.Immediately following Haradinaj’s arrest, Serbia’s President Nikolic declared that he would come to Kosovo on the occasion of the Orthodox Christmas celebration. This was seen by the Kosovo government as an outright provocation, and it declined permission for Nikolic to enter Kosovo.The latest increase in tensions was on January 14, when a train left Belgrade for Kosovo. What should look normal and a sign of free movement, in the context of relations between Kosovo and Serbia, was almost a cause of war. The Russian-sponsored train displayed slogans like “Kosovo is Serbia” and was decorated with religious and Serb nationalist motives, a clear provocation for the Albanians. Kosovo special police forces were immediately dispatched to the north, and the Kosovo government ordered that the train be prevented from entering Kosovo.And the train indeed returned without entering Kosovo, leaving Kosovo and Serb politicians to compete with each other as to who had actually ordered the return of the train. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksander Vucic’s public reaction was that Kosovo was provoking a conflict of broad proportions and was preparing war games for some time. Serbia’s President Nikolic spoke publicly about sending the army to Kosovo and soon media were full of prognosis of a new conflict between Kosovo and Serbia.Mutual accusations and provocations are now on the agenda and are likely to escalate in an atmosphere of growing mistrust and tensions between Kosovo and Serbia. The EU’s efforts to normalize relations through a technical dialogue have largely failed. The EU’s lukewarm reaction to the construction of the wall and the train incident do not contribute to an increase in the EU’s credibility and reliability as a facilitator of a dialogue which has lost meaning to Serbs and Albanians.If escalation is to be prevented, the format of talks between Kosovo and Serbia must change. A technical dialogue, which tries to avoid sensitive political issues, including the core issue of Kosovo’s statehood, makes no further sense.An attempt by the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, to calm down tensions by hosting a high-level meeting that included the Presidents and Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo resulted in the usual diplomatic lip-service to continue dialogue. As soon as the Presidents were home, they resumed accusations against each other of inciting conflict.If normalization between Kosovo and Serbia is to occur, the technical dialogue must be replaced by political negotiations which respect the political realities that have developed in Kosovo since 1999. Failure to elevate talks to this level as soon as possible will allow hard-liners on both sides to use war crimes prosecution, walls, and trains to escalate tensions.In view of the bleak prospects for stability in the Western Balkans, it is important for the EU to show more leadership and determination. A success in Kosovo would be important for restoring confidence in the EU as an international political actor. The current path taken by the EU in Kosovo will certainly not lead to this.Share:Rate:Tags: Bosnia and Herzegovina, EU, ICC, INTERPOL, Kosovo, Serbia, UN, War Crimes

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) has lost her mind, literally!  The woman continues a crusade against President Donald Trump and his administration colluding with Russia, which she has zero evidence.  On Monday evening, she took to the House floor and not only played the Communist Democrats' race card, but questioned the patriotism of the supporters of Donald Trump and said that her mission and goal was to see that Trump does not remain president.“Mr. Speaker, my position against this president and his administration is clear. I oppose this president. I do not honor this president. I do not respect this president,” Waters said.“African-Americans have struggled and fought historically," she added.  "Many African-Americans have paid a huge price fighting for justice and equality in this country, have died for it. I don’t have to call the names of Martin Luther King and all the others. We have paid a price, we have fought."Now, I don't know any "African-Americans."  I know there are Americans with dark skin, but I know of no African-Americans.  As for invoking Martin Luther King, Jr., Maxine Wates is about as far from his ideology as you can get.  Furthermore, Waters includes herself in having paid a price.  Right, Ms. Waters, you've never paid a price for what you speak and you are one that has so corrupted yourself in the system that you cannot be trusted.“But guess what?" she continued.  "Despite the fact that America has not always been there for us, we’ve always been there for America. We have fought in America’s wars. We have suffered discrimination, we have suffered isolation and undermining. But we stand up for America, oftentimes when others who think they are more patriotic, who say they are more patriotic, do not,” Waters said.Stand up for America?  You, Ms. Waters?  Was pushing through Obamacare, which no one wanted but Democrats and is killing heathcare in the country, along with the Middle Class, "standing up for America?"  Was allowing Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah's ineligibility to go unchallenged "standing up for America?"  Was allowing the documented crimes of Obama and his administration go without justice "standing up for America"?“When we fight against this president, and we point out how dangerous he is for this society and for this country, we’re fighting for the democracy," she said, oblivious to the fact that our Constitution states we have a republican form of government, not a democracy.  "We’re fighting for America. We’re saying to those who say they’re patriotic, but they’ve turned a blind eye to the destruction that he’s about to cause this country, ‘You’re not nearly as patriotic as we are.’”The destruction Trump is about to cause?  What about the destruction Obama has actually caused?  What about that Ms. Waters?The president “is not good for America,” she said.OK, stop.  Look, all of Trump's promises are not constitutional nor lawful.  That much is true.  However, the hypocrisy here is glaring for anyone that wants to rifle through the list of documented crimes by Obama, while Waters either sat silently by taking her Geritol or blabbering her mouth in defense of the usurper-in-chief.“African-Americans know this," she said.  "The Black Caucus understands this, and for those members of the Black Caucus representing our leadership, who went to meet with him, they have laid out to him all of this, what our care and concerns are all about. But in the final analysis, we really don’t expect anything from him."Right, except the welfare checks to those you represent, right?  Or the government health insurance?  Or the food stamps?  Isn't that right, Ms. Waters?  You expect all of that and you and your cronies will be kicking, screaming and crying until you get it.“And my mission and my goal is to make sure that he does not remain president of the United States of America,” Water said.Oh, I see, it's not that Trump has violated the Constitution, committed some other crime or anything that she can legitimately point to.  It's the fact, she doesn't like him.  Maybe, it's because he is white?  Could Maxine Waters be showing her true colors (pun intended) here?  It's quite possible she has.  Someone get this woman a New Black Panthers jacket so she can come on out of the closet already.








Courthouse News Service – by Glynis FarrellCHICAGO (CN) – Two Libertarian Party candidates convinced a federal judge that an Illinois law banning medical marijuana cultivation centers and dispensaries from making political campaign contributions violates free-speech rights.Libertarians Claire Ball and Scott Schulter sued Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and Illinois Board of Election officials in Chicago federal court in 2015. They support expanded legalization of marijuana and seek to legally solicit and accept political contributions from members of the medical marijuana industry.  State lawmakers passed the Medical Cannabis Act in 2013, which allows doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to patients with debilitating medical issues without facing criminal charges. The law also regulates the operations of medicinal marijuana plant growers and dispensaries, which are sometimes referred to as “compassion clubs.”That same day, the Legislature enacted a statute banning medical marijuana cultivation centers and dispensaries from making campaign contributions to political committees promoting a candidate for public office. The statue also prohibits political candidates from accepting those donations.Ball and Schluter claimed in their federal lawsuit that the law violates their free-speech rights as well as donors’ political freedom of speech protected under the First Amendment.State officials failed to convince U.S. District Judge John Z. Lee that Illinois has the right to prohibit medical marijuana-related campaign contributions based on its claim that members of the medical cannabis industry hope to get political favors in the form of renewed permits, a limited number of which are issued each year.“Defendants offer no support for their claim that medical cannabis cultivation centers and dispensaries in fact pose a greater risk of corruption than other potential donors, including those subject to similar regulation and licensure requirements,” Judge Lee wrote in a 22-page opinion issued Friday.Lee found that the First Amendment “does not give the government free reign to selectively impose contribution restrictions in a manner that discriminates based on content or viewpoint.”The judge concluded that the state cannot justify banning medical marijuana contributions when more reasonable restrictions are available, such as dollar limits on contributions.He struck down the statute because it places an “unjustifiable burden on the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association.”Courthouse News Service

			MOSUL, Iraq – A mortar believed to be fired by ISIS landed near a Rudaw team embedded with Iraqi forces in Mosul, causing severe respiratory problems among the advancing Iraqi soldiers and media.
The incident happened as Iraqi forces were battling the militant group near Ashur hotel in the center of Mosul, facing ISIS mortar and sniper fire.Rudaw’s camera captured the moment blue-tinged smoke made its way towards a school building where Iraqi forces and Rudaw’s team were stationed.As a thick plume of smoke reaches the Iraqi forces, they start panic and flee the school.“My eyes have gone blind,” Rudaw’s cameraman Sirwan Jalal cries out to reporter Nabard Hussein, both of whom run with the Iraqi forces out of the area.“I am suffocating,” Jalal tells Hussein, asking him not leave him behind. People can be heard coughing and retching.Hussein tells Jalal to hurry up, but Jalal continues to say, “My eyes cannot see.” He asks for water while making their way out.Hussein, who has been covering the war against ISIS for almost three years, said that this mortar attack was different.“There were many instances that mortar and car bombs exploded near us. But this one was so different,” Hussein told Rudaw TV in Erbil after he received treatment at a military hospital in Mosul and then at the Rozhawa hospital in Erbil.“A smoke, which we first thought was a normal fire, after 10 seconds we felt suffocation and tears came out from our eyes and from our nose. Our eyesight went dark. In 10 seconds, I, the force that was there, and my cameraman, as it is seen, all of us pulled back. Some lost consciousness and many experienced vomiting. Our skin was itching. A lot of water came out of our eyes and nose, and our skins felt like burning… you feel your throat is blocked.”“It smelled like hot pepper or onion. A very bad and suffocating smell,” Hussein added.Hussein said that doctors could not immediately confirm what the substance was, but said that he has to go back to the doctor after 24 hours for further medical inspections.He said that Rudaw’s driver, who was at the time about 400 meters away from the incident, also experienced some of these symptoms.Iraq has “no evidence” that ISIS had used chemical weapons in Mosul, the country’s ambassador to the United Nations Mohamed Ali Alhakim told reporters on Friday.Alhakim made the remarks as the UN Security Council was briefed on the situation of Mosul behind the closed doors. He said that he talked to Iraqi officials from Baghdad on Friday midday, and “there was really no evidence that Daesh has used this chemical weapon,” he said using an Arabic name for ISIS.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on March 5 that at least 15 people had been admitted to Rozhawa hospital since March 1 with symptoms indicating they were exposed to toxins from a blistering chemical agent.Blister agents, or vesicants, are one of the most common chemical weapon agents, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).“These oily substances act via inhalation and contact with skin,” the OPCW writes on its website. “They affect the eyes, respiratory tract, and skin, first as an irritant and then as a cell poison. As the name suggests, blister agents cause large and often life-threatening skin blisters which resemble severe burns.”The president of the UN Security Council, currently held by Britain, Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters Friday that Iraq’s investigation into the use of the chemical weapon in Mosul was “ongoing.”“We expressed concern over reports of possible use of chemical weapons by Daesh and we look forward to the results of Iraq’s investigation into those allegations,” Rycroft told reporters after the closed door meeting of the Security Council.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi also denied reports of ISIS using chemical weapons in Mosul. He called the reports “wrong.”“According to our information and our follow up, if ISIS were capable of using chemical weapons, they would have used it,” Abadi said on Wednesday in Sulaimani. “But according to our information, they do not have that capability to use it. And what happened actually is a mixture of smoke and gas, and not a chemical weapon. It has a very limited impact.”ISIS has used chemical weapons on several occasions in the last two years, including against Peshmerga forces, wounding at least 200 Kurdish fighters. The group was developing the weapons in the chemistry labs of Mosul University, Iraq special forces discovered when they retook the campus in eastern Mosul earlier this year.Get the latest geopolitical news, alerts and analysis

If you have ever thanked God for the presence of a CRNA student and their multiple A-line attempts because it gave you time to run upstairs and forage for food in the surgeon’s lounge…If you have mastered the art of the toasted PB&J sandwich with the industrial, finicky, but misunderstood lounge toaster…If you know that changing shoes half-way through a hellish call day makes the world of difference (any shoes… just a new something to torture, cradle your aching feet) …If you know more phone extensions than the hospital operator…If you regularly sweet talk radiology techs and secretaries into making small miracles happen…If the trauma bay is where old running shoes go to retire…If the first order you wrote as a licensed physician was 5-325 Norcos….If you have ever received a consult from MICU on Friday at 4 PM…based on a CT scan ordered at 8 AM….If you’ve ever positioned a patient in lateral decubitus with plenty of pillows… and found yourself wishing for a stack of pillows and a nap…If you have the ability to simultaneously listen and respond to the CRNA muttering about starting pressors, your attending intent on the case, the scrub tech searching for a missing piece of equipment, the circulating RN whispering about a case delay, and the whane beep of an unanswered pager…If you have ever eaten cereal at work after 5 PM…If you have ever walked out to your car after a late day, realized it’s the only one left in the parking deck, and felt like the protagonist in a bad horror movie…If you feel guilty about going home early, even when there is literally nothing to be followed up on or done…If you have ever tried to answer a phantom page…If you ever have found yourself on a patio with an adult beverage and seen a helicopter speeding overhead, and have chuckled and raised your glass to the trauma chief who is definitely NOT YOU tonight….If you have ever planned a weekend off… six weeks ahead of time…And if you found yourself nodding along with all of these…YOU MAY BE A SURGERY RESIDENT!








[3/28/17]  Here’s another reason why you – and your friends and family – should prep:The article linked above ultimately demonstrates one simple concept: If people want something bad enough, they’ll find a way to get it. Armchair liberal academics posing as politicians will always fail to incorporate that concept into their schemes for power.True Americans are a unique bunch of people, and nothing demonstrates that more than the concept of civil disobedience. Left, right or center, it doesn’t matter, Americans are – when it comes down to their heart and soul – individualists. More than anything else, it’s that underlying core of libertarian/anarchy found in Americans, from leftist agitators to the militia members, which vexes the denizens of the United Government of America. Despite a hundred years of indoctrination, the UGA re-education system hasn’t managed to wipe it out completely.That spirit is most apparent in the unique way Americans deal with unpopular regulations and laws. They ignore them or work around them. For example, when slavery was still the law of the land, many Americans formed “underground railroads” to take slaves to places of freedom despite federal law. And when the government tried to prosecute those scofflaws, juries often refused to convict them.We’ve seen this happen over and over in America. Pass a Constitution amendment to prohibit alcohol? Require a nationwide speed limit of 55 miles per hour? Blacklist unacceptable music, books or movies? Require Americans to register or turn in whole groups of “scary” guns? Classify marijuana in the same category as heroin? Tell people they can’t fly an American flag on their own property? Mandate government schools only and bus kids from one neighborhood to another to achieve some kind of ever-changing diversity-derangement standard?Ultimately, the results are the same. The left usually complains about “unjust” laws by marching in the streets and breaking things that don’t belong to them, while the right goes to work to pay for repairing the things the left breaks.But both sides also rebel in a more effective manner: they become outlaws. And when enough of them do so, the UGA – reluctantly – modifies the offending law and then tries to take credit for fixing the problem they created in the first place.Prepping is built on common-law sense and work-arounds.And that’s one of the reasons we prep.Last week’s column focused on the radio system called Family Radio Service, often maligned by the amateur radio mavens as being little more than a toy, and certainly not a part of amateur radio.This week we’ll take a look at another bad boy of the electromagnetic spectrum: the CB (Citizens Band) radio. The development of CB radio as a communication tool is a perfect example of American law-resistance.Much of the following is summarized from Wikipedia: Back in the 1940s and after a bunch of frequency band adjustments, the FCC created a “Citizen’s Band” by peeling off a section of the 11-meter frequency band (previously the purview of licensed amateur radio enthusiasts). The CB band was envisioned to provide families and businesses a short-range communication system consisting of 23 unique channels (increased to 40 channels in 1977). And for years, that’s just what it was used for.








The relentless demonization of Vladimir Putin is just one part of Washington’s multi-pronged strategy to roll-back Russian power in Central Asia and extinguish Putin’s dream of a “Greater Europe”. Along with the attempt to smear the Russian president as a “KGB thug” and “dictator”, the media has also alleged that Moscow intervened in the US presidential elections and that Russia is a serial aggressor that poses a growing threat to European and US national security. The media onslaught, which has greatly intensified since the election of Donald Trump in November 2016, has been accompanied by harsh economic sanctions, asymmetrical attacks on Russia’s markets and currency, the arming and training of Russian adversaries in Ukraine and Syria, the calculated suppression of oil prices, and a heavy-handed effort to sabotage Russia’s business relations in Europe.  In short, Washington is doing everything in its power to prevent Russia and Europe from merging into the world’s biggest free trade zone that will be the center of global growth and prosperity for the next century.This is why the US State Department joined with the CIA to topple the elected government of Ukraine in 2014. Washington hoped that by annexing a vital landbridge between the EU and Asia, US powerbrokers could control critical pipeline corridors that are drawing the two continents closer together into an alliance that will exclude the United States. The prospect of Russia meeting more of the EU’s growing energy needs, while China’s high-speed railway system delivers more low-cost manufactured goods, suggests that the world’s center of economic gravity is shifting fast increasing the probability that the US will continue on its path of irreversible decline. And when the US dollar is inevitably jettisoned as the primary means of exchange between trade partners in the emerging Asia-EU free trade zone, then the recycling of wealth into US debt will drop off precipitously sending US markets plunging while the economy slips into a deep slump. Preventing Putin from “creating a harmonious community of economies from Lisbon to Vladivostok” is no minor hurtle for the United States.  It’s a matter of life and death.Remember the Wolfowitz Doctrine:“Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union. This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power.”Washington’s relations with Russia will always be fractious because Russia poses a perennial threat to US ambitions to rule the world. Geography is fate, and Russia’s geography contains massive oil and gas reserves that Europe needs to heat its homes and fuel its businesses. The symbiotic relationship between supplier and end-user will eventually lead to the lifting of trade barriers, the lowering of tariffs, and the smooth melding together of national economies into a region-wide common market.  This may be Washington’s biggest nightmare, but it’s also Putin’s top strategic priority. Here’s what he said:“We must consider more extensive cooperation in the energy sphere, up to and including the formation of a common European energy complex. The Nord Stream gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea and the South Stream pipeline under the Black Sea are important steps in that direction. These projects have the support of many governments and involve major European energy companies. Once the pipelines start operating at full capacity, Europe will have a reliable and flexible gas-supply system that does not depend on the political whims of any nation. This will strengthen the continent’s energy security not only in form but in substance. This is particularly relevant in the light of the decision of some European states to reduce or renounce nuclear energy.”If Europe wants a reliable partner that can meet its energy needs, then Russia fits the bill.  Unfortunately, the US has repeatedly tried to sabotage both pipelines in order to undermine EU-Russia relations. Washington would prefer that Europe either dramatically curtail its use of natural gas or find other more expensive alternatives that don’t involve Russia. In other words, Europe’s material needs are being sacrificed for Washington’s geopolitical objectives, the primary goal of which is to prevent the forming of Greater Europe.Washington’s war against Russia is becoming increasingly militarized.  Recently the Pentagon deployed more combat troops to Syria and Kuwait suggesting that US warplanners intend to shift from the current strategy of arming jihadist militias (to topple the government of Syrian President Bashar al Assad), to a more direct use of martial force to seize-and-hold territory in East Syria.  There are signs of an uptick in the violence in Ukraine too, as President Trump appears only-too-eager to use a more iron-fisted approach in settling regional disputes than his predecessor, Barack Obama.Also, NATO has deployed troops and weaponry to Russia’s western flank while the US has spread its military bases across Central Asia. NATO has continued to push eastward ever since the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989.  The steady buildup of hostile armies on Russia’s western perimeter has been a source of growing concern in Moscow and for good reason. Russians know their history.At the same time the US is building a ground-based missile defense system in Romania (Star Wars) that integrates the US nuclear arsenal at a site that is just 900 miles from Moscow. The US missile system which was “certified for operation” in May 2016, cancels-out Russia’s nuclear deterrents and destroys the strategic balance of power in Europe.   Putin has responded by ordering appropriate countermeasures.  Here are Putin’s comments on the subject:“It seems that NATO countries, and especially the United States, have developed a peculiar understanding of security which is fundamentally different from our own. The Americans are obsessed with the idea of ‘absolute invulnerability’ for themselves… But absolute invulnerability for one nation means absolute vulnerability for everybody else. We cannot agree to this.”In the last week, the Trump administration announced that it will deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to South Korea citing a need to respond to provocations by North Korea. In truth, Washington is using the North as a pretext for its plan to hem in Russia and China at “axial ends” of the Eurasian heartland as a means of containing the vast landmass that Sir Halford Mackinder called the “pivot area… stretching from the Persian Gulf to China’s Yangtze River.”Washington hopes that by controlling critical sea lanes, encircling the region with military bases, and aggressively inserting itself where necessary, it can prevent the emergence of an economic colossus that will diminish the United States role as global superpower.  America’s future rests on its ability to derail economic integration at the center of the world and prevail in the Great Game where others have failed. Here’s an excerpt from an article by Alfred W. McCoy titled  The Geopolitics of American Global Decline” which helps to shed light on the struggle  that is now taking place for control over the so called “world island”:Following World War II the US became  “the first power in history to control the strategic axial points “at both ends of Eurasia” … With fears of Chinese and Russian expansion serving as the “catalyst for collaboration,” the U.S. won imperial bastions in both Western Europe and Japan. With these axial points as anchors, Washington then built an arc of military bases that followed Britain’s maritime template and were visibly meant to encircle the world island….“Having seized the axial ends of the world island from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945, for the next 70 years the United States relied on ever-thickening layers of military power to contain China and Russia inside that Eurasian heartland. Stripped of its ideological foliage, Washington’s grand strategy of Cold War-era anticommunist “containment” was little more than a process of imperial succession. …By the Cold War’s end in 1990, the encirclement of communist China and Russia required 700 overseas bases, an air force of 1,763 jet fighters, a vast nuclear arsenal, more than 1,000 ballistic missiles, and a navy of 600 ships, including 15 nuclear carrier battle groups — all linked by the world’s only global system of communications satellites….(“The Geopolitics of Global Decline”, Alfred W. McCoy)For the last 70 years the imperial strategy has worked without a hitch, but now Russia’s resurgence and China’s explosive growth are threatening to break free from Washington’s stranglehold. The Asian allies have begun to crisscross Central Asia and Europe with pipelines and high-speed rail that will gather together the far-flung statelets scattered across the steppe, draw them into a Eurasian Economic Union, and link them to an expansive and thriving superstate, the epicenter of global commerce and industry.  Grand Chessboard brain-trust Zbigniew Brzezinski summed up the importance of Central Asia in his 1997 classic stating:“Eurasia is the globe’s largest continent and is geopolitically axial. A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world’s three most advanced and economically productive regions. ….About 75 per cent of the world’s people live in Eurasia, and most of the world’s physical wealth is there as well, both in its enterprises and underneath its soil. Eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the world’s GNP and about three-fourths of the world’s known energy resources.” (The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy And Its Geostrategic Imperatives, Zbigniew Brzezinski, p.31)A new global empire is gradually emerging in Central Asia,  and while the transformative impact of economic integration has not yet been realized, US efforts to block the embryonic alliance are getting weaker and more desperate all the time.  The hyperbolic propaganda about the alleged  “Russia hacking” of the presidential election is just one example of this, while the arming of Nazi militants in Kiev is another.The bottom line is that both Russia and China are using markets, development and raw ingenuity to beat Washington, while Washington relies almost exclusively on deception, covert activity and hard power.  In other words, the former communists are beating the capitalists at their own game. Here’s more from McCoy:“China is reaching deep within the world island in an attempt to thoroughly reshape the geopolitical fundamentals of global power. It is using a subtle strategy that has so far eluded Washington’s power elites….The initial step has involved a breathtaking project to put in place an infrastructure for the continent’s economic integration.  By laying down an elaborate and enormously expensive network of high-speed, high-volume railroads as well as oil and natural gas pipelines across the vast breadth of Eurasia, China may realize Mackinder’s vision in a new way.  For the first time in history, the rapid transcontinental movement of critical cargo — oil, minerals, and manufactured goods — will be possible on a massive scale, thereby potentially unifying that vast landmass into a single economic zone stretching 6,500 miles from Shanghai to Madrid. In this way, the leadership in Beijing hopes to shift the locus of geopolitical power away from the maritime periphery and deep into the continent’s heartland….” (Tomgram: Alfred McCoy, Washington’s Great Game and Why It’s Failing”, TomDispatch)Washington is not going to let the Russo-China plan go forward without a fight. If economic sanctions, covert activity and financial sabotage don’t work, then US powerbrokers will implement more lethal strategies. The recent deployment of troops to the Middle East suggests that policymakers believe that a direct military confrontation might be the best available option, after all, a shooting war with Russia in Syria or Ukraine would not necessarily escalate into a full-blown nuclear conflagration. No one wants that. But if the fighting can be contained within Syria’s borders, then it would be a practical way to rally the EU allies, torpedo Russia’s “economic integration” plan, and draw Moscow into a long, resource-draining quagmire. Is that what US war-planners have in mind?It’s a risky plan, but one that Washington would eagerly pursue if it helped to reinforce America’s global supremacy. MIKE WHITNEY lives in Washington state.

Many an English teacher (and editor) have pushed the importance of a well-placed comma. But, nothing drives the message home as well as a lawsuit that had a considerable financial impact because a Maine law did not use an Oxford comma. A class-action lawsuit decision about overtime pay hinged on the omission of that little piece of punctuation.The so-called Oxford comma is the final one in a list before the last item; for example, she ate chicken, salad, and broccoli. Many publications and the Associated Press (AP) Stylebook rules they follow do not add that punctuation before the and in a list.Guardian Liberty Voice used to leave it out, but recently reinstated its use for clarity reasons. To understand, compare these sentences:The first implies that Trump and Ryan are the favorites. The second one implies they are merely two others who were visited.The LawsuitThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston handed down a decision on Monday, March 13, that cited the missing punctuation in the Maine law as the basis for a judgment that could cost a dairy company approximately $10 million. The court found in O’Connor v. Oakhurst Dairy that the statute did not include the comma, so the meaning was ambiguous. As Judge David Barron noted in his opinion, “For want of a comma, we have this case.”The specific legislation reviewed by the court requires overtime pay, except for those involved in some foodservice activities, including “the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution ….” Three truck drivers sued Oakhurst Dairy on behalf of themselves and other workers for over four years’ of overtime pay that they were denied based on the company’s interpretation of the law. The drivers distribute foods, but do not pack them.The court was asked to decide whether the clause referred to one activity that involves packing or two separate activities—packing and distribution. If distribution is interpreted as a separate activity, the workers would not earn overtime pay. Placing the Oxford comma before the or would have made it clear that distribution was part of the list of exempt activities. There was no comma, per Maine’s legislative drafting instructions.One other grammar lesson involved in the lawsuit dealt with gerunds (the –ing ending on a word). The litigants also pointed out that the other activities were written with a gerund, but distribution was not. They believed that was further evidence that packing and distribution was one activity, since all the other activities in the list had gerunds.The local district court had granted a summary judgment to the dairy company after determining that “distribution” is a stand-alone activity and exempt from overtime pay. The First Circuit reversed that, however. The appeals court, citing the uncertainty caused by the grammar, ruled in the drivers’ favor, granting them the overtime pay.It is not clear if Oakhurst Dairy will try to take the case to a higher court. What is clear is that using or not using the Oxford comma can have a big impact.”By Dyanne WeissSources:

Accuracy in MediaBuzzFeed, described by Wikipedia as “a liberal American internet media company based in New York City,” is in the “donor spotlight” at the national news museum in Washington, D.C., known as the Newseum. The “honor” demonstrates how the media have changed and how low they have sunk.A virtual property of Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, BuzzFeed has been a cog in the anti-Trump media machine.The “donor spotlight” designation is strangely appropriate, since BuzzFeed disclosed the so-called “Trump Dossier” used by the intelligence community to smear President Trump. “The allegations are unverified, and the report contains errors,” the social media site acknowledged while spreading the dubious claims.By contrast, the John Peter Zenger exhibit located in the Newseum highlights a printer whose publication used the weapon of truth. The Newseum tells us, “German immigrant John Peter Zenger became a free-press hero before there was a First Amendment. On Nov. 17, 1734, the newspaper publisher was jailed for printing truthful articles in his New-York Weekly Journal accusing British Colonial governor William Cosby of being corrupt.”The “Trump Dossier” released by BuzzFeed was concocted by a former British intelligence agent, and turned over to James Comey’s FBI. Around that time, in July of 2016, notes columnist Lawrence Sellin, the FBI launched its investigation of the unproven connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Comey told Congress that the Bureau has been actively investigating possible links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin since “late July” of 2016.“What a coincidence,” writes Sellin, a retired colonel with 29 years of service in the U.S. Army Reserve and a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq. This means that “the FBI investigation was based on highly questionable evidence” for which former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele reportedly “paid intermediaries who in turn paid sources for the information he used in the report.” In other words, he says, they were third-hand rumors from unidentified individuals. Sellin adds, “Remarkably, along with Trump’s political opponents, the Obama-Comey FBI planned to pay Steele to continue his work.”The British link is significant. While Fox News commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano has been suspended for suggesting that the British NSA, known as GCHQ, had access to the surveillance information used against Trump, the two organizations do in fact have a history of working closely together.This is shaping up as an example of how the Deep State operates, writes Sellin. In this case, intelligence arrangements are made “that open the possibility for government officials to skirt inconvenient national laws in order to surveil citizens and then use the products of that surveillance for political purposes.”For raising necessary questions about this arrangement, Napolitano was reportedly banned from Fox News. He is the modern-day John Peter Zenger. However, his March 16 column, “Did Obama Spy on Trump?” is still on his website and looks increasingly relevant every day that passes.This has been a major black mark for Fox News. Still, Fox News personalities like Sean Hannity are trying to cover the deepening scandal involving Obama administration surveillance of Trump and his associates.The role that has been played by Comcast and its properties in the anti-Trump campaign is a teachable moment that allows us to reflect on the meaning of the First Amendment and how modern media have left behind the legacy of John Peter Zenger.In contrast to Zenger, who used the weapon of truth against public officials, BuzzFeed used lies that were apparently devised for partisan political purposes by a foreign operative.Referring to Comcast and others, Trump adviser Peter Navarro said during the campaign, “Donald Trump will break up the new media conglomerate oligopolies that have gained enormous control over our information, intrude into our personal lives, and in this election, are attempting to unduly influence America’s political process.”BuzzFeed has been forced to apologize to one of those named in the Trump Dossier, in preparation for a suit filed against them.By contrast, Zenger was found not guilty of seditious libel after his attorney, Alexander Hamilton, said, “It is not the cause of one poor printer, but the cause of liberty.”Rather than being given a distinction as a valued donor, perhaps an exhibit in the Newseum should highlight BuzzFeed as an example of the politically-correct corporate media that today makes a mockery of First Amendment values.At the same time, the Newseum should consider embracing the cause of freeing Judge Napolitano.There’s no money in doing so. It would just be the right thing to do. It would be a reaffirmation of First Amendment values.Cliff Kincaid is the Director of the AIM Center for Investigative Journalism and can be contacted at cliff.kincaid@aim.org.

The current chairman of the armed services committee in the US Senate said that Washington should restore cooperation with the EU — long one of America’s “most important alliances.”The remarks came at the Brussels Forum, a conference organized by the transatlantic think tank German Marshall Fund. The globalist ideologue, who once was a presidential candidate for the Republican Party, has once again put himself in direct opposition to President Trump by saying that it is essential for the allies to develop more connectivity and cooperation.“I trust the EU,” he said, elaborating that EU and NATO were “the best two sums in history” and have maintained global peace for the last 70 years.“We need to rely on NATO and have a NATO that adjusts to new challenges.”Earlier in January the new US President Donald Trump complimented the UK on its “smart” decision to withdraw from the EU and dubbed NATO an “obsolete” coalition.McCain said he supported Trump’s calls on Europe to increase defense spending for NATO, but added that Americans should “also appreciate the fact that over 1,000 young [European] people have given their lives in Afghanistan or Iraq.”“I don’t know what price tag you put on that,” he said. “That’s quite a contribution I would say, if you ask their mothers.”McCain hesitated to prejudge Trump’s presidency based on his first months in office but said that he should fill intelligence gaps and address what the Senator believes was Russia’s attempts to influence the outcome of the US election in November.McCain also accused Russia of trying to influence approaching elections in France and Germany, and the president of Russia Vladimir Putin in particular in trying to restore the Russian empire, despite providing no evidence for those allegations.SOURCE








For the first time in a decade, the death rate in the United States, in 2015, rose according to preliminary data. The increase was due to drug overdose, suicide, Alzheimer’s disease, and heart disease- which had previously been in decline.However, for the last couple of years, death rates had been declining due to, “improvements in health, disease management (but not disease cures- hmmm…) and medical technology”.From the article:“While recent research has documented sharp rises in death rates among certain groups — in particular less educated whites, who have been hardest hit by the prescription drug epidemic — increases for the entire population are relatively rare.Federal researchers cautioned that it was too early to tell whether the rising mortality among whites had pushed up the overall national death rate. (Preliminary data is not broken down by race, and final data will not be out until later this year.) But they said the rise was real, and while it is premature to ring an alarm now, if it continues, it could be a signal of distress in the health of the nation.”Ok, please excuse me but, yes. Duh. We have a problem. We are in distress. Why are they only, MAYBE, just now noticing? No worries though, they will find a drug for that.Statisticians aren’t worried though, and won’t be, unless they see the trend continue into 2016. They are however, “surprised”. I assume it will contine.More from the article:“We are not accustomed to seeing death rates increase on a national scale,” said Andrew Fenelon, a researcher at the C.D.C. who did not work on the paper. “We’ve seen increases in mortality for some groups, but it is quite rare to see it for the whole population.”He added that it would drag the United States further behind its European peers: “Many countries in Europe are witnessing declines in mortality, so the gap between the U.S. and other countries is growing.”And yet, while all of Europe isn’t forcing vaccines on their people, and countries are stepping away from Monsanto and all they represent- we are pushing full steam ahead. It’s honestly only going to get worse here. Way worse before it gets better.I hope that experts will take these rising statistics more seriously and take a hard look at our current health system, which is failing so many of our citizens. However, because we can’t be sure that they will make decisions based on what’s best for public health (they tend to make monetary decisions based on what pharma tells them), we need to be responsible for our own health.I’d love to share my personal health journey with you, click here.Source: NY TimesDisclaimer: This article is not intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.








NEW YORK CITY – Queens based rapper, entrepreneur, and actor Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson has been reportedly shot 9 times again and somehow survived again. Physicians say he is in serious condition and currently being hospitalized.Jackson was shot 9 times Friday morning outside of his $14.5 Million dollar mansion in Farmington, Connecticut in broad daylight. Police say the shooter, identified as 26 year old Eugene Hughes, fled the scene after he shot Jackson but was later caught by Farmington Police after he was found in the backyard of a nearby house apparently on his knees and praying “God please don’t let them catch me, I hate my life enough already” as police tased Hughes and cracked jokes about his prayer as they handcuffed him.It is not the first time Jackson has been a victim of gun violence. Jackson was also shot 9 times at close range back in May of 2000 in his hometown of South Jamaica, Queens. Jackson also appears to have natural body armor built into the inner layers of skin which explains his ability to survive gunshot wounds.Rapper and friend of Jackson, DJ Whoo Kid, told reporters: “Man, 50 is just too hood for his own good, wait that rhymes! that’ll be a good song right? but anyways yeah, 50 was maybe better off resting in peace, I hate to see him suffer like this”. Family and friends of Jackson have been already been seen visiting Jackson at the hospital where he is being treated.Gunman Eugene Hughes is facing charges on attempted murder, AND the “attempted murder of Curtis Jackson”, which has been introduced as a new offense simply because Jackson has been shot “Too many times that it is now a worse crime to shoot Jackson than any other human being”. Hughes is expected to appear in court sometime in March and if found guilty, can serve up to 40 years in federal prison.Visit Huzlers.com regularly for more info on Jackson and other shocking news.

Parade floats in both Germany and New Orleans, Louisiana, couldn’t resist poking fun of America’s thin-skinned President Donald Trump. However, this year both annual celebrations took their trollery to the next level particularly with two floats in Germany (one of which would have warranted a visit from the Secret Service had it been in the U.S.).At Monday’s Rose Parade in Germany, they focused a lot on last year’s Brexit vote, connecting Trump with unpopular European leaders who campaigned for Great Britain’s exit from the European Union. One float featured Trump, Right-wing French politician Marine Le Pen, Dutch anti-immigrant politician Geert Wilder, and a blonde Adolf Hitler.Image via (Photo by Lukas Schulze/Getty Images)Trump’s Russian connections was a featured theme in both New Orleans and Germany, with one float depicting Trump taking instruction in a classroom setting from Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the float, Trump appears to be dragging a woman by the hair (maybe Hillary Clinton, but most likely a European politician) and reaching under the statue of liberty’s dress.Image via (Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images)Image via (Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images)Another uber-bizarre German float features Trump as a half Trump half elephant hybrid wearing a U.S. Flag cape while trampling through a china shop.Featured image (Photo by Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images)Not all of Germany’s floats featured light-hearted humor. The two floats that drew the most attention both featured a battered Statue of Liberty with a bruised eye. On one float Lady Liberty was on all fours with Trump thrusting behind her. The other float featured the statue triumphantly holding Trump’s bloody severed head with the slogan “America Resist!” written across her gown.Image via (Photo by Lukas Schulze/Getty Images)Image via (Photo by Lukas Schulze/Getty Images)Here are some videos featuring the floats in both New Orleans and Germany.Humor, even dark humor, can be an effective tool to fight the anger and sense of helplessness many people still feel after 2016’s disastrous election. While Trump supporters still pat themselves on the back, Trump has been busy undermining national security, eliminating health care for millions of Americans, and waging war on immigrants. The consequences of 2016’s election are deadly serious. However, Americans and people around the world are coming together in unity to resist Trump’s assault on civilization.It will be interesting to see Trump’s reaction to these parades; it’s likely he won’t find them nearly as amusing as most of the world did. Never the less, America’s #1 Snowflake-in-Chief had better buckle up for at least four years of global mockery before America decides to the resident con artist out of their White House.

Since becoming President, the world has been analysing Donald Trump’s every move, searching for any clues about his personal life and what on earth is going on behind the White House walls.One of the most puzzling things about the President is his unconventional relationship with his wife of 12 years, Melania Trump, who looked visibly unhappy at her husband’s inauguration and has attended surprisingly few engagements since his election.Despite usually focusing on Donald Trump quotes, the whole world has instead been examining the couple’s body language over the past few months, with Trump appearing to avoid holding hands in public with the former Slovenian model, something that body language expert Patti Wood has described as very telling of their relationship. According to her, it’s all down to Trump wanting to be seen as an alpha male and leader, rather than as part of a unit.

The same reasoning could explain the new updates emerging on the First Couple’s relationship, with Donald Trump and Melania reportedly sleeping in separate beds.Of course the couple are currently living miles from each other, with Melania opting against moving to Washington with her husband, instead choosing to stay in New York with her son Barron so that he can finish his school year there – a controversial decision that isn’t customary for the First Family and has been frowned upon by traditionalists.It has been suggested, however, that even when the couple ultimately live in the same place – presumably the White House, they will share a bedroom but sleep in separate beds.A source told Us Weekly that ‘it’s very “royal” of them’, alleging that the couple’s relationship has deteriorated since Trump became President, going on to explain that Melania feels ‘trapped’ in her new role.‘She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him’, another source reportedly told the magazine.








Donald Trump and Paul Ryan agreed to meet next week, but the presumptive Republican presidential nominee doesn’t seem particularly enthusiastic and spoke about going “our separate ways” from the House Speaker.Trump said he told Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus that Ryan’s comments in refusing to endorse him were “totally inappropriate,” but he agreed to the party leader’s desire for a meeting.“Reince feels, and I’m okay with that, that we should meet before we go our separate ways,” Trump said in a statement to The Washington Post. “So I guess the meeting will take place and who knows what will happen.”Ryan announced Friday that he and other members of the House Republican leadership will meet Thursday morning with Trump, a schedule update that came a day after the House Speaker said he is not yet ready to endorse the presumptive nominee.The goal is “to begin a discussion about the kind of Republican principles and ideas that can win the support of the American people this November,” said a statement from Ryan’s political office.Ryan and Trump also agreed to meet separately with Priebus.The announcement came just hours after Trump told a talk show that he was surprised by Ryan’s reticence to support him.The refusal is “not a good thing” and “something the party should get solved quickly,” Trump said Friday on Fox & Friends, adding that he was surprised by the speaker’s comments.“I mean, he talks about unity, but what is this about unity?” Trump said. “With millions of people coming into the party, obviously I’m saying the right thing.”Ryan said Thursday he is not prepared to endorse Trump because of questions about his commitment to conservatism.While Ryan said he wants to back Trump, the House speaker told CNN he wants to make sure that the New York businessman runs “a principled campaign that Republicans can be proud about, and that can actually appeal to a majority of Americans.”Trump responded with a statement saying he is not prepared to back Ryan’s agenda.“Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people,” Trump said.The businessman-turned-presidential-candidate also had a tart message for Ryan on Twitter Friday: “Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn’t inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!”








New figures prove that the viewing audience for mainstream legacy media TV channels is literally dying, underscoring why the establishment is turning to censorship in a bid to strangle its competition.“The extent to which the mainstream media’s influence is dwindling has been highlighted by new figures that show the average BBC 1 viewer is now aged 61, 62 for BBC 2, 60 for ITV, 58 for Channel 5 and 55 for Channel 4. The average viewer for C4’s supposedly hip sister channel is a hardly junior 42,” reports Westmonster.The figures, reported by the Guardian, show that those aged 55 and over spend more than double the time (25 hours) listening to or watching the BBC than young people aged 16 to 34 (11 hours).The results are similar when it comes to the average age of news channels in the United States. The average CNN median primetime viewer is aged 59, while the average Fox News viewer in the same slot is aged 68. Both of these numbers fall outside of the advertiser-coveted 24-54 age demographic.The numbers emphasize how new media is biting huge chunks out of the mainstream media’s audience share thanks to more dynamic, controversial, interesting and on-demand content.This is not a slight against people in their 60’s or above, it’s an insight into how the establishment media is completely failing to attract a new audience, who are increasingly turning to YouTube to get their entertainment and politics fix instead.Polls also illustrate how the mainstream media is losing trust amongst all age groups, but particularly young people.Generation Z (people born from the mid-1990’s to the early 2000’s) is more conservative than any generation since World War 2, and that explains why, as even VICE admits, the right is dominating YouTube.The establishment media is so terrified, not just of conservative voices on YouTube, but of any independent creator with a huge audience of engaged young people – that they are now working with giant corporations to try to financially target and ultimately silence those voices.Instead of competing on a level playing field in a truly egalitarian, capitalist system and allowing those with the better arguments that resonate with the most people to win, the establishment has embarked on a dirty tricks campaign to slander, economically cripple and censor its adversaries.SUBSCRIBE on YouTube: Follow on Twitter: Follow @PrisonPlanet Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.










President-elect Donald Trump’s private business is being turned over to his three eldest children, who are separately serving on his transition team.A statement from the organization released to Reuters says that Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump will run their father’s company with other executives.“This is a top priority at the organization and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations,” the statement read.Trump has long said he would put his assets into a blind trust if elected to avoid conflicts of interests between his business dealings and his decisions as president.But with his children at the helm of the company, Trump’s interests won’t entirely be divorced from the company, something Trump lawyer Michael Cohen downplayed Thursday in an interview with CNN.“Will we be able to appease everybody? The answer is no. No matter what the man does he can’t appease everyone,” he said.“But everything will be done legally. He’s not interested in the company anymore.”Trump’s transition office announced Friday that the three children will be part of the team’s executive committee, as will Ivanka Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner. source








Former California governor and “Apprentice” host Arnold Schwarzenegger is reportedly considering running for Senate in 2018 as a third-party candidate.Schwarzenegger’s spokesman Daniel Ketchell told Politico Thursday the actor isn’t ruling out a run.“Right now Gov. Schwarzenegger’s focus is on using his platform to bring some sensibility and coherency to Washington by fighting for redistricting reform, like we did in California,” Ketchell said. “We are keeping all of our options open as far as how we can accomplish that.”According to the report, California political insiders are buzzing over a possible Schwarzenegger Senate run and say it’s a real possibility.A former GOP political consultant, Luis Alvarado, told Politico it’s good timing for Schwarzenegger to return to politics.“In politics after Donald Trump, nothing is crazy any longer. We’re in the third dimension here,’’ he said. “Arnold Schwarzenegger, who actually has more political experience than Trump, would certainly seem to fit a mold to what some of the electorate would find attractive.”In 2018, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein will be 85 and up for reelection.As a senator, Schwarzenegger could take his feud with President Trump to the Capitol. The two have hit back and forth at each other over policy, as well as “Celebrity Apprentice,” on which Trump was still credited as executive producer while Schwarzenegger hosted the latest season.Most recently, the two fired back at one another over Twitter after Schwarzenegger said he was quitting the show.“Arnold Schwarzenegger isn’t voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me.

We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.—Donald Trump, The America We Deserve (2000)The new American Health Care Act has been unveiled, and it has been pronounced an even greater disaster than Obamacare. Dubbed “Ryancare” or “Trumpcare” (over the objection of White House staff), the Republican health care bill is under attack from all sides, with even conservative leaders calling it “Obamacare Lite,” “bad policy,” a “warmed-over substitute,” and “dead on arrival.”The problem with both bills is that they are trying to fund a bloated, inefficient, and overpriced medical system with dwindling taxpayer funds, without capping its costs. US healthcare costs in 2016 averaged $10,345 per person, for a total of $3.35 trillion dollars, a full 18 percent of the entire economy, twice as much as in other industrialized countries.Ross Perot, who ran for president in 1992, had the right idea: he said all we have to do is to look at other countries that have better health care at lower cost and copy them.So which industrialized countries do it better than the US? The answer is, all of them. They all not only provide healthcare for the entire population at about half the cost, but they get better health outcomes than in the US. Their citizens have longer lifespans, fewer infant mortalities and less chronic disease.President Trump, who is all about getting the most bang for the buck, should love that.Hard to argue with successThe secret to the success of these more efficient systems is that they control medical costs. According to T. R. Reid in The Healing of America, they follow one of three models: the “Bismarck model” established in Germany, in which health providers and insurers are private but insurers are not allowed to make a profit; the “Beveridge model” adopted in Britain, where most healthcare providers work as government employees and the government acts as the single payer for all health services; and the Canadian model, which is a single-payer system but the healthcare providers are mostly private.A single government payer can negotiate much lower drug prices—about half what we pay in the US—and lower hospital prices. Single-payer is also much easier to administer. Cutting out the paperwork can save 30 percent on the cost of insurance. According to a May 2016 post by Physicians for a National Health Program:Per capita, the U.S. spends three times as much for health care as the U.K., whose taxpayer-funded National Health Service provides health care to citizens without additional charges or co-pays. In 2013, U.S. taxpayers footed the bill for 64.3 percent of U.S. health care—about $1.9 trillion. Yet in the U.S. nearly 30 million of our citizens still lack any form of insurance coverage.The for-profit U.S. health care system is corrupt, dysfunctional and deadly. In Canada, only 1.5 percent of health care costs are devoted to administration of its single-payer system. In the U.S., 31 percent of health care expenditures flow to the private insurance industry. Americans pay far more for prescription drugs. Last year, CNN reported, Americans paid nearly 10 times as much for prescription Nexium as it cost in the Netherlands.Single payer, or Medicare for All, is the system proposed in 2016 by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. It is also the system endorsed by Donald Trump in his book The America We Deserve. Mr. Trump confirmed his admiration for that approach in January 2015, when he said on David Letterman:A friend of mine was in Scotland recently. He got very, very sick. They took him by ambulance and he was there for four days. He was really in trouble, and they released him and he said, ‘Where do I pay?’ And they said, ‘There’s no charge.’ Not only that, he said it was like great doctors, great care. I mean we could have a great system in this country.Despite what you may have heard in the presidential debates, the single-payer plan of Bernie Sanders would not have bankrupted the government. To the contrary, according to research by University of Massachusetts Amherst Professor Gerald Friedman, it would have generated substantial savings:Under the single-payer system envisioned by “The Expanded & Improved Medicare For All Act” (H.R. 676), the U.S. could save $592 billion—$476 billion by eliminating administrative waste associated with the private insurance industry and $116 billion by reducing drug prices. . . .According to OECD health data, in 2013 the British were getting their healthcare for $3,364 per capita annually; the Germans for $4,920; the French for $4,361; and the Japanese for $3,713. The tab for Americans was $9,086, at least double the others. With single-payer at the OECD average of $3,661 and a population of 322 million, we should be able to cover all our healthcare for under $1.2 trillion annually—well under half what we are paying now.That is true in theory; but governments at all levels in the US already spend $1.6 trillion for healthcare, which goes mainly to Medicare and Medicaid and covers only 17 percent of the population. Where is the discrepancy?For one thing, Medicare and Medicaid could be had for less than we are paying now. Our single-payer plans are more expensive than in other countries, because the US government has been prevented from negotiating drug and hospital costs to the extent done elsewhere. In January, a bill put forth by Sen. Sanders to allow the importation of cheaper prescription drugs from Canada was voted down. Sanders is now planning to introduce a bill to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, for which he is hoping for the support of the president. Trump indicated throughout his presidential campaign that he would support that approach, and said in January that the pharmaceutical industry is “getting away with murder” because of what it charges the government.Medicare costs are also higher than in single-payer countries because we use more medical technology, including more expensive diagnostic equipment. Tests must be run to recoup those costs, whether or not the patients really need them.Why is our collective health worse than in other countries?Drug and technology costs aside, the US tab seems to be higher than elsewhere just because Americans are sicker than people in other industrialized countries. We have shorter life spans and more chronic disease, despite the most expensive healthcare in the world. Forty-eight percent of U.S. men and 38% of women can now look forward to getting cancer. A third of American children suffer from chronic disease, eight percent suffer from serious food allergies, 10% from asthma, 17% are diagnosed with learning or behavior disabilities, almost 2% from autism, and a third of low-income preschool kids are already overweight or obese. Heart disease, diabetes, mental illness, cancer, and obesity rates are sharply up in all sectors of the population. What is making us so unhealthy?It’s not smoking. People in other industrialized countries actually smoke more than Americans. In fact the Japanese, with the highest life expectancy among industrialized countries, smoke 75 percent more cigarettes than people in the US.It is also not lack of exercise. People in most industrialized countries are more sedentary than people in the US. Nor does it appear to be our stress levels, which are not much different from those in other comparable countries.There are, however, several variables in which we easily outdistance every other industrialized nation. We eat more genetically modified (GMO) foods, we give more and stronger vaccines to children, and we have far more obesity. More than a third of adults in the U.S. were obese in 2012. Out-of-control obesity levels appear to be a function of the deficient American diet. Not getting the nutrients we need from our over-processed, microwaved, genetically-modified, glyphosate-laden “fast food” and “junk food,” Americans are constantly hungry. Hormones given to livestock to fatten them are also making people fatter.Another suspicious variable is the American healthcare system itself. US medical care is all about treating symptoms rather than the underlying causes of chronically poor health. There is little profit to be extracted from quick, effective cures. The money is in the drugs that have to be taken for 30 years, killing us slowly. And they are killing us. Pharmaceutical drugs taken as prescribed are the fourth leading cause of US deaths, after heart disease, cancer and stroke.Lured by drug advertising, Americans are popping pills they don’t need, with side effects that are creating problems where none existed before. The US is the only industrialized country besides New Zealand that allows drug companies to advertise pharmaceuticals. Big Pharma spends more on lobbying than any other US industry, and it spends more than $5 billion a year on advertising. Although Americans comprise only 5 percent of the world’s population, we consume fully 50 percent of Big Pharma’s drugs and 80 percent of the world’s pain pills. We not only take more drugs (measured in grams of active ingredient) than people in most other countries, but we have the highest use of new prescription drugs, which have a 1 in 5 chance of causing serious adverse reactions after they have been approved.The death toll from prescription drugs is 128,000 Americans per year. As Jon Rappaport observes, with those results Big Pharma should be under criminal investigation. But the legal drug industry has grown too powerful for that. According to Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, writing in 2002:The combined profits for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 ($35.9 billion) were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put together ($33.7 billion). Over the past two decades the pharmaceutical industry has [become] a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit, [using] its wealth and power to co-opt every institution that might stand in its way, including the US Congress, the FDA, academic medical centers, and the medical profession itself.Drug companies are driven by profit, and their market is sickness—a market they have little incentive to shrink. As observed by Ronnie Cummins, International Director of the Organic Consumers Association, in February 2017:. . . [B]ig pharmaceutical companies, for-profit hospitals and health insurers are allowed to jack up their profit margins at will. . . . Simply giving everyone access to Big Pharma’s overpriced drugs, and corporate hospitals’ profit-at-any-cost tests and treatment, will result in little more than soaring healthcare costs, with uninsured and insured alike remaining sick or becoming even sicker.US healthcare costs are projected to grow at 6 percent a year over the next decade. The result could be to bankrupt not only millions of consumers but the entire federal government. Obamacare has not worked, and Ryancare is not likely to work. As demonstrated in many other industrialized countries, single-payer delivers better health care at half the cost that Americans are paying now.Winston Churchill is said to have quipped, “You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing after they have tried everything else.” We need to try a thrifty version of Medicare for All, with negotiated prices for drugs, hospitals and diagnostic equipment.

I serve on the Board of Directors of a large Singapore-based company that’s in the gold and silver business.And, last night during our quarterly conference call, the management team gave me a lot of intriguing information.Sales of physical gold and silver are collapsing across the entire industry.At the US Mint, for example, sales of US Eagle gold coins fell by 67% between February 2016 versus February 2017.And sales of US Eagle silver coins are down 75% over the same period.The World Gold Council’s data also shows a substantial decline in physical precious metal demand in 2016, particularly with bars, coins, and jewelry.Suppliers and refiners in the precious metals business are echoing these numbers, lamenting that sales are extremely slow and margins are falling.For our Singapore company, this decline is irrelevant.They have their own proprietary, state-of-the-art storage facility and a number of cutting-edge service like bullion-backed peer-to-peer loans, so business is great.But I would expect that a number of other bullion dealers will probably go bust if this downturn lasts much longer.The one conundrum is that this trend does NOT correlate with the price of gold.In US dollar terms, the gold price is up 16% since the beginning of 2016.So it would be reasonable to conclude that sales of physical bars and coins are up as well.But they’re not.The reason is because there’s a HUGE difference between physical gold and “paper” gold.When people talk about the gold price, they’re really quoting the price of gold contracts at exchanges around the world in London, Shanghai, Chicago, etc.Traders aren’t actually buying and selling physical gold.These gold contracts are merely paper financial instruments, like stocks and bonds, that traders use for speculation.When some conflict breaks out in Africa, the knee-jerk reaction is for traders to buy gold contracts.And when central bankers announce that the economy is totally awesome, traders dutifully dump their gold contracts.But they’re really just buying and selling highly leveraged paper assets. Nothing physical changes hands.It’s the same with gold ETFs; these are merely financial instruments to gamble on the paper price of gold.Investors who truly understand the benefits of owning gold, and don’t simply want to speculate on the price, buy physical bars and coins from a dealer.And quite often there’s a massive difference in fundamentals between the demand for physical coins and the paper price.During the 2008 financial meltdown, the paper price of gold and silver plunged.Speculators and traders were hit by margin calls and forced to sell their contracts.But demand for physical coins was incredibly strong; savvy investors were looking for a safe haven.There was a total disconnect between the paper price and physical demand.That’s now happening again, but in reverse. The paper price is rising, but physical demand is falling.Management told me last night that they’ve been invited to speak at several investment conferences attended by family offices and high net worth individuals.But they told me that there’s very little interest in owning physical precious metals among these wealthy investors.Everyone seems to want to dump all of their money in US stocks or real estate, expecting that they’ll easily make 20% despite both markets being at all-time highs.This strikes me as total madness. Few people ever prospered buying what was popular and expensive.There seems to be no fear in the market… no regard for sense or safety.And my contrarian instincts tell me that this complacency is a great reason to own physical gold and silver right now.Remember that gold is primarily a form of savings.You could hold your savings in a bank account, denominated in paper currency like dollars or euros or renminbi.Or you could hold savings in physical cash. You could even own government bonds.Each of these is a form of savings.But so is gold and silver. (And cryptocurrency, for that matter.)The difference is that gold and silver cannot be conjured out of thin air by a central bank.And unlike cash, or money in a bank, precious metals actually keep pace with inflation over time.I remember having a conversation once with a famous investor who told me that he didn’t know what was going to happen in the future…… and THAT’S why he owned gold– for the “I don’t knows.”Will there be a trade war with China in the next few years? A shooting war? A major debt crisis? Another terrorist attack? “I don’t know.”Gold and silver are fantastic insurance policies against the “I don’t knows” due to the metals’ 5,000 year history of value and marketability.There’s no need to go overboard and keep 100% of your net worth in precious metals.But given the obvious risks on the horizon that we discuss regularly, and these bizarre demand trends, it’s a great time to consider adding to your physical precious metals savings.

We’ve all heard about flat earth theory. (If you haven’t you should probably go read a book or something.) It’s the idea that the planet is actually “flat” (spoilers). But none of us have really paid it much mind, because as we all know, Columbus kind of blew that theory out of the water the day he sailed to the west, and TOTALLY got to the east.. Right? Wrong. In a recent slip-up by a global space agency, we have finally learned the truth: The world is flat and school is pointless. Granted, we’ve all known that second one was true, but now we have concrete evidence that supports the world being flat. It all happened on a cold January day, also known as “last Wednesday”. During their earth-shattering presentation about how alien life has been discovered on a distance planet, one of the space analysts actually said everything needed to prove the theory. Here’s the direct quote:“Our last mission was as successful as any ever has been. After our initial contact with the alien species, they appear to be friendly, and willing to discuss our technological advances. Our slingshot launch using the earths gravity was tremendously effective, much to the chagrin of some of our critics. I mean, everyone knows the earth is flat, right? [audible laughter]”There you go. Finally proof. The world is flat, and that scientist just confirmed it. We can only assume the rest of the people in the room start laughing as a show that they are also a part of the conspiracy. Well, the jokes on them, because this was being TELEVISED ON LIVE TELEVISION!Another interview, this time with one of the aliens, we get the following quote that confirms the earlier quote:“Hello humans, thank you for taking the time to build cities and structures on this puny planet. We will take it from here. At first we were shocked to learn you were more than just simple animals, with what pathetic attempts you’ve made into space travel. Your earth might as well be flat for all the –”That’s really the only important part of that quote… But you see it there at the end again, “Earth might as well be flat”, straight from the lips of a space traveller who has seen the earth from “space”. Granted, that alien may not be entirely trustworthy, since he is a minority, but let’s not dwell on that fact just now. We’ve now heard the fact that the earth is flat from two separate sources. It’s only a matter of time before we hear it officially, since they have to figure out it’s out before too long. We can’t be the only ones who heard it, right..?UPDATE:A man who was recently abducted by our alien overlords just gave a press interview detailing his experience. I think you’ll find it interesting how he described our beautiful flat Earth…“There I was, getting sucked up into the alien spacecraft. At first I fought it, but soon I couldn’t feel my limbs, so I just gave in and let them suck me into the little pod thing. Immediately upon entering everything was completely dark, then suddenly there was a loud ‘wooshing’ noise, and I could feel gravity lessening. Suddenly, a window popped open, which I think was to let them check that I was still in there, and I could see Earth below, nothing more than the size of a nickel. That’s when the probing started…”A nickel! And what are nickels!? FLAT. That’s right, nickels are flat. Flat Earth proven. Eat your heart out unbelievers.

Home › Main Forums › Latest Breaking News › Seattle Files Lawsuit Over ‘Sanctuary Cities’ Funding ThreatThe city of Seattle on Wednesday announced a federal lawsuit over the Trump administration’s threat to withhold federal grants to so-called “sanctuary cities,” citing the 10th Amendment that deals with states’ rights.“Apparently the Trump administration, their war on facts, has now become a war on cities,” Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said. He said the goal of the suit is to have a judge declare the order unconstitutional. http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/seattle-files-lawsuit-over-sanctuary-cities-funding-threat-n740331You must be logged in to reply to this topic.If Trump’s administration are selectively going after cities and states locally that are sanctuary cities and taking away federal funding from them, then these cities and their states should consider raising taxes on companies still owned by Trump or his extended family, as a way of saying that if he still has conflicting financial interests, those companies depending on his investment money should have to bear the costs of the added costs that are pushed on to the state for the funding burdens that Trump wants to put on them.Perhaps Trump will have to further divest himself from these companies to stop that part of it as he should anyway, or pull back on these threatening sanctions which could perhaps have localities pull back from doing this sort of taxation.And I think coupled with that Democrats should solidify the filibuster of Gorsuch’s nomination, to keep the court divided for some time now, which will allow the “virtual” supreme courts that aren’t divided in different regions reject court cases that Trump might bring against this sort of taxation if they are more controlled by liberal factions in those regions.  Would perhaps us solidify a filibuster by states and cities announcing they are doing this now.

In the recent years, the Arab Republic of Egypt, one of the most developed Arab countries, has gone through difficult times. In addition to the political instability, Egypt has encountered an energy crisis that had grave consequences for all sectors of the country’s economy. Nevertheless, the country continues remedying the ramifications of the crisis. Supported by its long-standing partner, the Russian Federation, Egypt is striving to become a regional energy leader.A lion’s share of the Egyptian energy is produced from natural gas and oil products. A shortage of these fossils causes a disrupted supply of energy. In 2014, Egypt sustained one of the most severe energy crisis in the past few decades, which affected both country’s residents and large enterprises, where the latter suffered massive losses. The crisis was so deep that in September 2014, after an accident that had plunged Cairo in complete darkness, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued a statement saying that the shortage of power was threatening the very existence of the state. He emphasized that the adverse circumstances had been triggered by a long-term underfinancing of the country’s power production industry. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi also noted that the Egyptian power sector was in need of $12 billion investment.After the incident, the Egyptian government stepped up its efforts to improve energy security. A plan envisaging a reconstruction, modernization and development of the entire energy sector, as well as diversification of energy sources was enacted. Egypt chose to advance the production of both traditional (hydrocarbon-based) and alternative sources of energy (solar, wind, etc.).The Egyptian nuclear program also received a new impetus. At that time, the country began looking for foreign and private investors. In 2014, Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy Mohamed Shaker announced that the Egyptian leadership had set the development of the country’s energy sector as its main priority. Today, the country is increasing the amount of investment in the development of its power sector. In November 2016, the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy announced the allocation of $1.2 billion toward the overhaul of the country’s systems of energy transportation and marketing. Egypt has also committed to the increase of its annual investment in the development of the energy sector to $130 billion by 2030.However, Egypt, like many other countries of the region, is cautious to rely solely on its own capacities in the matter of energy security. Therefore, it is looking to integrate its energy production network with the networks of neighboring countries to ensure that in case of emergency it would have access to backup power sources. This strategy has been adopted by many states across the globe. The creation of “energy pools” allows participating countries to help each other whenever their own electricity production fails. Pool participants can also sell electricity produced in excess, thus improving the quality of energy resource management and leveraging the power grid load. By today, Egypt has already formed energy coalitions with Jordan and Libya. In the near future other countries of the Arab Maghreb Union (which includes Libya, Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia), as well as Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, might join in.The most desirable project, however, will be the interconnection of Egyptian and Saudi Arabian energy complexes. Saudi Arabia, being one of the richest Arab countries, is also actively developing its energy sector, including the nuclear and solar power production. Another advantage—by integrating with the Saudi Arabian grid, Egypt would gain access to the power systems of other countries of the Persian Gulf. Since Egypt and Saudi Arabia are separated by an extension of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba, they have to run a seabed cable to connect their power grids. The project was launched in 2015. A test run is scheduled for the summer of 2017.Early this February, Egypt, Greece and Cyprus signed a memorandum of understanding under which the three countries would map out a plan on the pooling of their energy systems. The memorandum was signed by the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company and the Cyprian Euro Africa. The participants are planning to connect the Egypt’s power system with the networks of Greece and Cyprus via the Greek island of Crete. To achieve this goal, a seabed cable would be laid across the Mediterranean Sea. According to the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy of Egypt, this is only a part of a larger energy cooperation project engaging European and African countries. According to the Egyptian Minister of Energy Mohamed Shaker, in the next 1.5 years, the parties to the memorandum would produce a feasibility study, calculate the cost of the project and map out an environmental protection plan.However, resolution of the energy crisis is just a part of the Egypt’s strategy. The country has long been cherishing the idea of becoming a major regional energy center. This is yet another reason why Egypt is seeking to interconnect its power grid with its North African, Mediterranean and Arabic neighbours. The Egyptian leadership expects that a successful implementation of this strategy would allow the country to assume the role of a key mediator of energy exchange between African, European and Middle Eastern countries, boosting the country’s energy security, its economic well-being and international prestige. And Egypt’s geographic location is conducive to the achievement of this goal.However, it would take much more than mere integration of power grids for Egypt to transform into a major Middle Eastern and North African energy hub. Egypt must first scale up its production of electricity so that it can meet its own energy needs and share the surplus with the partners. And Russia might come in handy for Egypt to attain its goal. In November 2015, Russia and Egypt signed an agreement on the construction of the first nuclear power plant near the Egyptian town of El Dabaa. All the documents required to launch the project’s works should be executed within the first six months of 2017. It is clear that by becoming the first country-producer of nuclear power in North Africa, and one of the first in the Middle East, Egypt would increase its chances for becoming a regional energy leader. However, one NPP might not be sufficient. Prior to the political upheaval of 2011, which restrained the implementation of the Egyptian nuclear program, the country had been planning to build between 5 and 8 NPPs. It is quite possible, though, that the Egyptian leadership will reconsider its old plans.After all, the creation of an energy pool interconnecting the entire Middle East and North Africa would undoubtedly contribute to the economic prosperity of this vulnerable region, thus contributing to the stabilization of the overall situation in the region.Dmitry Bokarev, expert politologist, exclusively for the online magazine “New Eastern Outlook“

Dr. Faber was born in Zurich and schooled in Geneva, Switzerland, he studied Economics at the University of Zurich and obtained a Ph.D. in Economics magna cum laude. Marc currently resides in Thailand and works in Hong Kong.THE GLOOM, BOOM & DOOM REPORT – The GBD Report is an in depth economic and financial publication, which highlights unusual investment opportunities around the world. The guiding philosophy is that, as Horace already observed, “many shall be restored that are now fallen and many shall fall that are now in honor.” The Gloom Boom & Doom report aims, based on economic, social and historical trends, to warn investors when investment themes have become widely accepted and are, therefore, highly priced and risky, while it continuously searches for opportunities in unloved and depressed markets. Subscribers to the GBD report are usually institutional investors, corporations or high net worth individuals, who are in a position to invest internationally and in all asset classes including bonds, equities, commodities and real estate, and have the necessary account facilities in place to do so.
The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report is paper based and not available in electronic or email format. WHAT IS THE MONTHLY MARKET COMMENTARY? – Monthly Market Commentaries (MMC) are short commentaries, which largely summarize the views expressed in The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report and are designed for sophisticated individual investors wishing to capitalize on short to medium term asset market moves.The Monthly Market Commentary is an Internet based subscription (delivery and payment). The reports are posted on the gloomboomdoom.com website (subscribers only section) and emailed to all subscribers in PDF format around the 1st of each month.Dr. Marc Faber: Editor & Publisher of the Gloom Boom & Doom Report – Dr Marc Faber was born in Zurich, Switzerland. He went to school in Geneva and Zurich and finished high school with the Matura. He studied Economics at the University of Zurich and, at the age of 24, obtained a PhD in Economics magna cum laude.Between 1970 and 1978, Dr Faber worked for White Weld & Company Limited in New York, Zurich and Hong Kong.

Dr. Faber is also a regular contributor to several leading financial publications around the world.A book on Dr Faber, “RIDING THE MILLENNIAL STORM”, by Nuri Vittachi, was published in 1998.A regular speaker at various investment seminars, Dr Faber is well known for his “contrarian” investment approach. He is also associated with a variety of funds and is a member of the Board of Directors of numerous companies.DR. DOOM – Marc Faber is a contrarian. To be a good contrarian, you need to know what you are contrary about. It helps to be a worldclass economist-historian, to have been a trader and Managing Director of Drexel Burnham Lambert when the firm was the junk bond king of Wall Street, to have lived in Hong Kong for a quarter of a century, and to have a contact book crammed with the home numbers of many of the movers and shakers in the financial world.

In 1987 he warned his clients to cash out before Black Monday in Wall Street; he made them handsome profits by forecasting the burst in the Japanese Bubble in 1990; he correctly predicted the collapse in US gaming stocks in 1993; and he foresaw the AsiaPacific financial crisis of 1997/98 and the resulting global volatility.Nury Vittachi writes in “Riding the Millennial Storm”: Faber has style. A ski racer in his youth, he remains a flamboyant character. He plays to the press, who call him Dr Doom; his monthy newsletter, always an excellent read, is called ‘The Gloom, Boom and Doom Report’. He wears a ponytail, in defiance of the expectation (in Asia, especially) that investment managers should look conventional. His book, The Great Money Illusion, written in a hurry after the 1987 crash, was dedicated “to many beautiful and kind women whose names are better kept confidential”.His office is eclectic. Nineteenthcentury oil paintings of Hong Kong and Macau, mingle with Korean paintings, an amazing collection of Mao memorabilia (including one white alabaster statue with a red scarf tied round its neck), an ancient horned gramophone with old Chinese records, soft flufly yellow toys and a china polar bear, bottles of XO brandy and cases of Grolsch beer. He has a superb library of first editions of works on economics and stockmarket cycles in a variety of European languages, being a multilingual Swiss and a collection of a quarter of a million Mao badges. What he says is usually impeccably well argued, but it is the delivery which makes him so sought after as a speaker: he is a master of rhetoric, and of vivid everyday examples, and the very dry sense of humour and the heavy Swiss accent provide an irresistible mix. (He describes his own writing as ‘SwissGerman pidgin English, but is actually one of the most articulate and grammatical people I know.) It is amazing how much vitriol the mention of Faber’s name can generate mainly from traders with a limited sense of historical perspective. He is well aware of this reaction. Back in 1987, he wrote: ‘No one likes a party spoiler, and as long as the stockmarket orgy goes on the pessimists are shunned almost as badly as AIDS carriers.’ The more intelligent professionals around town give him considerably more respect even when they don’t understand the detail of his operations. Some assume that he says one thing and invests differently. Other people assume he is a simplistic and publicityseeking contrarian. A large number think of him as ‘Dr Doom’, the congenital pessimist. He plays up this image, or is at least amused by it and lets it run.PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS – Investing has a lot to do with common sense and personal observations. The man on the street frequently knows far more about the state of the economy than politicians, university professors and financial analysts who seldom travel, or if they do so, only from one first class hotel to another first class hotel and from one golf course to another. The pulse and vibrancy of an economy is, however, nowhere more visible than in a country’s entertainment venues such as bars, restaurants, nightclubs and shopping centres.

Fox News, aka “Faux News,” often talks about having a hatred and resentment of poor people. They throw out statistics about “poor households” that are just plain ridiculous. They claim that poor people shouldn’t have basic appliances like refrigerators and microwaves.A blogger on Cracked, going by John Cheese, shows the ridiculousness of these claims by using his mother as an example. He went on a Fox News-style rant about the things in his mother’s home.When talking about her refrigerator, he said:“What the hell is that bullshit? She claims to be poor, but right there in front of me is a refrigerator! She didn’t even try to hide it. It’s right out in the open, where any tax-dollar-providing citizen — nay, hero — can see. As if that wasn’t enough, notice that in the bottom-left corner of the picture, there’s a chair propped up against the door to hold it shut, because the magnetic strip has long lost its holding power. So my mother not only owns chairs, but owns so many that she can use one as a doorstop?”When he got to her medicine, he said:“Oh my Tax God of the Dollarverse, what is going on? I thought I knew my mother, but this is too much. Here I am, working 7,000 hours per week in order to give the government money, who in turn gives it to her, and she’s hoarding baskets of drugs like some sort of … drug hoarder. This is the true face of drug-fueled poverty right here, sheeple, and you need to wake up.”Side note: “Tax God of the Dollarverse” may be my new favorite phrase.I guess I’m living the life that Faux News would find “luxurious.” I have a chronic condition, but how dare I have a phone and a car? I guess I have offended the Tax God of the Dollarverse with my wicked ways.Here are The Young Turks talking about this topic:Featured image via YouTube screenshot.

Radical left-wing communist media organization Fox News has recently reported that some scribbles on some rocks in Australia are 28,000 years old.It is fine if they present this as a “theory” that some “scientists” have. However, if they were really a fair and balanced news organization, as they claim, they would have also presented the argument that the world is only 6,000 years old and that these rock pictures were drawn by a race of evil demons called the lamia (which are mentioned in the Bible!).  The lamia were the earliest examples of evil and therefore liberals, so it is no surprise that they would be planting fictional evidence to try to make people think that the world is older than it really is.How can we tell that these cave drawings were created by liberal demons?  Look at a close-up of this highlighted section to the left!WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?I’m not sure, but it sure looks anti-Family to me.…This entire rock picture is very suspicious, and it is clear that whenever it was made, it was drawn by liberals. I have added the appropriate speech bubble in the original picture to signify this fact.original story: FoxNews.com








Dot connectors, Twitter diagram creators and newly minted Russia-conspiracy sleuths from sea to shining sea take note. Since anything connected to Russia is now considered treasonous, I’ve got a great story for you to sniff out. It relates to John Podesta, but somehow I doubt you’ll be interested in this one…The Daily Caller reports:John Podesta, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2016 national campaign chairman, may have violated federal law by failing to disclose the receipt of 75,000 shares of stock from a Kremlin-financed company when he joined the Obama White House in 2014, according to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group.Joule Unlimited Technologies — financed in part by a Russian firm —  originally awarded Podesta 100,000 shares of stock options when in 2010 he joined that board along with its Dutch-based entities: Joule Global Holdings, BV and the Stichting Joule Global Foundation.When Podesta announced his departure from the Joule board in January 2014 to become President Obama’s special counsellor, the company officially issued him 75,000 common shares of stock.The Schedule B section of the federal government’s form 278 which — requires financial disclosures for government officials — required Podesta to “report any purchase, sale or exchange by you, your spouse, or dependent children…of any property, stocks, bonds, commodity futures and other securities when the amount of the transaction exceeded $1,000.”The same year Podesta joined Joule, the company agreed to accept 1-Billion-Rubles — or $35 million — from Rusnano, a state-run and financed Russian company with close ties to President Vladimir Putin.Anatoly Chubais, the company CEO and two other top Russian banking executives worked together with Podesta on the Joule boards. The board met six times a year.Ron Hosko, a former FBI assistant director said because of the Kremlin backing, it was essential Podesta disclose the financial benefits he received from the company.“I think in this case where you’re talking about foreign interests and foreign involvement, the collateral interest with these disclosure forms is put in the forefront of full disclosure of any foreign interest that you may have,” he told TheDCNF in an interview.The existence of the 75,000 shares of Joule stock was first revealed by the Government Accountability Institute report issued last year.But Podesta didn’t pocket all the shares. Correspondence from Podesta to Joule instructed the firm to transfer only 33,693 shares to Leonidio Holdings, a brand-new entity he incorporated only on December 20, 2013, about ten days before he entered the White House.Leonidio is registered in Delaware as a limited liability corporation. Podesta listed the address of his daughter, Megan Rouse, in the incorporation papers. His mother and father also appear to be co-owners of Leonidio.TheDCNF made multiple inquiries to OGE and received no reply. TheDCNF inquiries to Mr. Podesta were not returned.Personally, I doubt any of the above is a huge deal, and I certainly don’t think Podesta is working for Vladimir Putin under the table. However, just imagine the hysteria if the above narrative could’ve been connected to anyone in Trump’s orbit. It would’ve been plastered on the front page of The Washington Post and The New York Times with headlines like, “More Financial Ties Emerge Between Those in Trump’s Orbit and Putin.”Naturally, you won’t see this story hyped because it doesn’t fit the corporate media narrative, and the narrative is all they care about.If you enjoyed this post, and want to contribute to genuine, independent media, consider visiting our Support Page.In Liberty,

LibertyNEWS POLL: Are you glad Paul Ryan's Obamacare 2.0 failed?  Click here to vote and see instant results!
----Following years of controversy regarding excessive use of force by law enforcement, the Fraternal Order of Police is calling on the Trump Administration to rescind Barack Obama’s 2015 executive order which banned law enforcement agencies from receiving military grade weapons and certain armored vehicles previously provided to departments under the DoD’s 1033 Program.The program which came under heavy criticism following the Michael Brown shooting and subsequent deployment of military grade equipment during the Ferguson riots previously provided law enforcement agencies with surplus military grade equipment, however, under Obama’s executive order the DoD was banned from providing items such as:While that is not a complete list of the items banned under Obama’s executive order it will give you a pretty realistic idea of what the Fraternal Order of Police is asking the Trump Administration to return.Additionally, as an individual that did in fact report live from ground zero during the Ferguson riots I can say in all honestly that the equipment deployed by authorities was disconcerting to say the least… However, with that said, what happened in Ferguson was by no means an ordinary scenario.While I refuse to state that law enforcement was flat out wrong in their response to the matter (because they were not all), I will note that there was a very concerning and obvious lack of training on the part of some officers using said equipment. Moving on…Asking the current administration to follow through on Trump’s campaign promise to law enforcement in which he stated that he would rescind Obama’s ban, Fraternal Order of Police national president Chuck Canterbury posted on the organization’s website that “We’re going to remind him of that promise and ask him to deliver.”The Fraternal Order of Police is the largest police union in the United States, boasting over 333,000 law enforcement members across the country.Via FoxNewsPolice unions expect the Trump administration to rescind former President Barack Obama’s 2015 executive order that banned local police from acquiring tank-like armored vehicles, grenade launchers and other equipment from the federal government. Last year, Mr. Trump said he would rescind the Obama order.The union’s executive board met Tuesday morning at the White House with Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.An executive order issued by Mr. Trump last month called for stiffer penalties for harming officers, echoing recommendations made by police unions to the Trump transition team, according to William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, a coalition of unions and associations representing about 240,000 officers.“To see that you’re like, ‘Wow,’ they really listened to what we said and they’re trying to put it in place,” said Mr. Johnson. “For eight years we were beating our heads against the wall.”Thoughts on this?

Disturbing headlines have been emanating lately from North Korea. Earlier this month, Japan held its first public missile drill in reaction the threats posed by its neighbor. An ominous story appearing this morning at The Hill outlined the manner whereby the rogue nation could kill 90% of Americans.Seemingly unfazed by the threats, GOP Sen. John McCain  decided to poke the beast with a stick in a TV appearance last week in which he called North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un a “crazy fat kid”  on TV.The Korean Central News Agency accused the senator on Tuesday of hurting the dignity of the country and the supreme leadership of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The state-run outlet also criticized GOP Texas Sen. Ted Cruz  and other conservative hawks for their efforts to re-list North Korea as a state-sponsor of terrorism.McCain told MSNBC’s Greta van Susteren in an interview on March 22 that the “crazy fat kid that’s running North Korea” is far worse than some of history’s worst dictators. “He’s not rational, Greta,” he explained. “We’re not dealing even with someone like Joseph Stalin, who had a certain rationality to his barbarity.”Cruz led the charge to re-designate North Korea as a state-sponsor of terrorism, introducing new legislation two weeks ago.KCNA wrote that the two senators’ actions and statements are manifestations “of their worst hostility toward the DPRK’s ideology, social system, and its people and a grave provocation little short of a declaration of war against it,” adding:The service personnel and people of the DPRK are regarding the dignity of their supreme leadership as their life and soul. The DPRK will take steps to counter.The senators “will have to bitterly experience the disastrous consequences to be entailed by their reckless tongue-lashing and then any regret for it will come too late,” KCNA warned, further adding:The revolutionary forces of the DPRK with its nuclear force for as [sic] its pivot will fulfill its sacred mission of devotedly defending its supreme leadership representing the destiny and life of its people by dealing a merciless sledge-hammer blow at those daring [to] hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership.The North concluded its response by asserting that McCain and Cruz are “like [puppies] knowing no fear of the tiger.”This report, by Ryan Pickrell, was cross-posted by arrangement with the Daily Caller News Foundation.Promoting and defending liberty, as defined by the nation’s founders, requires both facts and philosophical thought, transcending all elements of our culture, from partisan politics to social issues, the workings of government, and entertainment and off-duty interests.

On Tuesday, Moore took to social media and noted that March 28, 2017 will from now on be remembered as the day President Donald Trump kicked off the extinction of the human race on the planet.According to Breitbart, Moore posted on his Facebook profile, and pointed out that Trump is ready to declare “war on the planet.” This came straight after Trump signed new climate bill order and revoked Obama’s previous one. “Historians in the near future (because that may be the only future we have) will mark today, March 28, 2017, as the day the extinction of human life on earth began,” Moore wrote on his Facebook page.“This is a defining moment in the history of mankind. By signing these executive orders today, Trump is declaring an act of war on the planet and its inhabitants,” he continued. “The one silver lining here is that Trump can’t kill the planet; the planet wants to live and has a long history of wiping out any real or perceived threats.”He made sure to let people know what that they need to pay attention on what’s happening. Donald Trump said that he and his team are “putting an end to the war on coal.” He was accompanied by EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Vice President Mike Pence.Moore is well-known liberal who loves making documentaries to convince people of America of anything but the democrat guilt. Back in January, Moore vowed to lead “100 days of resistance” to oppose Trump’s team.The director was also protesting the failed GOP bill that was supposed to replace the Affordable Care Act, and called this “anti-woman” and “hateful.”I think Michael Moore should turn to making documentaries about what’s happening behind closed doors on the liberal part. But, no, he plays-pretend for a living just like the Democrats, and we can only expect top-ranking nonsense from people like him.What do you think about this? Make sure to SHARE story and let everyone know of Moore’s hypocrisy!

Cops & Criminals, Politics
A Massachusetts politician was in for a bit more than she bargained after helping illegal aliens escape an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raid. Unfortunately for the bleeding heart liberal, it wasn’t long before her criminal behavior came back to bite her big time – and she most recently got that smug grin wiped right off her face.Massachusetts state Rep. Michelle DuBois is facing quite a bit of backlash after her most recent Facebook post. As it turns out, she learned that ICE may be in the area of Brockton, MA, prompting her to warn everyone “just in case.”“I got the following information from my friend in the Latin community: ‘I have a message for the immigrant community of Brockton. Please be careful on Wednesday 29. ICE will be in Brockton on that day.’”“If you are undocumented don’t go out on the street,” DuBois, who represents the 10th district, added. “If there is a knock on the door of your house and you don’t know who it is, don’t open the door. I ask you to be careful.” [Source: The Daily Caller]As one would imagine, the reaction on social media was swift and harsh as the woman sought to aid and abet fugitives from law enforcement. Of course, it doesn’t take a genius to see why a criminal act on behalf of those who have already broken the law is a bad idea, but it seems that Ms. DuBois doesn’t quite get it.In fact, she’s since taken to defending her actions despite the brutal backlash she’s received. Saying that she will not take her post down, the entitled brat then went on to whine about people being upset with her before following up with this:Unfortunately for her, that may be the least of her concerns. At just about the same time that DeBois was posting to Facebook, a Massachusetts law enforcement official, Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, was publicly demanding the arrest of sanctuary city leaders.“If these sanctuary cities are going to harbor and conceal criminal illegal aliens from ICE, which is in direct violation of Title 8 of the U.S. Code, federal arrest warrants should be issued for their elected officials,” Hodgson told the House Subcommittee on Illegal Immigration. “Our citizens would be safer if we never stopped enforcing immigration law and if we never formed or turned a blind eye toward sanctuary cities.”However, his attention would quickly turn to DuBois when he heard what she had done. “This is the most outrageous, outrageous example of what is going on across the United States that is undermining my job and every other law enforcement officer in the United States,” he said shortly after.Although no criminal actions have been launched thus far, things didn’t turn out well for the last liberal who decided to help an illegal alien escape. As Mad World News previously reported, Judge Monica Herranz in Oregon is now under investigation after letting an illegal alien escape out her private chambers exit in order to avoid the ICE agents waiting to detain him out front.With this blatant disregard for the law, one can only imagine how long before an investigation into DuBois’ actions is initiated. Although she’s currently under fire from people all across the nation – and rightfully so – it certainly seems that people pointing out her criminal behavior should be the least of her worries.Lawlessness is no longer regarded as bold or admirable as it has been during the previous administration. If this woman has proven anything, it’s that she regards her opinions as higher than the law and is unfit to serve for that reason alone. Dubois has to go – and if that means she spends a few days in jail to serve as a warning to others, then so be it. She’d only have herself to blame.








President Obama has decided that he is no longer going to answer any questions about the terror attacks in Benghazi that left four Americans dead.Just look what happened when Rep. Trey Gowdy recently sent the White House a list of questions about the attack…From The Federalist Papers via Politico:How convenient.Gowdy still hasn’t received a response from Obama, and I bet he never will.Instead, he was sharply criticized for his panel’s “motives.”Makes sense, right?H/T Young ConservativesOn Monday’s broadcast of CBS’ “The Late Show,” CNN anchor Anderson Cooper said, “I’ve actually muted the president on Twitter.”A new study finds that 88 percent of coverage of President Donald Trump and his administration is negative.

ByPritha Paul Editor’s note: You are viewing Morning News USA’s Debunked section. This section contains news that we have investigated and uncovered to be fake news, satire news, hoaxes and urban legends.The show “Tom And Jerry” has been watched and adored by billions of people across the world. But unknown to many, the show may have ended with Tom and Jerry committing suicide.While the idea of the adorable cat and mouse taking their own lives seems dark, considering that the show is meant for kids, that is exactly what a recently circulating Facebook meme suggests.The horrific meme shows Tom signing away his life savings then trying to drown himself. Jerry does manage to save him, though.Read Also: University Requires All Students To Wear Hijab – Facts To KnowHowever, Jerry for some reason is seen joining a bloodshot-eyed Tom. Both of them sit on the railway tracks, waiting for the train to arrive. The meme ends with the train assumed to have crushed both while blood sprinkles everywhere!The meme has gone viral, with people expressing their shock; some even condemned the cartoon show.As it turns out, the meme was made by editing one particular episode in November 1956. The episode titled “Blue Cat Blues” shows Tom falling in love with a she-cat and doing everything he can to please her.Read Also:United Airlines To Charge For Overhead Storage – Facts To KnowHowever, fate takes a nasty turn when Tom encounters the competition for his love affair – Mr. Butch.The rich Mr. Butch soon steals her from Tom, and no amount of expensive gifts brings her back to Tom’s life. At last, a depressed Tom gets too drunk (relax, on milk!) and decides to commit suicide.Jerry, who until then was convinced he was dating a faithful girl, also discovers in a similar manner that his girlfriend was cheating on her. He decides to join Tom in waiting for the train.Read Also: Queen Elizabeth Makes Wearing Burqa A Law, UK Goes Full Islamic? Facts To KnowThis is where the meme digresses from the original episode. Because in the original episode, it cuts to black after Tom and Jerry are seen sitting heartbroken on the tracks.This proves that the meme is a fake creation meant to shock people.Moreover, the caption of the meme says, “Tom And Jerry Final Episode..They commit suicide..” This fact is also incorrect, since there were more episodes released after the aforementioned one. The one immediately afterwards was titled “Barbeque Brawl.”The following was the meme that has popped up on Facebook:Watch both episodes below and see for yourself:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHpgd95_Y5whttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE1jYuuXPUIRead Also: Muslim Donuts On Christmas?

(L.E.MORMILE / Shutterstock, Inc.)TRUMP TOWER – President-Elect Donald J. Trump has reportedly assured NJ Governor Chris Christie that, despite recent reports, he has not been banished from his inner circle, and will nominate the Bridgegate behemoth to the Supreme Food Court.“Mr. Trump decided it would be humorous to have his little “Christie Kreme” (his new Secret Service name, according to insiders) around, so he created the special position just for him,” says Trump’s longtime attorney/bankruptcy expert, David Friedman.In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a “yes, I’ll have another” man that won’t clash with his own oversize, portly ego. “I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him,” said Trump’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and he knows he’ll do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.”Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. “Mr. Christie’s transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless,” he said. “I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.”Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trump’s campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a “gargantuan-sized heart” and is “the perfect fit” for the new court.“Governor Christie is not only ‘pro-life’, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know,” Miller said, “and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, I’ve seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat. Trust me, there’s nothing to worry about.” Miller joked that Christie loves and supports the NRA almost as much as KFC. “He will step up to the plate, that’s for damn sure.”While often referred to as the “butterball” of the “Grand Old Party Sub,” it appears Mr. Christie’s nomination to the Supreme Food Court is already a foregone conclusion.








Subscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.Thank you for subscribing.Something went wrong.We respect your privacy and take protecting it seriouslyBy Heather Callaghan, EditorWhenever I hear the sarcastic term “first world problems” I cringe inside. The Western world is steeped in pain. All kinds of pain – physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. While some things like bacterial infections and vitamin deficiencies were muzzled back in the 20th century, this world has never seen so much chronic pain, chronic immune issues and chronic mystery illness. Big Pharma – the “legal” drug lords that they are – claim the entire Western world as their territory. This cartel has got the “good stuff” – the stuff that quiets the desperate pain – possibly forever. Their carefully executed algorithms have determined that even if they kill off their customers, they make billions. We don’t have an “opioid epidemic” – as though it’s the fault of patients – no! we have an “addiction and death by pill” epidemic. How these deaths are not considered “assisted but unwillful suicide,” I’ll never know…It’s not just these deaths, but the heroin overdoses that happen when people get turned away from the medical system. How it’s legal to hook someone and remove their free will, I’ll never know either.So of course it shouldn’t surprise anyone that people want – and deserve – harmless alternatives – whether it’s marijuana, kratom, or some other type of herb.I’m surprised I haven’t come across wild lettuce as an alternative to toxic pain, migraine and anxiety pills, but a recent report by Ask a Prepper tipped me off to it and now I want to tell everyone! Out of everyone I know, pain is their biggest complaint! While people tell us that we shouldn’t focus on pain, but what’s causing the pain – everyone with serious pain knows that you can’t move forward or think straight until you can get some relief.Wild Lettuce via Ask a PrepperLactuca Virosa – aka “opium lettuce” or bitter lettuce – must be one of the modern world’s best kept secrets. And it’s probably getting mowed down in your backyard!Look for it in North America and England. Hopefully the pictures will help but apparently it’s tall, leafy and can have small, yellow buds. It contains a milky, white substance with the opium-like qualities – however, it’s important to know that the plant contains no opiates and is perfectly legal.Photo via Ask a PrepperAsk a Prepper says this milky substance is called lactucarium “acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to lessen the feeling of pain, just like morphine.” This is extremely good news for those with Epstein-Barr Virus, Fibromyalgia, nerve injury, surgical pain and inflammation.

They report that wild lettuce wasn’t a secret in the 1800s, but was also sought as an alternative to opium, which was basically a scourge on the earth at the time. Apparently, it made a comeback in the 1970s when natural health food stores began cropping up more and more. The bitterness of the herb has made teas, tinctures, resins, or even smoking/vaping a more popular way to take than historical reduction cooking methods.Ask a Prepper says that along with pain, people are now seeking wild lettuce remedy for:It makes sense that something that helps anxiety also eases insomnia. Some people report fewer migraine episodes after using wild lettuce. A lesser-known side effect to opioid drugs is their effects on the lungs – and that asthmatics can suffer more episodes during opioid withdrawal. Anecdotally, some of them try wild lettuce for easing out of withdrawal. “Wild lettuce has antitussive properties, which alleviates or suppresses a cough,” they report. Wild lettuce should be studied more for this benefit since each year, 5,000 of people die annually of asthma in the United States.
They note that this non-opiate plant has euphoric qualities and has also been used recreationally.

By Rex Kramer | Leave/Read Comments Seventh Star Church in Alabama is celebrating Black Sabbath’s retirement.Jackson, MS – As the final ear-bleeding refrains of Paranoid came to a close at Birmingham’s Genting Arena, Christians around the world breathed a collective sigh of relief. After nearly a half century of turning America’s youth onto the occult, heavy drug use and sexual perversion, it finally signaled ‘The End’ of Black Sabbath.Seventh Star Church organist and HIS (Hands in Servitude) volunteer, Eileen Ulick, will host Reclaiming the Sabbath, a weekend-long celebration of Black Sabbath’s retirement.“It’s time to rejoice and praise The Lord that the abomination known as Black Sabbath is finally over,” said Ulick, speaking via Skype during a HIS gathering at her home in downtown Jackson. “We are spiritually and symbolically reclaiming the holy Sabbath for our Lord and savior Jesus Christ,” she said.Black Sabbath was formed in Birmingham, England, in 1968 by guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist, Terence “Geezer” Butler, drummer William Ward and singer John “Ozzy” Osbourne. After admittedly selling their souls to Satan, the band released their self-titled debut album on Friday the 13th, 1970, to instant worldwide success.The song, Black Sabbath, inspired by a vision Geezer had of a cloaked figure standing over the foot of his bed, makes good use of the ominous diminished fifth, also known as ‘The Devil’s Interval’, a musical tritone once banned by clerics in the Middle Ages for fear it would raise the devil.Guitarist Tony Iommi developed his unique playing style after voices in his head instructed him to chop off his own finger tips. The next day at the sheet metal plant, he stuck his fretting hand under a machine blade, severing two fingertips. Losing his fingertips led Iommi to experiment with detuning and lighter gauge strings, thus creating the sound and style of heavy metal “on accident.”The band soon left England after playing an impromptu Black Mass for a group of Satanists at Stonehenge.Black Sabbath was launched in the U.S. with a party hosted by The Church of Satan, with non-other than The Satanic Bible author, Anton Lavey, presiding over the festivities.“I blame FM radio for ever playing them in the first place,” says Southern Cross Church Pastor, Wayne Kerr. “Disc jockeys back in the late sixties [and] early seventies had lost their moral compass and were promoting filth disguised as music to impressionable teenagers.”Pastor Kerr will be bringing along his flock of parishioners from Biloxi to join in the celebration. “The burden of preaching against this vile group has left me mentally and physically disturbed,” said Kerr. “I honestly believed Mr. Osbourne, and especially Mr. Ward, would have perished decades ago. Not even cancer could stop Mr. Iommi. [It was] definitely a demonic force that has kept the band in business all these years.”Southern Cross member, Sharon Dix, recalls the time her 17-year-old son, Holden Dix, snuck off to a Black Sabbath concert while on a youth mission trip to Wisconsin. “Mission leaders had to pick him up from the Milwaukee County Jail,” she said. “He told me the relentless, bestial rhythms possessed him to harm himself and others.”Sharon believes Holden was seduced by something purely evil. “They took something from my son that night. The light in his eyes…he’s never been the same since.”Mrs. Dix is referencing the infamous Oct. 9th 1980 ‘Black and Blue’ tour stop at Milwaukee’s Mecca Arena, where rioters trashed the building and assaulted police officers who were called to the scene. When the smoke finally cleared, one hundred and sixty people were arrested for various drug-related charges, disorderly conduct and criminal damage to property. Over a dozen police officers were injured in the melee.That year Sabbath was promoting the album, Heaven and Hell, their first release with on-again-off-again replacement singer, Ronnie James Dio. Ronnie is best known for inventing the ‘devil horn salute’, a crude hand gesture made to mock Christ and pledge loyalty to Satan and heavy metal. Before his death in 2010, Dio had rejoined Iommi and Butler to release The Devil You Know, a Sabbath offshoot project that included such songs as Bible Black & Atom and Evil.“It’s finally time for closure,” says born again Christian Patrick Crowley. “I was a big Sab fan for over twenty years. I had all the albums and wore the t-shirts.” Mr. Crowley says he is fortunate he made it out alive. “It was always the same thing, get loaded and crank the Live Evil guitar solo cruising Main Street in my Dodge Dart. God had a plan for me. Giving up Sabbath was the best decision I ever made.”The band’s nineteenth and final studio album, 13, the first to feature original members Osbourne, Iommi & Butler, since 1978’s Never Say Die!, was released in 2013. The album’s lead single, God is Dead, won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance, proving once and for all the nefarious inner workings of the entertainment industry elite.While Ozzy, now 68-years-old, is still making headlines due to his insatiable appetite for adultery, it’s comforting to know that the menace known as Black Sabbath have unplugged their cocaine stuffed amplifiers for the final time.Reclaiming the Sabbath will be held Oct 13th at the Sleeping Village Community Rec Center off Interstate 55 in Ridgeway.

After practically stalling and then failing to come with a reasonable replacement for Obamacare, Trump’s approval rating plummeted severely.According to a new Morning Consult/POLITICO survey conducted after the House GOP’s bill was pulled from the floor on Friday, 46 percent of registered voters said they approved of Trump’s performance in office, down 4 points from the previous week. Meanwhile, his disapproval rating rose to 50 percent, up 6 points from the past survey. It’s the first time more voters have disapproved of Trump’s performance since Morning Consult began tracking his job approval. Surprising?  I think not.Here is a visual from the moment the so-called president took office courtesy of Politico:Due to the legislation’s failure, it resulted in  a major setback for Trump, one that he may not bounce back. In a normal scenario, Trump will blame this entire failed healthcare on Paul Ryan despite voicing optimism late Tuesday that a deal on healthcare still remains possible. Trump said:“I know that we are going to make a deal on healthcare.” “That’s such an easy one.”“I have no doubt that’s going to happen very quickly,” Trump added. “We have all been promising it — Democrat, Republican — to the public.”One would think the billionaire would come up with some type of solution, since it’s so easy for him. This just proves that Republicans have failed to keep yet another promise to the American people. Ensuring an affordable, well-suitable healthcare is not an easy task to accomplish–it took President Obama quite sometime to present a bill that will save millions of Americans. Trump claims he can basically do it over night. Due to his lack of knowledge and inability to come to grips with reality, he is now in deep, deep trouble–America will not stand for this.   Featured Image via Getty Images

In a breaking news story, we have received evidence that Obama and John Kerry did not require Irans leaders to sign the nuclear deal that his team negotiated with the regime, and the deal is not “legally binding,” his administration acknowledged.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});



Obama and Iran agreed that a legally binding deal would be strongly discouraged and disapproved of in the United States, so they wanted to skip the “legally binding” part and just give Iran everything they asked for if Iran promised not to use the nuclear weapons on countries.

In a non legally binding agreement, Iran was given:

A lift on $100 billion in sanctions.
They were paid more than $36 billion for “long overdue actions.”
Unlimited access to trade with Europe again.
A lift on the arms embargo. They can buy and sell weapons from anyone, anywhere, anytime they want to.
They are allowed to run “safety tests” on themselves.
They report “illegal actions” themselves to the U.N. Meaning, Iran will tell Obama and the U.N. if they are acting criminally or inappropriately.


What the United States got:

Anti-American propaganda videos where American sailors were captured and humiliated.
Iran has test-fired an illegal long-range missile on several occasions.
Iran detained dozens of Americans and held them until Obama paid them a ransom.


That is it. We got absolutely nothing. We armed a jihadi maniac with nuclear weapons and gave them everything they asked for.

There is a silver lining: The deal was never signed, so two things can occur.

First, Trump can rip the deal up on day one and we can place all of the restrictions and bans right back on Iran while forcing them to destroy their nuclear systems.

Second, this was a clear act of treason by Obama and Kerry, and they should be charged once Trump is in office. The United States labels Iran as the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, so that means the United States is working with terrorists.

Under the “Stop Funding Terrorists Bill,” which is going to House floor next week, if Republicans vote to pass this, Obama and any other government agency or official that supplies terrorists can be charged with treason.

Would you support Donald Trump charging Obama and Kerry with treason for this horrendous deal that placed the entire world at risk?

All you need is to use the information that the bookmaker provides to decide the kind of bet that you make and you can easily secure a win. 








Hooooooooo-doggie! Now, it’s no surprise to anyone now that Obama’s EX-CIA Chief John Brennan HATES Donald Trump. I mean the second he left office he called our new president “Despicable” after he met with the CIA. SO NASTY!However, President Trump is NOT gonna stand for this! Trump revealed that the CIA didn’t find him “Despicable,” THEY LOVED HIM!‘Had a great meeting at CIA Headquarters yesterday, packed house, paid great respect to Wall, long standing ovations, amazing people. WIN!’
Haha. The best revenge is to succeed DESPITE your attackers. John Brennan ran a VERY corrupt CIA with his low-point being him LYING about hacking Congress (Which the CIA cannot legally do).Brennan is just lucky he is not in jail already. Trump has EVERY right to go after him, especially considering how much “leaking” the CIA was doing to the press under him.However, President Trump is not just giving up on the American Intelligence community. Now that he is President, he is gonna do his best to clean them up. He is with them “1000%”!If you are happy with President Donald Trump so far, then show your support by Sharing this on Facebook!!(H/T – Daily Mail) comments

A conservative preacher and vocal supporter of President Donald Trump shared claims an “anointed” cake “saved” a gay bartender. Lance Wallnau was answering a question via a Periscope session from a viewer who wanted to stop her son from being gay, according to a video that Right Wing Watch posted online. In response, he shared the story of “hookers” who got “saved” and wanted to help a bar owner “who was gay and very adamantly anti-Christian.” So they baked him a cake and prayed over it, he said. “It was an anointed cake,” Wallnau said. “The power of God hit him while he was eating the cake.” Wallnau claimed the bar owner felt “the presence of God” while eating the cake and underwent some kind of transformation and was eventually baptized.To make matters even more ludicrous, the preacher also announced that he conducted extensive research and managed to obtain the recipe for the “anointed cake,” which he then decided he would “patent and market to the religiously-challenged Americans.” “I have to admit, the idea didn’t come to me right away,” Wallnau said in an interview with the Dallas Morning Star. “As a matter of fact, it actually dawned on me while I was watching an old Jerry Springer re-run online. It was about a family who was nearly devastated by drugs and the father’s homosexual infidelity, but they were somehow able to find God and reunite. That’s when it hit me that there’s an entire market out there screaming for a quick fix, for something that’s able to save normal people from the plague of gays.”He continued, “After doing some serious digging, I was able to come up with the recipe for the cake, which I’ve decided to patent and then possibly license to other church-endorsed businesses willing to join the battle against homosexualism. We have to be honest here – there are a lot of fallen Christians in this country, and a significant portion of them are simultaneously in the claws of the homosexual plague. We need a game changer here, something that’s going to tip the scales. I am confident that the anointed cake is it; we just need to market it properly. Because, at the end of the day, it’s still a product like any other and the owner of the patent, which is to say, yours truly, still needs to make a living regardless of his nobility.”Asked to elaborate on how the cake works, Wallnau explained that it “protects normal people” from gays by making them extremely unattractive. “Now, I know what the nay-sayers are going to be on about here. ‘How’s that different from any other cake that makes people fat?’ or something or other. Well, the Anointed Cake not only makes people fat, but it also provides a one-of-a-kind religious experience to those who taste it. They are purified by it – I mean that both figuratively and literally, since in addition to bringing a person closer to God, it also brings them closer to the toilet, due to the fact that laxative is one of it’s main ingredients. When you add acne, diabetes and oily skin into the mix as well, it becomes clear that the anointed cake is by far the most powerful weapon in the war against gay people. And the best part is, you only have to eat it for two weeks before seeing the first results,” the preacher concluded.  








Reclusive billionaire Mr Toad will team up with Supergran to recruit Britain’s greatest heroes in this summer’s blockbuster hit.After Bananaman is believed killed in battle with sinister agents of the Banana Republic, Earth stands defenceless against malign alien forces – leading to a team being created for a desperate defence led by Toad, who lives in a secret high-tech hole in the Riverbank and drives a souped up expensive motor-car.It is currently unknown who the villains will be, although trailer footage showing Metal Mickey biffing The Mekon in the face suggests a threat from Venus is the most likely.Fans have been sharing a clip from the film which shows SuperTed asking Mr Toad what his superpower is, only for Toad to reply “I’m jolly rich, old chap. Poop! Poop!” before driving into a tree.“It’s Earth’s mightiest heroes”, said comics fan Simon Williams, who told us he could barely wait.“Supergran. Superted. Dangermouse. Metal Mickey. Mister Toad. I can’t wait to find out what sort of threat will require that amount of power to defeat. I bet it’ll be the Daleks and the Mekon is just a bait and switch like they always do in the trailer.“I hope Davros is in it. I’d love to see Supergran belt him with her handbag.“There’s no way Bananaman will stay dead. They’ll bring him back by feeding him a special super banana sprinkled with magic dust by the Spotty Man or something, I bet you.”Producers have denied that Timothy Claypole will appear in the film as “He’s a twat and everyone hates him.“And Russell Brand said he was busy.”








Islamic State have today claimed responsibility for a spate of BMW drivers driving aggressively and erratically cutting up other road users and getting points on their licenses.“We are driving like twats until Britain becomes an Islamic caliphate” One man in a 330 M sport with smoked rear windows told us.“The bloke I bought it off assured me it’s got Allah wheels.”  He added.“We will wear the West down in a war of attrition, undertaking and running red traffic lights,  until we are rewarded with 72 virgins” A spokesman for BMW at their Oxford headquarters is seen announcing in a chilling video screened via You tube.“It’s clearly in the name of jihad. Why else would they keep driving like nobs in a sustained attack starting in the 1980s.” One road user remarked.However other road users have vowed to carry on as normal and not give BMW drivers the satisfaction. Indeed Political commentator Andrew Neil said “You can park your X6 4 litre cock mobile on double yellow lines to your hearts content. We don’t like it. But life will carry on as normal.”

 A massive protest has gathered in front of PM David Cameron’s official London residence at 10 Downing Street , calling for his resignation. The rally follows the so-called Panama Papers leak, which among others exposed the offshore dealings of Cameron’s late father. “Cameron must go!” and “Tories out!” read the placards held by the demonstrators.Class War, Socialist Workers Party and Anonymous were among the crowds present. So  anyway I decided to do what any good blogger would do and filmed as much as I could and give my readers an raw insight into the protest.Some of the donors, MPs and high net worth business people who have supported David Cameron’s rise to power have links to the United Kingdom’s  network of tax havens, the Panama leaks reveal.Former Conservative MPs and six members of the House of Lords are among those with connections to companies on the books of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca.The irony is that The British prime minister has been calling for reforms, recognising – along with other world leaders – that the system is too secret.In 2012, Cameron criticised complex offshore structures saying it is “not fair and not right”. At a G8 summit in Enniskillen three years ago, he demanded more transparency, saying this would be better for business in the UK.Personally I think David’s been “less than 100% honest” about profiting from his father’s offshore fund. “For ordinary taxpayers to have faith in the system they have to be able to have faith in their leaders. They deserve better than half truths and qualified statements.” Remember “The Prime Minister has previously described the actions of others who invested in these complex schemes as ‘morally wrong’!

Manistee, Mi. – Two drug dealers/producers were arrested this morning, after they rent their illegal drug lab on AIRBnB.According to police report, Steve Jackson and Aaron Murphy put an advertisement on the famous homesharing site on Tuesday, offering to rent their “cozy apartment with fully equipped meth lab” while they were “out of town to make a few deliveries“.The ad was rapidly signaled by AIRBnB users, and ended up catching the attention of the State Sheriffs Chiefs Enforcement Narcotics Team, also known as SSCENT, a multi-jurisdictional task force that investigates drug activity.Policemen invaded the men’s property this morning, arresting both of them and seized various controlled substances. Officers reported finding several items used to make meth in the kitchen and garage.A delivery truck belonging to one of the accused was also located in a nearby street and searched, and it turned out to be loaded with more crystal meth.Both men now face numerous criminal charges, including counts of operating/maintaining a laboratory involving methamphetamine, possession of methamphetamine and possession of cocaine, according to the release. The charges carry penalties ranging from four to 20 years in prison.They are expected to appear in court on Monday, but meanwhile, they are lodged in the Manistee County Jail with bond set at $100,000.

You know that saying about how hell hath no fury like a woman scorned? That may not be a universal truth, but it certainly seems to apply to one furious wife in China who caught her husband cheating and decided to take revenge by chopping off his penis — not once, but twice.Fan Lung, 32, a father of five, drew the wrath of his wife Feng, age 21 (both pictured above at the hospital), when he reportedly used her phone to send a racy email to his mistress. Fan forgot to log out of his account, and when Feng later read the email, she grabbed a pair of scissors and cut off Fan’s penis while he was sleeping.Doctors were able to re-attach the penis at the hospital, but Feng wasn’t finished with her revenge. She was able to sneak into the recovery room and cut off his penis a second time. This time, she threw it out a nearby window. Fan, shocked by the second incident, chased his wife outside even though he was bleeding heavily. According to a spokesman for the hospital, “Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”Unfortunately for Fan, by the time staff members were able to search for the missing member, they were unable to find it. They speculate that dogs or cats might have carried it off once Feng threw it outside.After this entire fiasco, Feng is now in police custody under charges of grievous bodily harm. Fan’s mistress, 21-year-old Zhang Hung, says that it doesn’t matter to her if her boyfriend can’t ever have children again. She said that because he already has five kids, it’s enough for her.








About one in three Americans take a multivitamin. Is that helpful, harmful, or just a harmless...








By Brett Bose  									It seems that the Energy Department, led by former Texas governor Rick Perry, is going full on anti-climate change. This time, however, instead of fighting actual global climate change, the government is launching a war on the truth that climate change exists.Energy Department staffers have to avoid even mentioning climate change so they don’t incur the wrath of the most anti-climate change administration America has ever seen.President Donald Trump and the Republican party are known for burying their heads in the sand when it comes to global warming. Trump believes it’s a Chinese hoax to make U.S. industry unprofitable, while Republicans refuse to accept even the notion that humans are responsible for the earth warming up – or that the warming will have disastrous consequences for humans.Now they’ve taken their denial one step further.POLITICO reports that staff at the Energy Department’s international climate office were told this week to avoid using the phrases “climate change,” “emissions reductions” or “Paris agreement.” The message was passed along in official memos, briefings or other written forms of communication.(“Paris agreement” refers to a groundbreaking international climate pact signed in 2016 by 194 countries, including the U.S.)The staff at the DOE’s Office of International Climate and Clean energy learned of the ban on certain phrases on Tuesday, the same day that Trump signed his Executive Order rolling back Obama’s environmental legacy.Senior officials informed staff that even simply using those phrases would cause a “visceral reaction” by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, as well as White House advisers who are now at the top of the department.The office is the only government department with “climate” in their name, and staff are concerned that, given the new President’s stance on the environment, their days are numbered since Trump is planning on reorganizing agencies. The office plays a key role in ensuring that the U.S. participates in international efforts to develop clean energy technology, a scheme set up by former President Obama.DOE sources told POLITICO that different offices received different memos, and some received no formal instructions at all, but have taken it upon themselves to avoid using climate-related phrases, replacing them with a rhetorical emphasis on words like “jobs” and “infrastructure.”A state Department official confirmed that there was a similar mood elsewhere in the government. They said:People are doing a lot of reading into tea leaves. People are taking their own initiatives to not use certain words based on hints from transition people. Everyone is encouraged to finding different ways of talking about things. There’s a sense that you’d better find a way to delink [from the previous administration’s talking points.]Liz Perera, the climate policy director at Sierra Club, issued a strongly-worded statement on the development:What exactly is this office supposed to call itself now? The international C****** office? Ignoring the climate crisis will not make it go away, will not create jobs in the booming clean energy economy, and will not make our country great.This episode belongs in a satirical drama, but sadly it’s real. We have now reached the point where Republicans are trying to make even the utterance of the words “climate change” a case of thought crime.No matter how much Republicans try, climate change can’t just be wished away. It’s real. It’s here. It’s going to wreak havoc with humanity for the foreseeable future. Republicans need to get unstick their heads from their backsides and start doing something about it instead of playing childish games and micromanaging.








According to theverge.com, a Kansas man was charged today after the fatal shooting of a Garmin engineer at a bar Wednesday night, police said.The suspect in the shooting, Adam Purinton, was drinking at the bar in Olathe, Kansas, at about 7:15PM that night, the Kansas City Star reported. A witness said he yelled “get out of my country” to two of the victims, reportedly saying the men, believed to originally be from India, were “Middle Eastern.”At a press conference, a local prosecutor said Purinton has been charged with one count of premeditated first degree murder, and two counts of attempted premeditated first degree murder. He is awaiting extradition to Kansas from Missouri, according to officials. An FBI official said the agency is investigating with local police. It’s unclear for now if Purinton will be charged with a federal hate crime. He is under a $2 million bond.Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an engineer at Garmin, was killed. Another victim injured in the shooting, Alok Madasani, also worked at Garmin. A third man, Ian Grillot, was also injured. Witnesses told the Star that Grillot was attempting to help the two other men after they were confronted. Officials said Madasani and Grillot have been treated and are in stable condition.Law enforcement officials said they were still in the early stages of investigating the crime, and could provide few details to confirm witness reports of the incident.Police found Purinton 80 miles away, five hours later, at a Clinton, Missouri Applebee’s. He allegedly told the bartender there about the shooting, according to the Star.“We’re saddened that two Garmin associates were involved in last night’s incident, and we express our condolences to the family and friends of our co-workers involved,” the company said in a statement to the paper. “Garmin will have grievance counselors on-site and available for its associates today and tomorrow.”“THERE IS A FEAR OF THE OTHER THAT HAS BEEN EXACERBATED DURING THE ELECTION.”Adam Hamilton, a pastor in the nearby community of Leawood, told The Verge that he feels “there is a fear of the other that has been exacerbated during the election.”He went on to note that Garmin is a huge source of pride in the area. In 2015, Garmin won approval from the Olathe City Council to expand its headquarters in hopes of doubling its 2,700 employee headcount. Hamilton said that some engineers employed at Garmin were part of the changing face of the community.“The diversity is increasing. It’s still small but it’s growing. A small contingent in my congregation are Indian. So I want people in our church to think about what things must be like for them right now. And to let them know that we are thinking of them.”








A fresh video from the Youtube channel entitled “Syria Future Agency” (سورية المستقبل) shows the recently liberated area of the National Hospital in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Syrian government forces took control of the area on December 4 and the video appeared on December 5.The video confirms that before its liberation the hospital had been used by the so-called “moderate opposition” as a military headquarters, a weapons depot and even a prison.The area with ammunition:The Syrian army also founds lots of various flags that suggest which militant factions controlled in the area and the level of their “moderatism”.A well known flag of the “moderate opposition”:Jaysh al-Islam is a coalition of Islamist and Salafist units.  It has well-known ties with Jabhat al-Nusra (the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda):Four Liwa al-Tawhid battalions in Aleppo joined child beheaders from Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki in October 2016:Variations of the Shahada flag are commonly used by various Jabhat al-Nusra-linked factions in Aleppo:The Levant Front is a coalition of various Salafi and Islamic factions allied with Jabhat al-Nusra:A high number of paper works and ID cards belonging to militants confirms that the hospital used to be a military HQ and even a Sharia court for a long time:Now it’s clear that at least some mainstream media reports about “Aleppo hospitals” destroyed by the “bloody Assad regime” could be true.https://vaskaxtumir.wordpress.com/2015/01/12/my-inaugural-page-2/We are being consistently lied to about the situation in East Aleppo.

The last thing the US/UK/Nato side wants is for their ‘advisers’ in East Aleppo to be caught alive. They may well now have been thrown under the bus to preserve their anonymity and the western pretence that the ‘rebels’ are plucky freedom fighters against  ‘barrelbombing, gassing, hospital destroying’ etc., Assad rather than nato backed mercenary fanatics.LikeLiked by 1 personThe western SF will have prepared escape routes well in advance, probably the first thing they sorted out. It was possibly via a specifically constructed long tunnel used for no other purpose. They will have had no qualms about killing any takfiris that knew about them. All they would need is a suitable diversion, such as a mass exodus of civilians and off they go. They will have tried to remove all evidence of their presence but there is always a degree of loss of control of information.LikeLikeTried to post this information in the graun just now.

No wonder the liberal left is so despised by so many ordinary people and their prestigeous publications are doomed financially. They choose to ignore reality and instead embrace a set of fantasies that bring them temporary comfort in their virtual Versaille, whilst outside people are getting angry at the way they are forced to live.LikeLiked by 1 personAccording to the WMSM most of the moderate Syrian opposition were busy running hospitals and schools while white hatted humanitarians saved children and families from barrel bombs and gas attacks by Russia and the Syrian army.All of this while their children were being kept there by parents who refused to leave while their houses were being bombed and obliterated as their children tweeted in fluent English and read Harry Potter books.Looks like the reality reported and pictured above is much different.I really must stop reading this fake news!LikeLikeWho cares!?

 Genetically Modified (GM) food is definitely not what it appears to be.










During Barack Hussein Obama’s sham of a presidency, he put millions of Americans on welfare and allowed them to freeload off the hard work of people who actually work for a living. Now that Donald Trump is in office, however, states are finally free to put a stop to this welfare nonsense once and for all.North Carolina recently decided to see what would happen if it’s welfare recipients had to be drug tested, and the results of this move were staggering. Of the 89 people who were picked for the test, 21 tested hot with drugs in their system, which shows just how many people are using our tax dollars to buy their narcotics.In addition, 70 people who were picked to the test decided to not show up at all, indicating that they also had drugs in their system and knew they would not pass the test.Given the results of this test, North Carolina is calling for all it’s welfare recipients to be drug tested. Though this seems like common sense that should be applied to welfare recipients all over the country, liberals are fighting these drug tests because they want as many people on welfare as possible.H/T Truth MonitorFrankly, we are sick of our hard-earned tax dollars being used to buy drugs. SHARE this story if you think drug testing should be MANDATORY for ALL welfare recipients!

April has arrived, which means that Israel’s cybersecurity community has its eyes set on the now-annual April 7 cyberattack by Anonymous and a group of anti-Israel hacktivists known as #OpIsrael.While the country is prepared for a variety of scenarios, most Israeli cybersecurity experts are unperturbed by the threat, since previous years have resulted in minimal damage.The attack has taken place every year on April 7 since 2013 and was first launched on the eve of the Holocaust Remembrance Day with a stated goal of erasing Israel from the Internet.“The nightmare scenario could be significant economical, political, social and reputational damage. Stock markets collapse, power goes off, nothing works. Obviously though it is possible, it is more science fiction that a real probable scenario. I expect to see almost no real damage.” said Menny Barzilay, a cyber security strategist and the former CISO of the Israel Defense Forces.Indicating a business-as-usual approach to this year’s attack, the city of Jerusalem is organizing a Cyber Hackathon this evening with 400 eager participants.The event simulates a worst case scenario attack on the city with essential computerized systems hacked, including traffic light failure, airplanes, power plant and other scenarios.“The teams will be given challenges which they will have to resolve in order to get everything back in order. Among the judges will be industry prominent figures and the whole event will be accompanied by mentors from leading cyber companies. The first three winners will be awarded one-on-one meetings with industry-leading mentors,” according to a press release.The ad hoc nature of the enemy, seemingly recruited from chat rooms, message boards, and internet forums may be one reason for the somewhat nonchalant response to the impending threat.Although anti-Israel hackers operate under the guise of the Anonymous brand, it would be misleading to portray the situation as an all out war between Israel and Anonymous.“Since Anonymous is more an idea than a group it is hard to tell who is part of Anonymous and how is not. Different people, with different goals and incentives are assuming the anonymous brand name in order to support their action. This is why you see both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups using the Anonymous brand while fighting each other,” said Barzilay.While the government, banks and other major institutions are prepared, smaller sites with fewer resources might have a tougher time fending off the attackers.“Large organizations will be prepared for the attack. They will scale up their staff and pay closer attention to alerts. They are already working with their security vendors and service providers to make sure that everything is up to date. The real victims will be the small organizations that do not have sophisticated security operations or even lack an understanding of the layers that they need to have in place. They face the risk of defacement of their brands or even breaches,” said Gil Barak, the CTO and Co-Founder of SECDO.“In a nightmare scenario, attackers would affect the day-to-day lives of Israelis and the financial health of Israeli companies–attackers could do that by causing downtime in one of Israel’s few critical dairy or bread factories, for example, “ said Yoni Shohet, CEO and cofounder of SCADAfence.Israel prepares for #OpIsrael cyberattack | TechCrunch








New policy will increase deportations among undocumented immigrants.The Department of Homeland Security has a new policy for increasing immigration enforcement.  The policy is intended to identify, capture, and deport as quickly as possible any undocumented immigrant encountered anywhere by Immigration and Customs enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents. The new approach means that no undocumented immigrant is safe from deportation.Under the new policy, any undocumented immigrant anywhere in the U.S. who arrived in the past two years can be deported. Priorities for deportation have been expanded to now include any undocumented immigrant who is convicted of any crime, no matter how minor, or who has been charged with a crime, or who has committed an act for which they could be charged.Adrian Florida of National Public Radio explained that “Because immigrants can technically face charges for entering the country illegally, [the policy makes any undocumented immigrant] a deportation priority just by virtue of being present.” Joanne Lin, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that “due process, human decency, and common sense are treated as inconvenient obstacles on the path to mass deportation.”In efforts to avoid attracting the attention of immigration officials, undocumented immigrants are altering their routines. Some immigrant parents have signed legal documents so that in the event they are arrested by immigration agents, their relatives or friends are authorized to pick up their children from school and to access their bank accounts to pay their bills. Some carry wallet-size “Know Your Rights” guides in Spanish and English that explain what to do, or not do, if they’re arrested. Others start making phone calls when someone doesn’t come home on time.Many immigrants have said they were afraid to drive; some are cautious about using public transit. Most look through the window if anyone knocks. Fewer day laborers stand on street corners looking for work. Some students have dropped out of school. Some low-income families have not re-enrolled in a food-assistance program. Church attendance is problematic, as are grocery shopping and medical appointments.Immigrant advocates have advised immigrants not to answer questions about where they were born or about their immigration status. They’re also advised that if a knock comes, it is acceptable to slide a card under the door. Printed on one side of the card is the message, “To Whom It May Concern: Before answering any questions, I want to talk to an attorney.” One lawyer, advising immigrants to take steps to protect themselves, said, “Do not open the door to your home without seeing a warrant. Do not drive a car with broken tail lights. Do not drive at all at night.”The Pew Research Center reports that in 2014, 11.1 million people were living in the U.S. illegally; 8 million of these people were in the labor force; and 66% of them had lived in the U.S. for at least ten years. More than half of the undocumented workers that year were from Mexico, 15 % were from Central America, and 13% were from Asia. Last Year, 242,255 immigrants were deported.

A conservative preacher and vocal supporter of President Donald Trump shared claims an “anointed” cake “saved” a gay bartender. Lance Wallnau was answering a question via a Periscope session from a viewer who wanted to stop her son from being gay, according to a video that Right Wing Watch posted online. In response, he shared the story of “hookers” who got “saved” and wanted to help a bar owner “who was gay and very adamantly anti-Christian.” So they baked him a cake and prayed over it, he said. “It was an anointed cake,” Wallnau said. “The power of God hit him while he was eating the cake.” Wallnau claimed the bar owner felt “the presence of God” while eating the cake and underwent some kind of transformation and was eventually baptized.To make matters even more ludicrous, the preacher also announced that he conducted extensive research and managed to obtain the recipe for the “anointed cake,” which he then decided he would “patent and market to the religiously-challenged Americans.” “I have to admit, the idea didn’t come to me right away,” Wallnau said in an interview with the Dallas Morning Star. “As a matter of fact, it actually dawned on me while I was watching an old Jerry Springer re-run online. It was about a family who was nearly devastated by drugs and the father’s homosexual infidelity, but they were somehow able to find God and reunite. That’s when it hit me that there’s an entire market out there screaming for a quick fix, for something that’s able to save normal people from the plague of gays.”He continued, “After doing some serious digging, I was able to come up with the recipe for the cake, which I’ve decided to patent and then possibly license to other church-endorsed businesses willing to join the battle against homosexualism. We have to be honest here – there are a lot of fallen Christians in this country, and a significant portion of them are simultaneously in the claws of the homosexual plague. We need a game changer here, something that’s going to tip the scales. I am confident that the anointed cake is it; we just need to market it properly. Because, at the end of the day, it’s still a product like any other and the owner of the patent, which is to say, yours truly, still needs to make a living regardless of his nobility.”Asked to elaborate on how the cake works, Wallnau explained that it “protects normal people” from gays by making them extremely unattractive. “Now, I know what the nay-sayers are going to be on about here. ‘How’s that different from any other cake that makes people fat?’ or something or other. Well, the Anointed Cake not only makes people fat, but it also provides a one-of-a-kind religious experience to those who taste it. They are purified by it – I mean that both figuratively and literally, since in addition to bringing a person closer to God, it also brings them closer to the toilet, due to the fact that laxative is one of it’s main ingredients. When you add acne, diabetes and oily skin into the mix as well, it becomes clear that the anointed cake is by far the most powerful weapon in the war against gay people. And the best part is, you only have to eat it for two weeks before seeing the first results,” the preacher concluded.  








Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan clearly failed both President Donald Trump and the American people when he sabotaged Trump’s attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare with something far better.This effort blew up in Rep. Ryan’s face, and many leading figures including Fox News’ Judge Jeanine Pirro have publicly called on Ryan to resign from his Speaker position so that Trump will have someone in that leadership position who will actually do productive work with him. Many have speculated who that replacement could be, and they just got their answer.Stated an insider with close ties to Trump to Breitbart, “This is another example of the staff not serving the president well and the weakness of the Paul Ryan speakership. This calls into question once again the speaker’s commitment to supporting Donald Trump and his agenda.”Added another source, “Speaker Ryan proved today that he does not have the best interests of the President at heart. He sold out the president and showed his word can be taken with a grain of salt. There is only one course of action that should be taken to move past this catastrophe and that is the swift removal of Paul Ryan from the speakership.”According to reports, Trump is considering replacing Speaker Ryan with either House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows or House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Who do you think President Trump should choose?Source:conservative101.com

When it comes to whether the Trump administration has questionable ties to Russia, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul admitted Tuesday that he’s not interested in finding out – even as the controversy surrounding Michael Flynn continues to boil over.Why? Because it’s not “useful” for Republicans to investigate other Republicans.The Kentucky senator made the comments in a Fox News radio interview when he was asked about Sen. John McCain’s recent calls for an investigation into the Trump administration’s ties to Moscow.His remarks:I think that might be excessive. I think it looks like the President has handled the situation and unless there’s some kind of other evidence of malfeasance, this sounds like something that was internal White House politics and it looks like the President’s handled it. … I just don’t think it’s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party. We’ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing Obamacare if we’re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense.Besides the fact that Paul essentially admitted that only Democrats should be subject to investigations, there are three things particularly troubling about his comments:1. He thinks the President has “handled the situation.”First and foremost, Trump has known for weeks that Michael Flynn was lying about his interactions with Russia. If Paul’s definition of handling a situation is to force Flynn to resign only after the story gets widespread media attention then, certainly, Trump has “handled the situation.”2. He doesn’t think it’s “useful to be doing investigation after investigation.”Really? Where was the Kentucky senator when Republicans in Congress were wasting taxpayer dollars doing “investigation after investigation” into the non-scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton and Benghazi? How about her emails? Now, after a legitimate scandal surfaces and prompts bipartisan outrage, he’s grown tired of investigating things.3. Investigating the Trump administration’s ties to Russia is distracting the GOP from repealing Obamacare. Instead of being concerned that an incoming administration was working with a foreign state and undermining American national security prior to even taking office, Sen. Paul is concerned that this whole mess will distract Congress from taking health insurance away from more than 20 million Americans.For a Senator that has, at times, shown himself to be a refreshing and independent voice within the Republican Party, his comments on Tuesday were shameful.  Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, Moscow, Russia, vladimir putinFollow Sean Colarossi on TwitterRand Paul Opposes Russia Probe Because Republicans Shouldn’t Investigate Republicans added by Sean Colarossi on Tue, Feb 14th, 2017View all posts by Sean Colarossi →








Bernie Sanders threw away a historic chance to establish a popular and strong alternative to two deeply flawed, establishment candidates from the two main parties.“I won’t stay silent if Clinton nominates the same old Wall Street guys,” Sanders sad this week. “The leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people. We won 22 states and 46 percent of the pledged delegates, 13.4 million votes and a majority of the younger people who represent the future of the country. That gives me a lot of leverage that I intend to use.”But leading protests and stirring up trouble in the Senate might be all that’s left for Bernie Sanders to contest a Clinton administration that, as is expected, should diverge from her public embrace of some Sanders’ positions once her hand is lifted from the inaugural Bible.He said he’s begun to draft some of his planks in the Democratic platform into legislation: minimum wage, on climate change and breaking up big banks. But given what we now know for sure about what the Clinton machine thinks of him, it’s debatable how much leverage he has.It’s not hard to imagine Sanders contemplating what could have been as he sees the two most unpopular candidates in modern history beset by ever deepening scandals: Trump from exposure of alleged sexual misconduct and Clinton from Wikileaks e-mail revelations.Sanders now knows for certain how the Democratic National Committee conspired to defeat him when it was supposed to remain neutral. And he knows from Wikileaks’ disclosure of Clinton’s Wall Street speeches, which he repeatedly demanded she make public, what she really thinks of ordinary Americans and how cozy she is with plutocrats.In the context of these revelations, is it not reasonable to assume that if Sanders had taken Jill Stein’s offer to head the Green Party ticket that such a team would have gotten 15% in the polls and a place at the debates? Wouldn’t Sanders’ presence at the debates have given an alternative to voters who detest both Trump and Clinton and at least a chance to build a viable third party movement?Sanders said he supports Clinton because an independent run would have handed the election to Trump. “I don’t want to end up like Ralph Nader,” Sanders told journalist Chris Hedges. Nader is blamed, unfairly, for handing the 2000 election to George W. Bush over Al Gore with his Green Party run.But it is questionable whether Sanders would have divided the Clinton vote to make Trump president. Millions of angry voters from an eroding middle class could have supported Sanders instead of Trump. In other words, Sanders could have taken away just as many and perhaps more votes from Trump, as both were insurgency candidates against the Establishment’s choice.Sanders who hasn’t even a whiff of corruption about him might well be soaring above both of them in the polls by now.It also appears that Sanders made his decision to support Clinton almost wholly based on domestic issues, which he focused nearly exclusively on during his primary campaign.  On climate change, gun control, immigration and a number of other issues, Sanders aligns with Clinton rather than Trump.Sanders rightly feared Trump’s xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia, misogyny and demagoguery.  But he is overlooked his conciliatory approach to Russia and Clinton’s warmongering. Given Sanders’ critique of Clinton’s love of regime change, hope for peace would have been greater, though not ensured, with Sanders rather than Clinton.Sanders had an historic opportunity and obligation in the face of the ruin of the American middle class and the danger of looming global conflict, but he failed to seize it. He either did not take seriously or understand the urgency of the situation nor the meaning of “revolution,” which is to upend the status quo, not to go along with it. Given his outburst this week, he might well be regretting his decision. commentsBernie Sanders responds to his supporters who feel betrayed by his endorsement of Hillary Clinton.

The election is over but it seems like Hillary still hasn’t learned her lesson. She sent an email that blamed president Comey for her loss. Kellyanne Conway has a powerful message for her.“I think it’s unfortunate for Secretary Clinton, who is a woman of enormous gifts and talents. And she should be commended for putting herself out there and running for president twice,” Conway started.“I just can’t believe it’s always somebody else’s fault. Sometimes you just have to take a look in the mirror and reflect on what went wrong,” she continued.“What about the fact that they just got it wrong? What about the fact they weren’t in touch with Americans, and the culture zeitgeist, and what motivates many Americans?”“They misread America. They did not have her in red states. They were pretending they were going to turn red blue. They were pretending,” said Conway.

Press Secretary Sean Spicer told a reporter, “Stop shaking your head” in a daily White House press briefing on Tuesday. Spicer berated veteran African-American reporter April Ryan after she had asked him a question regarding the Trump administration’s ties to Russia.During the exchange, Spicer grew visibly agitated, and at some point snapped and said: “I’m sorry that disgusts you. You’re shaking your head.” Later in the exchange, he charged, “I’m sorry, please stop shaking your head again.”Other reporters were appalled and slammed Spicer for his patronizing put-down of Ryan: 
Later, Ryan graciously told CNN, “You know, at the end of the day, I’m a reporter; he’s a press secretary. We both have jobs to do. I’m going back today to do my job, and he’s going to do his job. And I’ll take it for what it is. And as the administration is calling us the enemy of the people — I guess we saw some of that thought process yesterday.”  








Watermelon fields in eastern China are covered in exploded fruit. Farmers used growth chemicals to make their crops bigger, but ended up destroying them instead.The farmers used the growth accelerator forchlorfenuron. Even the melons that survived tended to have fibrous, misshapen fruit with mostly white instead of black seeds.MSNBC reports:“Chinese regulations don’t forbid use of the substance. It is also allowed in the United States for use on kiwi fruit and grapes … About 20 farmers and 115 acres of watermelon around Danyang were affected … Farmers resorted to chopping up the fruit and feeding it to fish and pigs”. This may sound like a joke, but it’s real alright. Seems the use of a chemical growth accelerator, forchlorfenuron, has been implicated in the widespread “exploding melon” phenomena. Forchlorfenuron is a so-called “plant growth regulator,” registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2004 for use on grapes, raisins, and kiwis. According to the EPA Pesticide Fact sheet, the chemical is to be applied to the flowers and/or developing fruit during early post-bloom to improve fruit size, fruit set, cluster weight, and cold storage. The fact sheet explains that the chemical “acts synergistically with natural auxins to promote plant cell division and lateral growth.”According to MSNBC, the Chinese farmers incorrectly applied forchlorfenuron to the fruit “during overly wet weather and… too late in the season, which made the melons burst.”Indeed. Melons have been exploding by the acre.Another article published on May 24 by The Epoch Times, specified that the seeds used were “quality watermelon seeds” imported from Japan. Of the 20 farmers in the affected Chinese province, 10 of them used these imported Japanese seeds. It’s unclear whether all of the farmers whose crops blew up had also used forchlorfenuron.But ruptured melon-heads are not the most concerning aspect of this story. There’s also the question of consumer safety. Although no specific health hazards are mentioned in any of the articles covering this story, they do allude to the fact that there may be cause for health concerns. MSNBC writes:“The report quoted Feng Shuangqing, a professor at the China Agricultural University, as saying the problem showed that China needs to clarify its farm chemical standards and supervision to protect consumer health. the report underscores how farmers in China are abusing both legal and illegal chemicals, with many farms misusing pesticides and fertilizers.”Forchlorfenuron is in fact legal, both in China and in the US. But should it be? According to the EPA pesticide fact sheet, forchlorfenuron is not necessarily harmless, neither to the environment nor to animals and potentially humans. Side effects revealed in animal studies included:They also categorize forchlorfenuron as “moderately toxic to freshwater fish on an acute basis.” One of the tell-tale signs of a fruit or vegetable that hasn’t been grown by entirely natural means is their inherent lack of flavor. It may look plump and ripe, but once you bite into it, it’s anything but a flavor sensation. This is because while growth enhancers like forchlorfenuron stimulate cell division, making the fruit grow faster, it also drains it of flavor. This is actually rather logical, if you think about it. Flavor is a sign of ripeness, which only comes with time. Many unripe fruits and vegetables are virtually tasteless.In the case of watermelons, those treated with forchlorfenuron are very large and brightly colored on the outside, but the color of the flesh is more white than deep red. Other telltale signs are white instead of black seeds and fibrous, and/or misshapen fruit. (Note, this is for regular watermelons, which have black seeds. Seedless watermelons typically have tiny white seeds.)This is an area that doesn’t get much press. While many are now aware of the fact that CAFO raised meats are loaded with hormones, few would imagine that fresh produce would be laced with hormone additives as well. But they are. According to Zheng Fengtian, a professor of agriculture from Renmin University, hormones can increase yields by 20 percent or more, and are therefore “widely used.”Some of these hormones you might never expect to make their way onto your plate, such as oxytocin—a hormone that acts as a neuromodulator in your brain; often referred to as “the love hormone,” or “bonding hormone.” It’s released naturally in large amounts in a woman’s body during childbirth, but has also been synthesized biochemically and is available as a prescription drug to induce labor—and is, apparently, being illegally injected into fruits and vegetables in some countries…Last summer, an Indian health minister, Dinesh Trivedi, warned about the illegal use of oxytocin in fruits and vegetables in India. Apparently the hormone allows produce to gain weight and ripen sooner. Injected produce also appear plumper and fresher.According to Trivedi, the hormone is being used on:FoodSafety.com also reported that the drug, although banned for public sale in India, was widely available from fertilizer and pesticide vendors. Potential side effects of consuming oxytocin-laced produce include:Other growth promoting agents used in fruits and vegetables include:While ethylene is considered GRAS (generally recognized as safe), calcium carbide “may contain traces of arsenic and phosphorus, both highly toxic to humans,” according to one industry source, and most countries do not allow its use.Interestingly enough, one of the Chinese farmers whose melons exploded reportedly used a formula containing a mixture of growth enhancers, sweetening agents, and “a calcium solution.” So it’s not clear whether the formula used on the exploding fruits contained calcium carbide in conjunction with the forchlorfenuron. Whatever the case may be, the results are clearly not good. If you’re still vacillating on the issue of going organic, I hope this information spurs you into action.If you eat conventionally grown produce, not only are you exposing yourself and your family to a variety of pesticides; you may also get hormones and chemical growth promoters—all of which have the potential to devastate your health, especially that of young children. Remember, conventional produce sold in your local supermarket comes from all over the world! So you cannot brush off this information as being a potential threat affecting just the region in which the produce was grown.Organic foods also contain higher amounts of nutrients, so you’re getting “more bang for your buck,” when seen from a nutrition standpoint. One four-year long European-Union-funded study found that:Last but not least, if you’re any kind of food aficionado, meaning if you like flavor, organic foods simply cannot be beat. When it comes to produce, your absolute best bet is locally-grown organics. That’s truly the best of both worlds. However, if you can’t find locally grown organics, opt for USDA certified organic, but not imported organic, over the conventionally grown variety. Just be aware that wilted organic produce is not going to provide the nutrition that a fresh one will, even if it’s conventionally grown, so freshness is also key.There are some exceptions to the all-organic rule, which may be welcome news if you cannot afford to buy everything organic. For more information on which conventionally-grown produce are the safest, please see my previous article 12 Foods You Don’t Have to Buy Organic. My personal view of why you’d want an organic lifestyle is that although you may spend more money on organic food today, your payoff of good health should more than make up for it – and reduce your health care costs in the future. It makes sense to me to invest a little bit more now so I can avoid paying LARGE medical bills later on, but more importantly, I can avoid the physical and mental disability and dysfunction that inevitably follows from a careless, unhealthy lifestyle.Making sure you’re not being misled by labels in your search for a healthier lifestyle is unfortunately part of this process. However, by educating yourself about what to look for, talking to your grocer, and sharing information with family, friends and neighbors, you can help the movement toward healthier food choices. comments








 By the end of the 40-hour work week, we’re over-worked and exhausted. We barely have any time to ourselves, save the meager few hours in the evenings. Most of us lose our identities in the process, forgetting our hobbies, interests, and simple pleasures in life. We’re in such a rush to fit everything into our schedules, working towards the next big purchase, that we don’t stop to enjoy our lives. And yet we keep working long hours, never thinking to question it. Meanwhile, corporations get richer and debt skyrockets.  Inflation is what happens when the value of a dollar is raised. When the US government needs money to wage whatever kind of war, they ask the Federal Reserve for a loan. From here, the Fed buys bonds (essentially, IOU’s) from the government in whatever amount the government requested. The government then prints out treasury bonds, while the Fed prints money. The two trade, and the government deposits this money into a different bank, which charges fees and interest. And there you have it. The creation of money out of nothing.This process decreases the worth of a dollar, causing inflation and driving the country more and more into debt.Debt Because the amount of debt continues to grow, it gives the impression that we will never get out of it. Because more debt means more money circulation, even if we were able to pay off the entirely of our loans, this means there wouldn’t be a single dollar in circulation. And don’t forget about needing to pay off the interest, as well. After all, the cost of living continues to increase along with the debt. It’s this kind of orchestration that causes the majority of us to panic and automatically accept the 40-hour work week without question.But is the 40 hour-work week all that efficient? Studies show that out of an 8-hour day, workers only accomplish less than 3 hours of actual work . Still, somehow corporate profits are flying through the roof as wages are declining. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , in the 3rd quarter this year, productivity increased 2.3 percent, while hourly pay only increased by 1.3 percent. Never in the past 85 years has corporate profiting been so high. But do we ever stop to think why we aren’t being paid more and working less?Consumerism Consumerism is defined by dictionary.com as “the fact or practice of an increasing consumption of goods.” Meaning, consumerism is generally accepted as a positive thing. And in the past, when the economy was doing better, it truly was. However, with the amount of debt on the rise, in addition to inflation, consumerism has taken a negative toll on society. The more money we spend, the more we feed the corporations and banks who profit off our economic slavery. It’s a deadly cycle.For hundreds of years, corporations have pushed a “buy, buy, buy” mentality. They’ve taken advantage of people by using consumerism as a profit-making tool, delving into our subconscious desires and exploiting them. They offer amazing deals like “buy now, pay later” or “charge it”! Which essentially means, “Spend money you don’t have!” These days, Americans don’t even blink as they fork over their credit cards, financing everything with empty pockets. And don’t forget the Keeping up with the Joneses mentality, or needing the newest, biggest, fastest, and greatest new products. Corporations thrive off of this, and the 40-hour work week only solidifies it.Because we’re at work for the majority of the day, we spend our limited evenings and days off watching television or other forms of media and entertainment, many times because we simply don’t have time for other activities we’d better enjoy. And on top of this, most of us are still struggling to make ends meet. We buy frivolous things for fleeting moments of happiness before we grow bored and move on. We hide our insecurities, psychological needs, and issues with material items – things that are advertised to us constantly within the few hours a night we get to ourselves. We pay for convenience because we can’t afford not to. And the corporations keep getting richer.

Deep concerns about safety are raised once again following Okanagan Specialty Fruits recent announcement that their genetically modified non-browning Arctic® Golden sliced apples will be placed in select midwestern U.S. stores starting in early 2017.  Watch for Arctic® Golden sliced apples in the cooler section with other grab-and-go packaged fruit and veggie snacks.In an interview for Capital Press, Neal Carter, the company’s founder and president, said the apple slices will be in 10 stores this February, but he declined to identify which stores.About 500, 40-pound boxes of sliced apples will be sold in grab-and-go pouch bags, he said. The company expects to offer 6,000 boxes of apple slices from the 2017 fall crop.  The company has orchards in British Columbia and 85,000 trees at an undisclosed location in Washington state. More than 300,000 trees will be planted this spring and 500,000 are being budded for planting in 2018.A QR computer scan code on the packaging will be used to provide consumer information, including the fact that the apple slices are genetically modified; otherwise nothing on the package directly identifies the product as GMO.To accomplish the non-browning effect, scientists at Okanagan Specialty Fruits introduced genetically engineered genes that make their apples produce double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to shut off the browning genes.  The question that serious scientists are asking is: If we (or bees, or birds, or deer) consume the dsRNA in the apple, can it influence how our genes work? Will these genetically modified organisms (GMOs) change our development, physiology, and behavior? For an in-depth look at existing research and overview of the dsRNA modification, see the article by Jeffrey Smith, Why Scientists are Worried about the GMO Potato and Apple.  








Troy is a game veteran of a decade's standing, and a lover of women, literature, travel and freedom. He is also the author of The Seven Laws of Seduction. Visit his website at Troy Francis.Coming into game and understanding inter-gender dynamics is an eye-opener for many men, and it takes some longer than others to understand what the best strategies available are to those who want to improve their success with women. When people find out that I write about game for a living they will often ask what my best ‘chat up’ line is, failing to understand that the ‘opener’ is really just that, an opener. No single line is ever strong enough to get a woman into bed immediately (unless that line is ‘I am Justin Bieber’).But if they asked me what my best overall strategy for meeting women was, I would say that it is flipping the script. In fact, it is only by learning to flip the scrip proficiently that you will start to see incremental gains in your success with girls over time as well as in your social standing.Think about how social interactions between men and women are usually calibrated for a moment. As you will be aware, the whole set up in Western society positions the woman as the dominant actor with the man a kind of underdog who must kow-tow to her, bring her gifts and entertain her in order to be in with a chance of vaginal access with her.The concept of courtly love, which was identified by writers and historian in the 19th century but was actually operational from 1099 or so in France, was a highly stylised form of courtship where knights were encouraged to undertake acts of extreme bravery in order to win the hearts of the ladies they were enamoured of. Unbelievably, poets actually declared themselves ‘vassals’ of their lady, even addressing her as maidens, or ‘my lord.’ So subjugated were men at this point that they actually referred to women in the masculine. And you thought guys being cucked was something new!This notion of the female as a superior being whose affections can only be obtained through male supplication has infused literature, art, music and film ever since. It is so deep-rooted in our culture as to be almost indomitable. And today, in the age of selfies and Instagram, with thirsty men liking each and every attention-whoring post that gets put up, day or night, you might reasonably argue that its fever pitch has only increased. It is for this reason that flipping the script is more important than ever for gaining cut-through in a competitive sexual marketplace.Flipping the Script is defined like this:Reversing the usual or existing positions in a situation; doing something unexpected or revolutionary.It has been part of pick-up phraseology for many years now, along with another, related concept: ‘You are the prize.’ Basically, when it comes to dealing with women, the idea is simply that you must refuse to except the frame of the underdog and instead go into every interaction with the unstated assumption that you as the guy are the dominant party, and she should be the one who proves herself worthy of you.Of course, this sounds very simple in outline, but how do you actually go about putting it into practice? It’s not easy, especially since you are effectively pushing back against centuries of social conditioning and the conventional operating system that scaffolds our culture.But it is precisely for these reasons that flipping the script works so well. Think about this for a moment. Who are the guys who are walking around now who are naturally unintimidated by hot girls, and who are naturally uncowed by them? Very rich, very handsome, very high-value alpha males. Pop stars, billionaire playboys, members of the Saudi royal family, rappers, actors. You get the idea.Now if a hot girl is treated in an offhand manner by one of the above, do you think she’s going to be surprised or mad? No, of course she isn’t. Recognising that such a man is higher value than her, she will naturally expect him to be off-hand with her, perhaps even rude. Why? Because he’s special and unique and she isn’t. You think a really hot girl, a 9, expects Justin Bieber to be nice to her off the bat? No she doesn’t, because she knows that, however hot she is, his social capital as a world-famous celebrity is infinitely higher than hers. So when he is rude to her at the stage door after a concert she will only try harder to impress him, so much so she’ll actually be grateful if he finally deigns to have sex with her.Here’s the thing. The social convention of guys having to be supplicating to girls in order to get into their pants is actually extremely useful to women. Not only does it mean they get free drinks, dinners, cars, holidays to Dubai and so on, but it also means that they are able to discern the real high-value men from the fake.A really high value man, like Bieber, might choose to lavish a girl with gifts, but he wouldn’t have to in order to sleep with her. In fact, most girls would think it weird if he did. Can you imagine? ‘Hi, it’s Justin. I bought you these flowers because I think you’re really nice.’ It would be entirely incongruent. All Justin has to say is three words—‘Room 1895 now’—in order to get girls in his bed: and they know it.Now, we can take advantage of this phenomenon to our benefit, because when you start acting with the imperious disdain of a rock star then girls are naturally going to be curious. OK, a few might laugh and call into question your right to be so cocky. But even so, they will wonder. ‘How come this guy is acting so dismissive of me? There must be something about him.’ As I have said before, you don’t necessarily have to be a high-value stone cold alpha off the bat. If you can take on some of the habits and attitudes of the alpha then you will find yourself being put into that category by default, since girls by-and-large just aren’t used to low value guys acting like that,How to do it? That could be the subject of a whole book. The most obvious tool at your disposal is ‘fake it ’til you make it‘. To misquote the acting professor Stanislavsky, you should ‘act as if’. Try to imagine what Bieber (or whoever else you’d like to emulate) would do as he walked down this street or came into contact with girls in this club. How would he look at them? How would he speak to them? What would he say? What would his tonality be like? What would his body language look like? How would his eye contact and gestures be?If you want to get specific, go on to YouTube and study whoever it is you’re thinking of for some tips. Then practice acting just like that. Another tool that has been very useful to me over the years is defiance. I was a classic hard-case beta who simply refused to live my life in that way. Years ago I used to shrink into the corner in nightclubs afraid to make eye contact. Now, friends and colleagues tease me for my walk, which they call a strut—they say I walk around like I own the place, which I do.My voice is a loud and strong, my eye contact is good and if anything I have to tone down my natural ebullience and confidence when I meet people in order not to dominate proceedings. This is not to big myself up, but merely to indicate that you can change and adopt high-value behaviours—and a great way to spark that process off is by getting angry with yourself and refusing to behave like a little bitch any longer.One note of caution: if you are at a less than optimal stage in other areas of your life, then simply flipping the script on its own may not deliver you miraculous results. What I mean is this. If you walk around the club acting like a rock star when actually you’re broke, overweight and dressed badly then of course people are going to see through that. Now, perhaps Jack Black walks around the club like that and still gets laid (although of course he’s not broke) but he also has a ton of social proof backing him up.So my message, as always, is that as with any game tool, as you use it you must also simultaneously look to raise your real sexual market value in all other areas. You should be reading books, you should be going to the gym, you should be eating right, dressing well and so on. But simply by adopting the mental and behavioural habit of flipping the script, I promise you will start to see positive changes in the ways girls react to you.Want to find out more about how to attract hot girls in today’s market?

I grew up in a completely non-political family. We never discussed politics, there was nothing to influence my decisions. I came to the Democratic party growing up in the 90’s. I saw a local party that inspired me to cast my first votes when the time came around.The same party that I often volunteered my time to in college, even serving as my campus Young Democrat president for a while. The same party that I loaded up in a van with to walk the streets of Oklahoma City to campaign for the hometown Presidential candidate Wesley Clark. The same party that I attended countless meetings, fund-raisers, dinners, and rallies.The Democratic Party of Arkansas that once inspired me is no more. What remains today is a fragment of the former self, and with every election cycle the memories of what once was the great party of Arkansas fades into darkness a little more.Sure, Democrats will be elected on Tuesday. Congressional candidates Pat Hays and James Lee Witt both stand a good shot at election along with a number of down ticket candidates. Make no mistake, this is not a grand resurgence. This is the last dance at the ball.Both Witt and Hays come in with extremely large name recognition. In the 90’s and 2000’s we would be looking at a 20+ point victory, not a virtual tossup, at this point.The telling races are those like Attorney General where the Leslie Rutledge self destructed, almost is kicked off the ballot, and then has racist and sexist comments appear from emails, yet leads in pre-election polling. Or State Treasurer where Republican candidate Dennis Milligan attempted to black mail his primary opponent and yet will still likely win a position where the previous elected official was kicked out for scandal.In fact it feels a bit like the opposite position the Democrats found themselves in during the 90’s where a candidate with a D next to their name were almost a lock to win. Often no matter how bad the candidate. It is that complacency going into the late 90’s and 2000’s that led in large part to the change. It moved elections from being an automatic win to a complete tossup.In those changing tossup years it became Mike Beebe who rose to become the face of the party. Beebe’s popularity kept the balance as close as it is today in state politics, even when the large ticket races of Senators and Congressmen began falling for the party.With Beebe’s departure the Democrats are left largely without an identity, and certainly without a charismatic leader who can connect back with the voters. The party as a whole feels lost and unorganized. Instead of inspiring voters to believe in a greater hope, Democrats spend their time trying to convince voters that they are as different from the Democratic party as possible.Pride has given way to shame. Inspiring voters has become begging for any attention. Building a vision is now building a wall.Even the Clinton spark is long gone. From all the campaigning the former Governor and President spent around the the state, most candidates saw no measurable bump. In fact Lt. Governor Candidate John Burkhalter likely received more of a rise in polling numbers due to admitting he was at one point a male stripper than came from the Clinton campaigning. Take that for whatever puns you want.Politics like most other things in the world have cycles. The Democratic party is not dead, it will certainly have a rise again. However it is quickly looking like it may be time to turn out the lights and go to bed. See you all in the morning.It is easy to talk to those inside the party and believe this is not the case. No one wants to give up hope. But take a step back and look at the general election movements and the picture is becoming clear. Voters are shifting their pattern in large numbers.So what can the Democrats do to rise from the impending slumber?I think we need to see a true identity that is more about relating back with voters. The stances of the party today seem more about trying to not be anything that may offend a voter and less about being something meaningful to voters.The party needs a strong figure to lead the party. Someone who can inspire both voters and party members.Look, the numbers do not look bad for Democrats. The most recent Arkansas Poll from UA shows voters identifying themselves 28% Republican, 31% Democratic, and 33% independent. Now the independent voters lean Republican, but there is clearly room for a Democrat who can come in and first rally that 31% to get off their ass and vote and then second inspire about half of the independent voters to vote for them.The problem is I look around the top-level candidates and if the average registered voter had to choose between going to vote for them and contracting Ebola, I think Ebola might look like the more inspiring option right now. It reminds me of the 2004 election with John Kerry. I voted less because I really wanted Kerry President and more that I didn’t want Bush. For a candidate on the fence they are less likely to get out and vote.Can anyone tell me they are really inspired to vote for Pryor? For Ross?Where as for the people he is targeting, Cotton is inspiring his target audience to get out and vote. I am not sure against a strong Democratic candidate that could rally voters Cotton has enough supporters to pull it off. But against a candidate that reminds me a bit of Eeyore looking for his tail, I think Cotton ends up winning decisively. There is a good chance that Asa has been asleep since July, but the same voters moving to vote for Cotton will also vote for Asa and carry that election as well, but slightly lower numbers.Unless this changes in the next election cycle, this is likely the last dance for a while of the Democratic party of Arkansas. One last waltz before it is time to go home.Last one out get the lights.








Russia and China accelerate local currency cooperationMoscow and Beijing took another step towards de-dollarization with the announcement of the opening of a renminbi clearing bank in Russia on Wednesday. Local currency transactions were first used in both countries' border regions. Today, more and more Chinese and Russian financial institutes and enterprises are using local currencies to invest and settle accounts, as the yuan-ruble trade platform is becoming more established and the transaction network is expanding amid deepening China-Russia economic and financial cooperation.The yuan clearing bank in Moscow will greatly accelerate trade in local currencies: Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) officially started operating as a Chinese renminbi (CNY) clearing bank in Russia Wednesday, a move set to facilitate the use of the currency and cooperation in various fields between the two countries."Under the guidance of the governments and central banks of both countries, ICBC's Moscow branch will effectively fulfill its responsibility and obligation as a renminbi clearing bank by taking further advantage of its leading edge in renminbi businesses, providing customers with safe, high quality and convenient clearing services," said Hu Hao, ICBC's deputy governor, at the opening ceremony."Financial regulatory authorities of China and Russia have signed a series of major agreements, which marks a new level of financial cooperation," said Dmitry Skobelkin, deputy governor of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation."The launching of renminbi clearing services in Russia will further expand local settlement business and promote financial cooperation between the two countries," the official added.With the continuous deepening of the Russia-China comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination in recent years, the two countries are now starting to enhance local currency cooperation.At the end of 2015, the Russian central bank announced the inclusion of the renminbi in its national foreign exchange reserves, making it Russia's officially recognized reserve currency.During Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China in June last year, the central banks of the two countries signed a memorandum of cooperation in starting renminbi clearing services in Russia, just three months before ICBC's Moscow branch was appointed by China's central bank as the clearing house for settling renminbi transactions there.

It's no secret that Russia and China have employed a number of methods to slowly wean themselves off dollar dependency.Russia became China's largest energy exporter in February of last year after it agreed to accept payment in yuan. The dollar is slowly losing its privileged place in international transactions. We're sure Washington is less than thrilled.

This prank has been a tradition on the incoming president from the previous president since Andrew Jackson.White House historian, Kevin Smith, told The Washington Post, “It’s a White House tradition that Obama promises to continue. There have been funny reactions from the prank over the years. Carter stared at the turd and said ‘ewww.’ Reagan didn’t notice the feces on the bed and slept a comfortable night. The following day he said ‘what the squishy bed. Best night sleep I’ve ever had. I’ll need to ask the maid how she got the bed to mold to my back.’ Reagan was later told he was sleeping on a piece of shit, a claim he said he didn’t remember.Pranks on incoming presidents and staff is a long tradition, as noted by the TV series The West Wing and confirmed by W. Bush staff member who said, “Oh man, Clinton loved pranks. He glued all the table draws shut. And after we pried them open, we found a very stinking surprise. We were told Clinton had kept his stool samples for months to pull off this prank. It was pretty funny.Obama said, “The night before the Inauguration, I’ll eat a huge BBQ dinner, ribs, greens, beans, the whole works. Then, after I sign over the last Presidential Pardons, I’ll take a little trip back to the bedroom with a magazine and push out a nice surprise for Trump. We have a betting pool on how long it takes for him to notice. My bet is over two hours. Probably won’t pull a Reagan and sleep on it for several days.”Don’t worry Donald, it’s just locker room pranks.








By all historic measures the U.S. economy has probably been in a continuous recession since 2000 following the collapse of the Dot Com bubble, and most definitely with their entry into what became known as The Great Recession following the 2008 financial crisis.  And by historically we are of course referring to data modeling based on 1980 measures rather than on today’s government reporting which has experienced a multitude of model revisions bent on aiding whichever political party was holding the White House.Two days ago on March 15, the Federal Reserve announced a new rate hike which was considered by many analysts to be the worst timing for one in the past 37 years in relation to current GDP growth estimates.  And for those who actually watched Fed Chairman Janet Yellen try to justify the rate hike, all they heard was how strong the economy was in their eyes, and that raising rates would do little to effect the ‘recovery’.Yet just prior to the rate hike announcement the Atlanta Fed reported a revision to their Q1 GDP numbers that brought estimates to below 1%, which when accounting for the real rate of inflation means the economy is well into a recession already.  And now on March 17 another huge indicator was reported on that provides even more evidence that the economy is accelerating downward at a very fast clip.Today we got some more weakness-confirming real-time ‘hard’ data confirming the facts that the US economy is anything but as strong and resilient as Yellen proclaimed it.Industrial Production has never declined on a 24-month basis without the US economy being in recession… – ZerohedgeIn addition to Industrial Production falling off precipitously, this week we also saw reports that consumer retail spending had experienced its own sharp decline, and rising price inflation has put the economy right square in the crosshairs of Stagflation.Despite 10 years of near zero interest rates, and 10’s of trillions of dollars pumped into the banks and markets to keep the afloat, the economy has experienced its worst post-recession recovery in the history of the country, and that was with the manipulated data models which even saw increases of the ‘seasonal adjustments’ under former President Barack Obama.  And sadly the Fed will continue to be on the wrong side of history here in 2017 just as the last Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke refused to accept that the economy was in recession back in 2010 despite it being the worst economic growth since the actual Great Depression.Kenneth Schortgen Jr is a writer for The Daily Economist, Secretsofthefed.com, Roguemoney.net, and Viral Liberty, and hosts the popular youtube podcast on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Ken can also be heard Wednesday afternoons giving an weekly economic report on the Angel Clark radio show.

From ReutersThe Federal Reserve building in Washington September 1, 2015. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueA Republican-controlled committee of lawmakers approved a bill on Tuesday to allow a congressional audit of Federal Reserve monetary policy, a proposal Fed policymakers have opposed and which faces an uncertain path to final approval.Democrats uniformly spoke against the proposal during a meeting of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, suggesting the bill would face stronger resistance than in the past.“We should not in any way hinder their independence,” said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, echoing the sentiment of Fed policymakers who say they could come under political pressure to avoid making unpopular decisions such as raising interest rates to slow growth and control inflation.The next step for the bill would be a floor vote by the entire House, where Republicans hold a solid majority.Republican President Donald Trump expressed support for audits of the U.S. central bank during his election campaign, but it remained unclear whether the White House would back the proposal.Republicans proposed numerous bills during the Obama administration to open the Fed up to deeper scrutiny, arguing the added transparency would ensure the Fed was accountable and free of outside influence.Currently, the Fed publishes detailed audits of its finances but it keeps the inner workings of its monetary policy deliberations secret, publishing transcripts of policy meetings only with a five-year lag.The proposal approved on Tuesday would “put an end to that reign of secrecy,” said Representative Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who submitted the bill.The House has already passed versions of the bill twice, with dozens of Democrats joining nearly unanimous Republican support in 2012 and 2014. Those versions of the legislation died in the Senate.Republicans control both houses of Congress but only have a narrow majority in the Senate.Representative Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts was among Democrats who voted in favor of similar legislation in 2012 and 2014 but came out against the current proposal, saying it could lead to political interference at the Fed.Lynch said he hoped a compromise could be found that increased transparency at the Fed, such as by requiring it to publish transcripts of policy meetings two years after they take place.Categories: Economy, The FedTags: bill, committee, House, scrutiny








It has been a rough few years for the globalists. Growing popular furor at transnational elites for their corruption and mismanagement has led to the UK voting to leave the European Union, Italians shooting down a pro-EU referendum, and the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States.This year’s meeting of globalist elite in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, seemed more like group therapy than policy planning. Political and corporate leaders sadly recognized that populism was on the ascendancy and that increasingly people were rebuking their project.Former Obama economic advisor and hedge fund consultant Larry Summers lamented that middle class Americans had lost faith that elites worked in their interest, saying “There’s obviously elements of the middle class looking up and seeing how well an elite has lived and seeing all the various benefits that have gone to people at the top of the income distribution.”Summers also offered a pretty sharp critique for someone who recently served in government: “I think it’s a mistake not to recognize that the middle class in my country, and I think in others, is also very concerned that people do not feel that the government is fighting for it.”IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde went even further than addressing perceptions. Lagarde conceded that the economic model was failing working people and suggested more wealth redistribution was in order. For the reformed model to work, she said, “it needs to be granular, it needs to be regional, it needs to be focused on what will people get out of it and it probably means more redistribution than we have in place at the moment.”The IMF under Lagarde’s leadership has been slowly moving away from neoliberal orthodoxy. A report last June concluded that neoliberal economic policy, a staple of the IMF for over 20 years, led to slower economic growth and increased income inequality.A study by Oxfam, published in the run up to Davos, certainly drives the inequality point home. According to the study, just eight men own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world.Given such stagnant growth and yawning inequality, it would be more surprising if there wasn’t a populist backlash. How deluded must these elites have been to think that austerity for the poor and bailouts for the rich would never have yielded serious opposition?Regardless of previous bubbles—both economic and political—the political and economic elite have been shocked into reality by recent events. Will they adopt Lagarde’s redistributionist policies, or double-down on technocratic neoliberalism? If they chose the latter, their days at the top may be numbered.








Charles Hugh Smith – As this chart from Google Trends illustrates, interest in the Deep State has increased dramatically in 2017. The term/topic has clearly moved from the specialist realm to the mainstream. I’ve been writing about the Deep State, and specifically, the fractures in the Deep State, for years.In this risible view, there is no Deep State “conspiracy” (the media’s favorite term of dismissal/ridicule), just a bunch of “good German” bureaucrats industriously doing the Empire’s essential work of undermining democracies that happen not to prostrate themselves at the feet of the Empire, murdering various civilians via drone strikes, surveilling the U.S. populace, planting bugs in new iPhones, issuing fake news while denouncing anything that questions the dominant narratives as “fake news,” arranging sweetheart deals with dictators and corporations, and so on.Amusingly, now that “Progressives” have prostituted themselves to the Security Agencies and the Neocons/Neoliberals, they are busy denying the Deep State exists.For example, There is No Deep State (The New Yorker).The New Yorker is right about one thing–the Deep State is not a “conspiracy:” it is a vast machine of control that is largely impervious to the views or demands of elected representatives or the American people. The key to understanding this social-political-economic control is to grasp that control of the narratives, expertise and authority is control of everything. Allow me to illustrate how this works.The typical politician has a busy daily schedule of speaking at the National Motherhood and Apple Pie Day celebration, listening to the “concerns” of important corporate constituents, attending a lunch campaign fundraiser, meeting with lobbyists and party committees, being briefed by senior staff, and so on.Senior administrators share similarly crowded schedules, minus the fundraising but adding budget meetings, reviewing employee complaints and multiple meetings with senior managers and working groups.Both senior elected officials and senior state administrators must rely on narratives, expertise and authority because they have insufficient time and experience to do original research and assessment.Narratives create an instant context that “makes sense” of various data points and events. Narratives distill causal factors into an explanatory story with an implicit teleology–because of this and that, the future will be thus and so.For example: because Iraq has weapons of mass destruction (WMD), the future promises the terrible likelihood (more than a possibility, given Iraqi deployment of poison gas in the Iraq-Iran War) that America or its allies will be devastated by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. This teleology leads to the inescapable need to eliminate Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction by any means necessary, and remove the political will to use them by removing Iraq’s leader from power.Politicos and senior administrators rely on expertise and authority as the basis of deciding whether something is accurate and actionable. Professional specialists are assumed to have the highest available levels of expertise, and their position in institutions that embody the highest authority give their conclusions the additional weight of being authoritative. The experts’ conclusion doesn’t just carry the weight of expertise, it has been reviewed by senior officials of the institution, and so it also carries the weight of institutional authority.So when the C.I.A. briefing by its experts claims Iraq has WMD, and the briefing includes various threads of evidence that the institution declares definitive, who is a non-expert to challenge this conclusion and teleology? On what technical basis does the skeptic reject the expertise and authority of the institution?We can now define the Deep State with some precision. The Deep State is fundamentally the public-private centralized nodes that collect, archive and curate dominant narratives and their supporting evidence, and disseminate these narratives (and their implicit teleologies) to the public via the media and to the state agencies via formal and informal inter-departmental communication channels.By gaining control of the narratives, evidence, curation and teleology, each node concentrates power. the power to edit out whatever bits contradict the dominant narrative is the source of power, for once the contradictory evidence is buried or expunged, it ceases to exist.For example, the contradictory evidence in the Pentagon Papers was buried by being declared Top Secret. The bureaucratic means to bury skeptical (i.e. heretical) views or evidence are many. Sending the authors to figurative Siberia is remarkably effective, as is burying the heretical claims in a veritable mountain of data that few if any will ever survey.Curation is a critical factor in maintaining control of the narrative and thus of control; the evidence is constantly curated to best support the chosen narrative which in turn supports the desired teleology, which then sets the agenda and the end-game.The senior apparatchiks of the old Soviet Union were masters of curation; when a Soviet leader fell from favor, he was literally excised from the picture–his image was erased from photos.This is how narratives are adjusted to better fit the evidence. Thus the accusation that “the Russians hacked our election” has been tabled because it simply doesn’t align with any plausible evidence. That narrative has been replaced with variants, such as “the Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee.” Now that this claim has also been shown to be false, new variants are popping up weekly, with equally poor alignment with evidence.The primary claim of each Deep State node is that its expertise and authority cannot be questioned. In other words, while the dominant narrative can be questioned (but only cursorily, of course), the expertise and authority of the institutional node cannot be questioned.This is why the Deep State is fracturing: the expertise and authority of its nodes are delaminating because its narratives no longer align with the evidence. If various Security Agencies sign off on the narrative that “Russia hacked our election” (a nonsense claim from the start, given the absurd imprecision of the “hacking”–hacking into what? Voting machines? Electoral tallies?), and that narrative is evidence-free and fact-free, i.e. false, then the expertise and authority of those agencies comes into legitimate question.Once the legitimacy of the expertise and authority is questioned, control of the narrative is imperiled. The control of the narrative is control of the teleology, the agenda and the end-game–in other words, everything. If the institution loses control of the dominant narrative, it loses its hold on power.This is why the Deep State is in turmoil–its narratives no longer make sense, or are in direct conflict with other nodes’ narratives or have been delegitimized by widening gaps between “definitive” claims and actual evidence.There is indeed a Deep State, but its control of dominant narratives, and thus its source of control and power, is crumbling. The gap between the narratives and the evidence that supports them has widened to the point of collapse.SF Source Of Two Minds March 2017

Mexico’s state oil company, Pemex, is a perfect example of the ongoing collapse in the global oil industry.
We are in serious trouble, and it is mostly due to oil:
From SRSRocco:Falling oil prices and declining production are putting severe pressure on the company’s financial balance sheet.  It has been four long years since Pemex posted a small profit.  However, since 2012, Pemex has suffered huge annual losses while its long term debt has exploded.The result is… Pemex is technically bankrupt.  Now, I am not the only one saying this.  There have been several articles written about horrible financial situation at Pemex.  According to the following article, Mexico’s Largest Company Is Broke:March 3, 2016:Mexico’s largest company is broke. The country’s state oil company, Pemex, which is one of the federal government’s main sources of revenue, is losing money and is one of the world’s most indebted oil firms.The company’s production has dropped for 11 straight years now, while gross income plummeted more than 80 percent last year.One of the biggest causes of the financial problems at Pemex is due to its falling oil production.  Crude oil production at Pemex has fallen 35% since 2005, from 3.3 million barrels per day (mbd) to 2.1 mbd in 2016:As oil prices and production declined, Pemex lost $30.3 billion in 2015 and $14.3 billion in 2016.  The reason Pemex cut its losses in 2016, even as oil prices fell lower, was due to hefty budget cuts and the layoff of thousands of workers.  According to the article, Pemex Will Layoff 50,000 Employees:April 15, 2016:Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) will cut up to 50 thousand workers gradually, according to Alexis Milo, chief economist at Deutsche Bank.  “Pemex has approximately three times the number of employees should.  Therefore, we anticipate that it will unveil a program of mass layoffs, but gradual, approximately 50 thousand workers, “explained the expert analysis.Even with budget cuts and worker layoffs, the financial situation as Pemex continues to disintegrate.  Pemex’s long term debt jumped nearly $12 billion last year to $87.4 billion.  Since 2005, Pemex’s long term debt has more than doubled from $36.6 billion to the $87.4 billion at the end of 2016:Energy analysts have stated that many of Pemex’s financial problems also stem from mismanagement and possible corruption issues.  While this may be true, the world’s top public oil companies have also seen their long term debt skyrocket over the past several years.  For example, Royal Dutch Shell’s long term debt has ballooned from $38 billion in 2014 to $83 billion in 2016.Another interesting negative side effect of lower oil prices on Mexico’s economy, is the falling value of its currency, the Peso.  This chart shows value of the Mexican Peso to the U.S. Dollar over the past 20 years:The Mexican Peso-U.S. Dollar is shown in orange, while the Brent Crude oil price is in black.  As we can see the largest drop in the Mexican Peso’s value took place when the Brent Crude oil price declined significantly.  Since the Brent Crude price fell below $100 in August 2014, the value of the Mexican Peso’s has fallen 32% versus the U.S. Dollar.A falling value of the Mexican Peso means that its outstanding debts based in U.S. Dollars increases.  This can be plainly seen by the huge rise of Mexico’s net public external debt.  Again, since the price of Brent Crude fell below $100 in August 2014, Mexico’s net public external debt has nearly doubled:Mexico’s net external public debt increased from approximately $1.8 trillion Pesos in mid 2014 to 3.5 trillion Pesos currently ($184 billion in U.S. Dollars).  With falling oil revenues on top of rapidly increasing debt at Pemex, the company is finding it extremely difficult to finance or rollover its debt.  That being said, For Mexico’s Troubled Pemex, Deeper Debt Seems The Only Option:July 18, 2016:Unable to generate revenue, Pemex has decided to deepen its debt, a decision that has troubled the international markets and rating agencies. Borrowing provides short-term relief, they warn, but it also increases fiscal pressure. Falling output and lower oil prices reduce expectations of generating cash, which in turn reduces the company’s ability to invest in exploration and production: a vicious circle that is hard to break.Pemex has few options. It is fast running out of places to borrow money, while reducing its outgoings through mass redundancies would be political suicide for the government: the company employs some 150,000 people, with a further 100,000 former employees on its payroll.Pemex faces one of the most difficult situations in its history, but there is no question of it being allowed to go bankrupt, despite the increasing burden it represents to the state. That said, if the government cannot turn its fortunes round, Pemex could end up dragging the Mexican economy down with it.The last sentence in the quote above is the likely outcome for Mexico’s state run oil company.  That is, Pemex will likely drag the Mexican economy down with it.  I believe it’s just a matter of time.Now, I am not singling out Pemex as what is wrong with the global oil industry,  Even though Pemex may have been guilty of employing more workers than it needed, I am happy to see some of its profits going to its workers or the Mexican economy rather than to a multi-national corporate conglomerate that enriches a few at the top.Another negative factor facing Pemex’s future is its falling oil reserves.  Pemex’s proven hydrocarbon reserves have fallen from 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2003 to 13 billion boe in 2015:While oil companies list their oil and gas reserves as “proved, probable and possible categories”, as the oil price continues to decline, it will most likely be the proven reserves that will remain commercially viable.  And even some of the so-called “Proven” reserves may not be profitable to extract if oil prices fall back to $30 or even lower.If you have been reading my articles on the Thermodynamic oil decline, the model suggests that the global oil price will continue to decline because the rapidly falling net energy won’t be worth that much to the world economy.  This has to be one of the most misunderstood factors by my readers and the public.For some strange reason, people just can’t get the head around a continued falling price of oil.  They still cling to the economic principle of “Supply & Demand.”  I used to believe market prices were based on supply and demand forces, but now I realize it has always been the principle of thermodynamics that is the leading factor.  While supply and demand forces add volatility to the market price of a commodity, metal, energy or a good, the cost of production has always been the overriding factor in determining price.As the global oil industry and its massive support system continues to devour more and more energy each year to supply oil to the market, the value of the oil supplied to the market will also decline.  Again, you have to think about a barrel of oil like the value of a brand new car versus one that is 15 years old.  A brand new car is worth say, $25,000 versus a 15 year old car valued at $5-$6,000.  The reason is the embedded energy in all the parts have been worn out and are now depreciated.  Thus, in even more time, the value of the car will be based on its scrap value.For example, the paper titled, EROI of different fuels and the implications for society provided the following figures for U.S. and global oil and gas EROI’s:The EROI for the production of oil and gas globally by publicly traded companies has declined from 30:1 in 1995 to about 18:1 in 2006 (Gagnon et al., 2009). The EROI for discovering oil and gas in the US has decreased from more than 1000:1 in 1919 to 5:1 in the 2010s, and for production from about 25:1 in the 1970s to approximately 10:1 in 2007 (Guilford et al., 2011). Alternatives to traditional fossil fuels such as tar sands and oil shale (Lambert et al., 2012) deliver a lower EROI, having a mean EROI of 4:1.Not only has the EROI for the production of oil and gas by the globally traded companies fallen from 30:1 in 1995 to 18:1 in 2006, the EROI of U.S. oil discoveries fell from a staggering 1000:1 in 1919 to 5:1 in the 2010’s.  I have not seen current EROI oil and gas production data for the United States or global oil industry, but I can assure you they have continued to decline considerably since the last data reported in 2006.The falling EROI is gutting the entire global oil industry.  While some state run or publicly traded oil companies may be performing better than others, or enjoy a higher EROI, they will all continue to head lower over the following years.As I mentioned in the beginning of the article, Mexico’s Pemex state oil company is technically bankrupt.  Their total liabilities are greater than their total assets:Pemex’s total assets are valued at 2.2 trillion Mexican Pesos versus 3.5 trillion in total liabilities.  Converting this to U.S. Dollars (shown on the right hand side of the table), Pemex’s total assets are $107.4 billion compared to $171.9 billion in total liabilities.You will notice a large portion of Pemex’s total liabilities are due to obligations for its “Reserve for employee benefits” of $59 billion.  Even if Pemex decided to discontinue paying all its employee benefits, it would still have total liabilities of $113 billion, higher than its current assets of $107 billion.The Mexican government will do all in its power to keep Pemex from going bankrupt.  However, propping up a company that will continue to lose money is not sustainable for long.  Furthermore, Pemex is finding it increasing difficult to finance his mounting long term debt which surpassed $87 billion in 2016.The global oil industry is in serious trouble.  Surging debt levels while profits turn into losses will only make a bad situation worse in the future.  While many energy analysts are pointing to the recent increase in U.S. oil production as positive sign for energy independence in the next few years, I see it much differently.The majority of the increase in U.S. oil production since the lows last year has come from one field… the Permian.  According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency Drilling Productivity Reports, combined production from Bakken and Eagle Ford has only increased 40,000 barrels per day since they bottomed several months ago.  However, nearly half of the increase in total U.S. oil production came from the Permian Field.As the U.S. and global economies continue to weaken this year, demand for oil will decline.  This will put more pressure on the short-term oil price by pushing it lower, thus negatively impacting the global oil industry even more.  At some point, the U.S. and global oil industry will likely suffer a heart-attack.Lastly, I would like to remind everyone that oil is the lifeblood of our advanced economies.  Without oil, the production and transportation of other energy sources such as coal, natural gas and bio-fuels would be seriously hampered.  Where I live, there is a constant movement of coal trucks up and down the interstate transporting coal to electric generation plants or to railroad coal terminals.With the advent of modern truck transportation, a lot of the nations railroad lines were removed or neglected.  We are in serious trouble, and it is mostly due to oil… not fiat money or politics.Idiots. We’re the crazy ones living within our means though. The landlord gave a reprieve from the stress he has been supplying for a few months.   Maybe that’s how my shingles got triggered in January and February.  Not to be outdone or forgotten the boss took up the slack and dropped a stress bomb first thing when I showed up for work this morning.  Damn everything.Hang in there Andrew James! Sorry for your situation.  It WILL improve..















DonateA mass grave with bodies of 50 civilians, killed in airstrikes of the US-led coalition on residential areas of Mosul, has been discovered in the southwestern part of the city.Photo: SIPA / AP / Christian StephenA mass burial of civilians has been discovered in the Iraqi city of Mosul, the Shafaq News information portal reported, citing a representative of the administration of Nineveh province. According to the website, all these people were killed in airstrikes, carried out by the US-led coalition on residential areas of the city.“A mass grave with bodies of 50 people, including women and children, was found in the area of New Mosul in the southwestern part of the city on the right bank of the Tiger,” the official said.The UN expressed concern over the large number of casualties among civilian population of the Iraqi city of Mosul, who lost their lives in airstrikes on residential areas of the city.Earlier, Deputy Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, Farhan Khak, said that the UN is concerned about reports of a large number of casualties among civilians in Mosul, who died as the result of coalition’s airstrikes.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid bin Ra’ad Zeid al-Hussein, also noted large number of civilian casualties in the city and stressed that the responsibility for these losses entirely lies with the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group and the international coalition, led by the US. He called on the Iraqi Army and the US-led coalition‘s forces to urgently review their tactics of the fighting in order to avoid further civilian casualties.

        'Afvallen is echt niet zo moeilijk'      
         29 maart 2017 door Jop Eikelboom en Laura van Gelder      Het zal je niet zijn ontgaan: Linda de Mol is op dieet. Maar hoe doet ze dat precies? Volgens Linda is afvallen echt niet zo moeilijk. Met deze tips lukt het jou ook!Neem thuis eens de trap naar boven in plaats van de lift
Als je thuiskomt na een lange dag, is het erg verleidelijk om even de lift naar boven te pakken. Niet doen! Wie de lift neemt, verbrandt geen calorieën. Hetzelfde geldt overigens voor de roltrap naar de zolder.Vraag je chef om vijf gangen te maken in plaats van zes
Als je elke dag een paar amuses overslaat, boek je snel resultaat. Vraag je chef daarom om het bij vijf gangen te houden. Lekker én gezond. Als mijn sterrenkok het kan, kan de jouwe het ook!Spring ’s ochtends meteen even in het zwembad
Als je toch op weg bent naar de badkamer, kun je net zo goed even een lekkere duik in het zwembad nemen. Trek elke ochtend een paar baantjes voordat je personal assistant aan je dag begint. Kleine moeite en lekker verfrissend!Vraag aan de tuinman of hij ook mee wil lijnen
Samen diëten is gezelliger dan alleen. Vraag daarom of je tuinman met je meedoet! Als je er even doorheen zit, kan hij je motiveren door je te vertellen dat hij het allemaal nog veel slechter trekt.Wat een loser wijf. weer in het nieuwsLosser wijf?
Heh?Bij zomergasten was ze ook zo lekker losjes.Een vaste kok als pik genaamd Diedrik geeft kopstootjes aan analisten zonder schuldgevoel te leiden in kanalen.Gewoon leegzuigen.Wordt vrijwilliger bij de Voedselbank, en geestelijk vliegen de kilo’s er binnen een dag vanaf.Te denken valt. Te tanken staat.Dat is de kracht van Linda: ze is zo gewoon gebleven!Praktisch haar en toch tevreden!Ze moet gewoon haar grenzen wat verleggen. Als je het streefgewicht naar boven bijstelt, zeg 100 kg, dan kun je er weer even tegen aan en kun je het diner tijdelijk afronden met twee toetjes.Dat doet Corrie ook alweer een paar jaar.wie is dit? Is dit weer zo’n BN’er die bekend geworden is door deelname aan ‘Wie is de mol?’?Quote van linda:“‘Vraag je kok om een gang minder te bereiden”
               ***********************************
Het lijkt me beter indien Linda Mollig gewoon op de gang blijft, als de rest aan de gang gaat met de gangen.
😉ik zal ook eens aan mijn kok vragen voor een gang minder. En die lekkere tuinvrouw kan wel met me meeeten.  het zou haar goed doen als zij haar kok voor de voedselbank liet kokenIk had altijd graag een handtekening gehad van haar.Ze vergeet de belangrijkste tip:
’s Ochtends zelf de krant uit de brievenbus halen.
Is toch snel 2 kilometer wandelen, langs de oprit.Ik ben ooit aan haar verschenen toen ze nog helemaal onbekend was. Sindsdien ben ik altijd een fan geweest van haar warmhartige en persoonlijke benadering. Ze is een grote ziel die heeft ingezien dat ieder mens goed moet eten en die zelf het goede voorbeeld geeft.Aan haar verschenen?   Was u een aartsengel in een vorig leven?Mieke, als de buitengewoon vrome vrouw, actief lid van de kerkgemeente, en een van de uitverkorenen van de Heer die u was heb ik het daar uitgebreid over gehad toen u uw man gedropt had. Maar aartsengelen?Ik heb mijn man ook gedropt.  Maar daar hoorde ik u niet over.‘Duhuh!” zegt ze op de foto.Nee, zo’n mondje krijg je als je (te?) veel pijpt. en als ze nou stopt met pijpen en weer gewoon gaat neuqen valt ze meer af, want fappen verbrandt meer kaloriën. Makkelijk zat, maar wie wil er nou zijn leuter vies maken aan zo’n afgelikte boterham. Dát is haar probleemMijn paard staat in de gang. Wat nu ?Aha!!
Ik was hem al kwijt.Andréom hem weg te halen: Ik heb hele grote bloemkolen! Daarmee kan je hem wel weglokkenJa ze is zo gewoon gebleven,sterrenkok, tuinman, personal trainer,neemt nu geen 6 gangen maar 5. Zo gewoon!!!Tip van Corrie.Maak regelmatig een wandeling met benefits in de duinen in Scheveningen
Open een account op Second Love. Van goede zwetende sex val je veel af. Corrie.Zweefse seks in de duinen is als schuren bouwen met de gedachte zonder zand weg te komen.Kundige Corrie!!Waarom is dat afvallen dan niet aan u te zien. Jongens, jongens, wat een gewicht zeg, niet normaal!Mijn strategie is altijd tussen de dikke mensen gaan zitten, dat helpt me altijd om me te distantiëren van die paupers. Zeker tijdens het eten is dat goed, niks is zo goor als dikke mensen vette troep naar binnen te zien werken, dus de eetlust vergaat je meteen.Ik had laatst een Chinees meisje tegenover me in de trein dat besloot om  een bak pistache-nootjes één voor één krakend te gaan zitten wegwerken.na de halve bak heb ik haar aan aan haar haren door het gangpad gesleept en elders in het bagagerek gegooid. Zó!Toch weer een paar kilocalorieën weggewerkt.
Kwestie van samenwerking.Geld speelt geen Rolex.Ze moet wat vaker in de spiegel kijken. Dan rent ze gillend weg en vergaat haar de eetlust ook wel.1) Vraag je personal trainer om stiekem wat langer door te gaan
2) Vraag je bevriende cosmetisch arts liposuctie te doen als je voor een borstvergroting komt
3) Vraag aan je chauffeur de champagne in de koelkast van de Rolls te vervangen door Spa rood
4) Laat het vliegtuig eens wat vaker staan en neem de fiets
5) Vraag aan je broer of hij een tv-programma kan bedenken zodat het Hart van Nederland als stimulans kan dienen
                                Het Oekraïne-Ruslandjaar, de viering van een eeuwenoude vriendschapsband tussen de landen, kent vooralsnog een stroeve start. Verschillende incidenten […]

Donald Trump has already cause more controversy than pretty much any President ever. He’s caused even a bigger stir over his interactions with high profile evangelical preachers. But we found something from 2007 that’ll cast everything in a new light.Kim Clement was a well known and respected prophet. Back in 2007 he gave at the time a very unusual prophecy in that he said Trump would become God’s Trumpet, and would be placed in the highest office in the land.Points were given that even though he has “hot blood,” he would be used to protect our country’s borders, and would be used of God to fool the world.The full prophecy is as follows. Keep in mind this was given in 2007, before Obama’s second term began! Who was thinking about Donald Trump being President back then? No one, except the Lord.“This that shall take place shall be the most unusual thing, a transfiguration, a going into the marketplace, if you wish into the news media…”“Where Time magazine will have no choice but to say what I want them to say, Newsweek, what I want them to say, The View, what I want them to say,”“Trump shall become a trumpet, says the Lord. Trump shall become a trumpet. I will raise up the Trump to become a trumpet and Bill Gates to open up the gate of a financial realm for the Church, says the Lord.”“For God said, ‘I will not forget 9/11. I will not forget what took place that day, and I will not forget the gatekeeper that watched over New York, who will once again stand and watch over this nation, says the Spirit of God.”“It shall come to pass that the man that I place in the highest office shall go in whispering my Name. But God said, when he enters into the office, he will be shouting out by the power of the Spirit,”“There will be a praying President, not a religious one. For I will fool the people, says the Lord. I will fool the people, yes I will. God says, the one that is chosen shall go in and they shall says, ‘He has hot blood.’”“For the Spirit of God says, Yes, he may have hot blood, but he will bring the walls of protection on this country in a greater way and the economy of this country shall change rapidly, says the Lord of Hosts.”“Listen to the Word of the Lord. God says, ‘I will put at your helm for two terms a President that will pray, but he not be a praying President when he starts.’”“’I will put him in office and then I will baptize him with the Holy Spirit and my power, says the Lord of Hosts.’”It’s amazing that these prophecies were given many years ago, and the accuracy they hold within them.There will still be plenty that find ways to dismiss what was being prophesied here and look for ways to be critical of Trump’s Presidency, but what would be easier? Cut down Trump every chance you have? Or pray for and bless President Trump as the man that God has chosen to lead this country to a place its never been before?H/T








(SP) – In the wake of the news that the Oakland Raiders are officially moving to Las Vegas as early as the 2018 season, the California Parole Board quickly acted to make it clear that Raiders fans will not be allowed to travel to Nevada in order to attend games there.“Before any Raiders fans get any ideas about crossing state lines to root on their team and conduct all sorts of crimes, we decided to come out today and nip that in the bud,” parole board spokesman Gerald Patino said. “Raiders fans have one more season of weekend release and then it’s back to prison to stay.”The news that the Raiders are leaving town was met with disappointment by the current fans in Oakland, all of whom are convicted felons.“I haven’t been this upset until I was first given 10 to 15 years for armed robbery,” said Robert Faulk. “Then, after the news broke, I briefly thought I might be able to escape to Nevada and maybe knock off a casino, but the parole board obviously isn’t going to cooperate on that. This really sucks.”Oakland Police were notified by team officials this afternoon before the move was announced so they could prepare for the angry fan reaction.“You don’t want 60,000 pissed off violent felons rampaging through the streets without giving the police a heads up,” said team owner Mark Davis. “No offense, of course. We’ve appreciated the support we’ve gotten all these years from the local crime community.”But Oakland Police chief Randall Stern said there were no serious incidents.“Most of them are currently incarcerated because their parole period were over or they’ve been picked up on new charges,” he said. “The offseason is pretty calm around here.”  SportsPickle is the premier site on the Internet for sports news and takes.this article explicitly states that ALL RAIDERS FANS ARE CONVICTED FELONS. they are not. even if they were, the parole board’s authority only covers those on parole.Opinion

	On March 23rd, Gallup headlined “South Sudan, Haiti and Ukraine Lead World in Suffering”, and the Ukrainian part of that can unquestionably be laid at the feet of U.S. President Barack Obama, who in February 2014 imposed upon Ukraine a very bloody coup (see it here), which he and his press misrepresented (and still misrepresent) as being (and still represent as having been) a ‘democratic revolution’, but was nothing of the sort, and actually was instead the start of the Ukrainian dictatorship and the hell that has since destroyed that country, and brought the people there into such misery, it’s now by far the worst in Europe, and nearly tied with the worst in the entire world.
	America’s criminal ‘news’ media never even reported the coup, nor that in 2011 the Obama regime began planning for a coup in Ukraine, and that by 1 March 2013 they started organizing it inside the U.S. Embassy there, and that they hired members of Ukraine’s two racist-fascist, or nazi, political parties, Right Sector and Svoboda (which latter had been called the Social Nationalist Party of Ukraine until the CIA advised them to change it to Freedom Party, or “Svoboda” instead), and that in February 2014 they did it (and here’s the 4 February 2014 phone call instructing the U.S. Ambassador whom to place in charge of the new regime when the coup will be completed), under the cover of authentic anti-corruption demonstrations that the Embassy organized on the Maidan Square in Kiev, demonstrations that the criminal U.S. ‘news’ media misrepresented as ‘democracy demonstrations,’ though Ukraine already had democracy (but still lots of corruption, even more than today’s U.S. does, and the pontificating Obama said he was trying to end Ukraine’s corruption — which instead actually soared after his coup there). The head of the ‘private CIA’ firm Stratfor said it was “the most blatant coup in history” but he couldn’t say that to Americans, because he knows that our press is just a mouthpiece for the regime (just like it was during the lead-up to George W. Bush’s equally unprovoked invasion of Iraq — for which America’s ‘news’ media suffered likewise no penalties). When subsequently accused by neocons for his having said this, his response was “I told the business journal Kommersant that if the US were behind a coup in Kiev, it would have been the most blatant coup in history,” but he was lying to say this, because, as I pointed out when writing about that rejoinder of his, he had, in fact, made quite clear in his Kommersant interview, that it was, in his view “the most blatant coup in history,” no conditionals on that. 
	Everybody knows what Obama, and Clinton, and Sarkozy, did to Libya — in their zeal to eliminate yet another nation’s leader who was friendly toward Russia (Muammar Gaddafi), they turned one of the highest-living-standard nations in Africa into a failed state and huge source of refugees (as well as of weapons that the Clinton State Department transferred to the jihadists in Syria to bring down Bashar al-Assad, another ally of Russia) — but the ‘news’ media have continued to hide what Obama (assisted by America’s European allies, especially Poland and Netherlands, and also by America’s apartheid Middle Eastern ally, Israel) did to Ukraine.
	I voted for Obama, partly because the insane McCain (“bomb, bomb, bomb Iran”) and the creepy Romney (“Russia, this is, without question, our number one geopolitical foe”) were denounced by the (duplicitous) Obama for saying such evil things, their aggressive international positions, which continued old Cold-War-era hostilities into the present, even after the Cold War had ended long ago (in 1991) (but only on the Russian side). I since have learned that in today’s American political system, the same aristocracy controls both of our rotten political Parties, and American democracy no longer exists. (And the only scientific study of whether America between the years 1981 and 2002 was democratic found that it was not, and it already confirmed what Jimmy Carter later said on 28 July 2015: “Now it’s just an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or being elected president. And the same thing applies to governors, and U.S. Senators and congress members.” But yet our Presidents continue the line, now demonstrably become a myth, of ‘American democracy’, and use it as a sledgehammer against other governments, to ‘justify’ invading (or, in Ukraine’s case, overthrowing via a ‘democratic revolution’) their lands (allies of Russia) such as in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and maybe even soon, Iran.
	Here are some of the events and important historical details along the way to Ukraine’s plunge into a worse condition than most African nations:
	“Yanukovych’s Removal Was Unconstitutional”
	“Obama Definitely Caused The Malaysian Airliner To Be Downed”
	“War on Donbass was planned to ignite a major war in Europe.”
	“Our ‘Enemies’ In Ukraine Speak”
	“Meet Ukraine’s Master Mass-Murderer: Dmitriy Yarosh”
	“Ukrainian Soldier Explains Why He Enjoys Killing Russians”
	“Russia’s Leader Putin Rejects Ukrainian Separatists’ Aim To Become Part Of Russia”
	“Gallup: Ukrainians Loathe the Kiev Government Imposed by Obama”
	Please send this article to every friend who is part of the majority that, as a Quinnipiac University poll published on March 22nd reported, “A total of 51 percent of voters say they can trust U.S. intelligence agencies to do what is right ‘almost all of the time’ or ‘most of the time’” (and that level of trust was far higher than for the rotten press and for the rotten politicians), even after the CIA’s rubber-stamping Bush’s lies to invade Iraq, and after the FBI’s shameless performance on Hillary Clinton’s privatized State Department emails even after her smashing their cell-phones with hammers, etc., and all the other official cover-ups, with no American officials even so much as being charged for their rampant crimes against the American public. Besides: ever since the CIA’s founding, it has had an “Operation Gladio” that specializes in organizing terrorist acts so as for them to be blamed on, first, communist countries when they existed; and, then, after the end of communism, on allies of Russia. Did the American dictatorship begin right after FDR died in 1945? How much longer will these lies succeed?
	For the people of Iraq, and of Syria, and of Ukraine, and many such countries, this dictatorship has destroyed their lives. Trusting the ‘intelligence’ services of a dictatorship doesn’t make any sense at all. They’re all working for the aristocracy, the billionaires — not for any public, anywhere; not here, not there, just nowhere. Should the cattle trust the feedlot-operator? Only ignorance can produce trust, under the conditions that actually exist.
	So, unless the idea is that ignorance is bliss, pass along the truth, when you find it, because it is very rare — and the system operates to keep it that way.

On the first day of entry into force of visa-free regime with the EU from the European countries have left about 800 people. Among them in the forefront, members of the government of Georgia headed by Prime Minister George Kvirikashvili. This is understandable: a visa-free regime is an important achievement of the ruling team.				
 photo: pixabay.com March 28 residents of Georgia without visas can visit Schengen countries with short-term visits. It is important to note that the right to work in the EU, they do not get the machine to work in Europe, visa is still required. That will bring “bezviz” Europe and Georgia? This browser “MK” talked with the author of the book “Why Georgia has not happened,” the head of the Eurasian analytical club, a political scientist Nikita Mendkovich.– What will change in the life of the Georgians after the entry into force of visa-free regime with Europe? Many of you will immediately want to travel outside of the country?– A surge in exit activity is inevitable after the appearance of such possibilities. Initially, travel will be mainly for tourism, but in the future it will lead to appearance of additional channels for unskilled illegal labor migration – as was the case with the Baltic States after their accession to the EU. They become donors of the labour force for the EU. Because their own economy was in depression, a significant number of people began to emigrate to the West to work. Given that labour migration is characteristic of modern Georgia, in all probability, it will increase, and will be directed primarily to Greece.– However, the current “bezviz” does not entitle you to work…– Of course. But when it interfered with illegal migrants? It is necessary to remind that illegal labour migration entry as tourists, with a further earnings without registration of labour contracts. With such status, many Georgian citizens are now working abroad. In Russia, too, there is the problem of illegal labor migration from some former Soviet countries, including Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.Georgian illegal immigrants in Russia too much.– Of course. The only difference is that the Georgian migration over time, and many have already legalized here, getting citizenship. Nevertheless, the problems with the Georgian illegal labour migration exist.– In Georgia very bad economic situation, high unemployment. Can it happen that all Georgians will go to Europe in search of a better life?To be honest: there is a chance that after some time, migration may become a mass. There was a whole culture of separated families when one family member is working abroad, and others live at the expense of his translations.– There is great likelihood that the citizens of the Russian Federation or other former Soviet States will take Georgian citizenship in order to travel without visas to Europe?I’m not sure. First, there is the common practice of producing long-term multiple-entry Schengen visas to Russian citizens. That is, those who have the funds for regular visits, and who is not in the sanctions list, has enough free regime of entry in the EU. Secondly, given the specific reputation of Georgia after Saakashvili’s regime, “bezviz” does not make the Georgian citizenship attractive to wealthy individuals from other countries.– It is known that for Georgia there is an acute problem of terrorism. Many Georgian citizens, natives of Pankisi gorge are fighting in Syria on the side of the Islamists. Through Georgia passes one of the illegal supply channels of militants in the same Syria, Iraq… is There a danger for the EU the infiltration of terrorists through Georgia to Europe?– Now there is an illegal flow of migrants to Europe directly from Turkey. I don’t think that the status of Georgia something significant to add to this. Although we can not exclude the situation that in such a situation, the terrorists, taking advantage of the confusion, the instability, would be more willing to use their conspiratorial network in Georgia, in the Pankisi gorge. source

As a leading Conservative Blonde Lady Pundit in this divided political climate, I get a lot of flack from commie haters and sensitive social justice warriors. And I’ve got a message for them: You think you’re so special and unique just because you aren’t one of a legion of identical clones engineered in a lab. Well, I’m not buying it.While all you precious little lefties were getting pats on the head from mommy and daddy, I was being assembled from recombinant DNA in a secret incubator under a mountain. And if I did something wrong, like letting a news anchor finish a question in the simulator, or even just shrieking nonstop when exposed to ultraviolet light, I didn’t get a participation award. I got incinerated and reconfigured, and after a lengthy process of trial and error, I turned out JUST FINE.See, you whiners and protestors might now know this but here in the real world, we have these things called “jobs.” My job, according to my handlers and one military guy whose face I never see, is to put a palatable face on inhumane political positions, publish hastily-written and edited books, and make memes of myself looking pretty next to quotes about how refugees are cowards.And I do that job and then sleep like a baby, in a kind of tanning bed full of screens that yells “TRUMP WON GET OVER IT” at me for 17 hours in a row. Can you say the same? Didn’t think so.I don’t need to go to my safe space (a tube of goo) every time somebody states an opinion I don’t agree with. I ONLY need to go there when my gene deterioration gets above 15%, or when I’m hungry for ammonia!These leftards want you to think your rights end where their feelings begin. That society, media and government all have to bend to protect their delicate little fee-fees. It’s not that I don’t have feelings, I do. I even loved once. His name was Red-faced Tough Guy Pundit 88M and his goo-tube was across from mine. He got so mad during a twitter fight that his gene deterioration hit 40% and he exploded. I cried for 20 minutes, was incinerated and reconfigured, and I MOVED ON. Learn from me, crybabies!So sure, when you come after me or one of my kind – the Conways, the Coulters, the Lahrens – it hurts me. Because when something happens to one of us we all telepathically get hurt at the same time. But to all you snowflakes trying to bring me down, try harder. Because until the new Tier 7’s are ready to be deployed, and they’ve resolved the biting issue, I’m not going anywhere.And buddy, they’re biting EVERYTHING.








Three teenagers who were dressed in black and wore masks and gloves broke into a home in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, in broad daylight.All three were shot dead by the homeowner’s son.Investigators haven’t released the names of anyone involved, but say the deceased suspects are between 16 and 18 years old. One of the suspects had a knife and another had brass knuckles.Deputy Nick Mahoney told Fox25 that the preliminary investigation shows that the three suspects went to the residence with the intent to burglarize the home.“They were dressed in black, all had masks on, and all had gloves on,” said Mahoney.Mahoney says the suspects broke in through a glass door in the back of the house. After entering the residence, the suspects encountered the homeowner’s 23-year-old son, who also lives there. The resident was carrying an AR-15.“There was a short exchange of words and then gunfire happened,” he said.More, from Tulsa World:The son, who lives at the residence, told deputies he was sleeping when he was awakened by “loud bangs” coming from the back door. He armed himself with the rifle and opened fire when the intruders came inside and he encountered them in the hallway, he told the deputies. Two of the intruders died in the kitchen, while the third made his way outside and succumbed to his injuries in the driveway.So far, it appears the shootings were self-defense, but the investigation is in the early stages. Prosecutors could consider the shootings as legitimate under Oklahoma’s “Make My Day” law, which says a resident has the right to use deadly force if an intruder has entered or is in the process of entering the resident’s home, reports Tulsa World.Deputies say they arrested a fourth person, a 21-year-old Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, who turned herself in after hearing media reports about the incident.She reportedly told police that she had driven the three burglars to the house and was supposed to have picked them up after the burglary.Rodriguez was booked into the Wagoner County Jail on three complaints each of first-degree murder and first-degree burglary. A person who is committing a felony when a death occurs can be charged with felony murder.Delivered by The Daily SheepleWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos (Click for details).

While the rest of the world has more important things to do, a failed British politician and self-confessed former drug addict called Louise Mensch has been doing the rounds in the US spouting Russophobic conspiracy theories that would even make the folks at CNN and Washington Post, cringe with embarrassment.I think only former fascist Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk can match her when it comes to patent historical lies, patent lies in the present and odd, twists of illogical contradictions that would make Bill Clinton appear as honest as Abe Lincoln.Last year the permanently unhinged conspiracy theorist spouted racist remarks about Russia having no culture.Now she is claiming that the phrase America First was a Nazi slogan invented by Russia. First of all, the slogan is American and drives from the ‘America First Committee’ formed in 1940.The AFC was a bi-partisan group of American citizens which opposed FDR’s increased involvement in the Second World War, prior to the US formally entering the war in late 1941 after the Pear Harbor Attack.So nothing to do with Russia or Nazis. The mere fact that she associated Nazism with the country which gave nearly 30 million people to defeat Nazism is not only an insult but a mind boggling lie.What beggars belief is how anyone, anywhere could take her seriously. I could understand if her insane statements came out of the Rada (Parliament) in Kiev, but even by the standards of American or British Russophobia, her entire raison d’être seems absurd.Either she is the biggest publicity whore to grace earth or she is suffering from some sort of profound derangement. Her unhealthy obsession with Russia has led her to accuse Russia of the impossible, the obscure and the inane.Perhaps it is all contrived, some sort of plot and she’ll one day admit that she’s just joking. But she’s kept a straight face for quite a while now.As a humanitarian, I do hope that she receives the psychiatric help she deserves.Now, as always when it comes to a post on this unhinged loser, let’s listen to some Russian music together and remind Louise Mensch about the culture she says is non-existant.   








via Sun-GazingDry ice has been used in many interesting endeavors and the hunks of frozen carbon dioxide never cease to amaze us. While it’s most widely known and used for keeping perishable food items frozen during transit, that hasn’t stopped inventive humans from incorporating it into everything from school science projects to chemotherapy, rockets, bug removal, fire extinguishers, fog machines, removing skin tags or moles, and so much more.While the majority of these alternative types of uses play a specific role and serve a higher purpose, some dry ice tricks are simply for fun and entertainment. That’s exactly what this video of dry ice being tossed into a swimming pool is about; good old-fashioned fun!The interesting concept was dreamed up and brought to light by one of YouTube’s most hilarious personalities, the Crazy Russian Hacker.He’s full of cool ideas and whether it’s conducting random experiments, testing out new gadgets, or sharing his favorite life hacks, he’s always up to something wild and strange. For this particular project he decided to see exactly what would happen if thirty pounds of dry ice were dumped straight into a backyard swimming pool.Long story short, it’s pretty awesome!The clip opens with the Crazy Russian hanging out poolside with an empty cooler, a pair of insulated gloves, and several bags of dry ice. He gets right down to it and starts breaking up the ice blocks into smaller chunks over the empty cooler. Since his motto is “safety is the number one priority” he works with gloves on both hands to protect his skin against dry ice burns. Once the container is full of dry ice he picks it up and dumps it directly into the pool!As soon as the dry ice hits the water it immediately reacts and the pool begins to bubble up. The warmer water in the pool starts to melt and break down the ice and soon a dense, thick white fog drifts off the surface before being carried away in the breeze. The combined effects make it look as if the pool is boiling and you can hear the water bubbling as all of the gasses get released. In the background you can hear the Crazy Russian Hacker commenting on how “beautiful,” “amazing,” and “awesome” it is. He’s hilarious and might be just as entertaining as the dry ice in the pool!If you’re thinking that dumping 30 pounds of dry ice in a pool may be dangerous, it’s not but only if the proper precautions are taken. Above all else, the one thing you should never do is handle it with your bare hands. Always use insulated gloves because they will prevent hands and skin from getting injured and/or burned by frostbite which occurs on contact with the stuff. One more thing to keep in mind is that if you plan on breaking it up like how the Crazy Russian Hacker did in the clip, make sure to use protective eye wear as well. I think we can all agree that it’s always best to be safe than to be sorry! Here’s more on the science behind dry ice and what it is:Dry ice is super-frozen carbon dioxide, which is the gas we exhale whenever we breathe out. It forms when carbon dioxide is exposed to extreme temperatures of at least -109° Fahrenheit. At that temperature or lower it changes from a gas straight to a solid and there is no liquid phase whatsoever in-between. The inverse of this immediate change also happens to be true of it, so when dry ice melts it goes from solid to gas. That is why and how it produces the cloudy, fog-like effect that it’s known for.Now that you have seen what thirty pounds of dry ice does to a swimming pool you can try it yourself, should you ever need to! It’s the perfect way to make a pool party memorable and everyone will love the cool, hypnotic effects. Plus, it’s highly likely that no one has ever seen anything quite like this done before and so they’re going to remember it forever.








Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times after his appointment in May 2014. Photograph: New York Times Handout/EPA(The Guardian) Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, believes his newspaper – in company with the US mainstream media – failed their audiences after 9/11.He told the German news magazine Der Spiegel that he agreed with the criticism originally made by an NYT reporter, James Risen,Baquet said: “The mainstream press was not aggressive enough after 9/11, was not aggressive enough in asking questions about a decision to go to war in Iraq, was not aggressive enough in asking the hard questions about the war on terror. I accept that for the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times”.The New York Times HQ.Photograph: Richard Drew/APBaquet, in charge of the NYT since May 2014, was previously editor-in-chief of the LA Times. In his wide-ranging interview with Der Spiegel, Baquet also spoke about the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden having chosen to tell his story to the Guardian.He said he regards the Guardian as “a new competitor [for the NYT]in the digital age.” He said: “Does it make me nervous that they compete with us and in fact beat us on the Snowden story? Yes.Der Spiegel asked: “How painful was it as an institution that Edward Snowden didn’t approach the New York Times?” Baquet replied:It hurt a lot. It meant two things. Morally, it meant that somebody with a big story to tell didn’t think we were the place to go, and that’s painful. And then it also meant that we got beaten on what was arguably the biggest national security story in many, many years.Not only beaten by the Guardian, because he went to the Guardian, but beaten by the [Washington] Post, because he went to a writer from the Post. We tried to catch up and did some really good stories that I feel good about. But it was really, really, really painful.It was suggested that Snowden didn’t approach the NYT because it had refused to publish the initial research about the NSA’s bulk collection in 2004. Edward SnowdenAsked whether it was mistake to have held back on that reporting, Baquet pointed out, reasonably enough, that he wasn’t at the NYT at the time.The magazine also asked Baquet about digital rivals, citing a leak of an internal NYT document saying that its “journalistic advantage” was shrinking in the face of online competitors. Baquet said:We assumed wrongly that these new competitors, whether it was BuzzFeed or others, were doing so well just because they were doing something journalistically that we chose not to do. We were arrogant to be honest.We looked down on those new competitors, and I think we’ve come to realize that was wrong. They understood before we did how to make their stories available to people who are interested in them. We were too slow to do it.Given that print still accounts for three-quarters of the paper’s revenues, Der Spiegel asked: “How can you establish a ‘digital first’ culture in the newsroom when your balance sheet demands ‘print first’?” Baquet replied:I always thought that digital first was a simplistic notion, and I am not even sure quite what it means. It should be stories first. Let’s take the Paris [Charlie Hebdo] story.We covered it all day, we held nothing back. Everything we learned, we published online. Then, when you approach your print deadline, you have to do two things. You have to polish those stories that are online because print is less forgiving of mistakes.Secondly, in an ideal world, you pick one thing that will feel fresh and compelling to people in the morning when they pick up the print paper.Source: Der Spiegel

Lawmakers brushed aside complaints from Democrats that Friedman lacked the temperament for such a top-flight diplomatic post. At his Senate confirmation hearing in February, Friedman acknowledged making comments about former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and liberal Jewish advocacy groups that some critics felt were incendiary.

Lake County, FL — In a testament to the sheer lack of oversight and accountability of police officers, two of the most apparently incompetent Florida cops were allowed to patrol a school with nearly two thousand children. The cops would frequently be seen ‘playing around’ with their tasers. However, all that would come to a halt when Master Deputy Raymond Mattiucci accidentally shot a Leesburg High School employee with a taser, knocking him unconscious and leaving him with a broken wrist.After Mattiucci’s dangerous and irresponsible mistake, he and Deputy Darrell Blanton then conspired to cover it all up — leaving the victim, Jerome Scott, and a witness, Pamela Nash, fearing for their safety.“These deputies failed to immediately report a serious incident to their supervisor and then compounded the issue by being less than truthful,” Lake Sheriff Peyton Grinnell wrote in an email. “As law enforcement officers, we are held to the highest of standards and that type of conduct should not and will not be tolerated.”As the Orlando Sentinel reports:Mattiucci and Blanton had a history of playing around with their tasers on school property, once pretending to tase the security monitor and pointing it “lights flashing” at the face of Leesburg High employee Pamela Nash, according to interviews with sheriff’s investigators. The deputies kept tabs on Scott and Nash, who witnessed the incident, through text messages and face-to-face inquiries during the following week, the report said. Nash was alone with Mattiucci and Scott in her classroom when she heard a “pop” sound and saw Scott reaching for the countertop and falling face first on the floor, the report said.After Scott fell to the ground, it would be 15 minutes before he could even speak. He also suffered a broken wrist.After he accidentally tasered the innocent man, Mattiucci radioed for Blanton who quickly came to his aid and helped to cover it up. Blanton then called dispatch and told them a school employee “fell.”Mattiucci reportedly convinced Scott and Nash to keep quiet and promised to pay for Scott’s insurance deductible for his broken wrist. However, that never happened.When Scott asked Mattiucci for the money, Mattiucci began avoiding him. Weeks later, Blanton, in a seeming act of intimidation, approached Nash, asking her, “Did you tell?” according to investigators. Then, Mattiucci texted Scott that same day in a similar manner saying, “What’s the word … Our Corp is about poking his nose around.”After this intimidation, both high school employees became fearful of coming forward, obviously scared of what these two cops could do to them. During the investigation, it was also revealed that Mattiucci and Blanton were keeping tabs on Scott and Nash — indicating that they had every reason to be wary.According to the Orlando Sentinel, these sadistic cops even had the nerve to keep pretending that they were going to taser Scott. Nash lost sleep over the ordeal and Scott once before told the two deputies not to playfully enact using the taser on him, but Blanton said that even though he could tell Scott was scared, he thought it was funny, the report said.However, after living in fear long enough, Nash finally came forward and reported the two deputies. During the investigation, both officers were placed on paid leave and were accused of two violations —  “departure from the truth” and conduct unbecoming of an officer.Before he could be held accountable for his actions, Mattiucci was allowed to resign on March 8. However, Blanton, apparently thinking he was going to get away with it, stayed around and was then fired on March 15.For tasering an innocent man, endangering his life, causing injury, and then employing intimidation and conspiring to cover it up — neither of these two cops was charged with a crime.

Pop country star Taylor Swift, herself accused by die-hard genre fans of watering down the definition of ‘country’, has reportedly pleaded with Hillary Clinton to pull her presidential campaign song off the airwaves.“Please Hillary, the lyrics are making me gack up my brunch.  You’re giving country music like a really bad name,” the singer reportedly pleaded.“It makes the ‘Obama Girl’ song seem good,” said one uninformed (but sadly correct) bystander we chose to quote.The Hillary Clinton twangy new country song by a singer who asked to remain anonymous has also left previous supporters scratching their heads.According to her campaign manager, “This song is a bold attempt to reach country people (codeword: white trash), and is not at all out of touch. This is what Those People listen to.”“Next we just need a rap song for inner city types (codeword: black) and she’ll win. It’s all about the music, man. It shows Them that she gets it.  She’s one of Them.”Nevertheless, despite the blithe confidence of Hillary’s team, the song has not proven to be a hit. It has been alternatively called the “worst thing since Caligula”, and “perfectly capturing America’s grim decline”, neither of which are messages Hillary Clinton presumably wants to sendKimberly Kimbelton

	Imagine how it must feel to be on the Russian side, as across the Pacific Ocean one side of the political aisle and their mainstream media constantly blames you for their loss in a democratic election. Day by day the conspiracies get wilder and wilder, and more and more blame gets put onto you, alleging that you have now infiltrated the highest levels of their government. You would eventually get sick of it, and it looks like the Russians may have reached that point.

	

	In the following video, Right Wing News looks at a recent statement by Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova which ends with the foreign minister saying the following:

	“Also, I would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia, which has become a tradition in Washington in the past few years, continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret, for example, things that happened during President Obama’s terms in office. Believe me, this could be very interesting information.” 

	At the rate the left and the dishonest media continue their misguided witch hunt for a non-existent Russian boogeyman, it may only be a matter of time before Russia has some leaks of their own. What do you think the Obama administration has to hide?

	Russia has threatened to publish embarrassing and potentially incriminating secrets about the Obama administration, according to an extraordinary statement by the Foreign Ministry. 

	According to Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova, Russia may “publish leaks” about “secrets” the Obama administration pleaded with the Russian government to keep private.

	Thegatewaypundit.com reports:

	As per mid.ru:

	Question: How do you see the future of Russian-US diplomatic relations in the context of the current atmosphere in Washington? Can you confirm that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will come to Moscow in April?

	Maria Zakharova: Apparently, many volumes have been written about the development of Russian-US relations. I announced the release of the Foreign Ministry’s yearend Diplomatic Bulletin and even showed it at the previous briefing. I believe that about 20 per cent of that bulletin was devoted to Russian-US relations, the way we see them, how we want them to develop, what we expect from Washington, what we are willing to do with the United States, the priority areas of cooperation, areas where our cooperation should be revived without delay and the areas where this can wait, at least for a limited time. This issue has been covered in interviews by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, comments by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and in numerous statements made at all levels by representatives from various Russian agencies, political analysts and politicians, as well as officials from the legislative and executive authorities. We can talk about bilateral relations with a different degree of mastery, but we would like to start implementing our relationship at long last.

	We provided our views on bilateral relations and the reasons for blocking them under President Obama. We said that we were willing to work with the new US administration, under President Trump. I don’t think we need to invent anything in this respect, because so much has been said before. Simply, we should start concrete practical work. We are ready for this.

	(function(d, s, id) {
    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
    js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;

    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
    }(document, "script", "aweber-wjs-ymm1f2upj"));

	You know that we always invite our American colleagues and diplomats to join bilateral or multilateral dialogues on issues in which the United States has traditionally played a big and active role, such as Syria, the consultations in Astana and many others. We expect Washington to formulate its foreign policy approaches in the form of a concept. We are ready for pragmatic and specific work on the principles that we have described many times.

	As for the visit by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the information about it, this is what I can say. It’s not a secret that preparations for any visit include the coordination of the time when it can be announced. Visits by foreign ministers are public events that are never kept secret. At least, I don’t know about any secret visits by foreign ministers in Russia or the United States. Preparations for such a visit also include the coordination of the format, agenda and the date it can be announced to the public. It is a matter of propriety and respect for each other’s interests. One side proposes a date, and the other side is expected to accept it. This date should be acceptable to both sides, because the foreign ministers have packed schedules. The issue also concerns the coordination of the agenda by experts. One side informs the other side of the issues it plans to discuss, and the other side needs to respond that the agenda is acceptable. In other words, the sides need to reach agreements on many issues, after which they can announce an upcoming visit. This is how we work with our colleagues.

	To tell the truth, over the past few years we’ve seen many strange things happen in Washington in connection with preparations for visits or talks by our foreign ministers. The US Department of State has more than once asked us not to announce planned visits until the last minute. This is not our tradition. We have been operating openly for years, but we have respected the requests we have received from our colleagues in Washington in the past few years. But what happened after that? First, the US Department of State asked us to keep the planned visit quiet and not to announce it until the last possible minute, until we coordinated the date. We did as they asked. But a day or two later the information was leaked by the US State Department and sometimes by the US administration. Frankly, this put Russia and the media in a strange situation, because they didn’t know who to believe – the official agencies or the many leaks.

	It is difficult to say if this diplomatic communication is a US tradition or the latest technique. But it definitely doesn’t correspond to our traditions. We believe that everything we coordinate should be made available to the media in accordance with diplomatic procedure. When we coordinate a visit and the date for announcing it, the information should be made public calmly and as agreed. This is what we do in relations with our colleagues from other countries.

	As I said, such cases in our relations with the US Department of State have become a bad tradition over the past few years. So, I can say in response to your question that we will make the date and format of contacts between the Russian and US foreign ministers public after we coordinate them. We won’t keep them quiet. At this point, I don’t have any information I can share with you. I can say that this visit and such contacts are possible in principle, but it would be premature to talk about timeframes.

	Also, I would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia, which has become a tradition in Washington in the past few years, continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret, for example, things that happened during President Obama’s terms in office. Believe me, this could be very interesting information.

	Our American colleagues must decide if they respect the diplomatic procedure, if they keep their word on the arrangements made between us, primarily arrangements made at their own request, or we create a few very nice surprises for each other.

	We can only assume that if Obama loyalists still hiding in the White House continue to leak intel, it’s inevitable that Russia will drop a bomb about Obama.

FBI Director James Comey and NSA Head, Mike Rogers have apparently refused to show up at a March 28, 2017 House Intelligence Committee classified hearing, sending messages that they would not be appearing.Both men were to be questioned about the revelation proposed by Devin Nunes (R-C) that the Trump transition team had been surveilled in November, and December of 2016, and into January of this year by Obama’s Administration – just before Trump’s inauguration and through it.This is considered quite the bombshell because it means that one presidential party was allegedly spying on another using the U.S. Intelligence agencies at its disposal, and not for maintaining national security. It is even more troubling considering the Democrats were blaming Russian spies for trying to interfere in the US election process.Director of the FBI, James ComeyAs Nunes has stated,“None of this intelligence collection was related to Russia or investigations of Russian activities or the Trump team.“The U.S. Intelligence Community on numerous occasions collected information on U.S. citizens involved with the Trump transition.”Nunes also said this collection may have been legal and called it “incidental.”“Details associated with U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no intelligence value, were widely disseminated in Intelligence Community reporting,” he continued.The information purportedly comes from whistleblower Dennis Montgomery, who is being represented by lawyer, Larry Klayman. Klayman was to attend the hearing today, but it did not happen.It is likely that Klayman would be asking questions which Comey did not want to answer.Head of the NSA, Michael S. RogersTo wit, Nunes had asked that the following questions be put to Comey and Rogers in the Intelligence Committee hearing:“Who was aware of this collection?Why was this collection not disclosed to Congress?Who requested and authorized the additional unmasking of the names of Trump officials from intelligence reporting?Whether anyone directed the Intelligence Community to focus on Trump associates.Whether laws, procedures or regulations were broken.”Aside from the head of the FBI and NSA shirking their national duties by being present at a classified conference, it is hard to miss that the very heads of institutions which were set up to spy on American people are now being subjected to their own “rules” of war.Some suggest the information collection by the FBI and NSA was aimed at gathering data that could be leaked to the press and then to subsequently hurt Trump’s reputation during the election.Even when a member of Congress is surveilled by the FBI or NSA, they are supposed to destroy the information unless it is important for national security, not disseminated widely in the field, so what exactly what the Obama team trying to accomplish?Is it possible that what Comey and Rogers were about to be exposed for – politically-motivated spying – the very same type of surveillance that innocent American people have had to endure since the Patriot Act?As the saying goes, “You can run, boys, but you can’t hide.” If Comey and Rogers are trying to flee from larger truths, the public will eventually find out, as the number of whistleblowers willing to blow the lid off business-as-usual in Washington, are growing.Image: Source, Source

“For every 10 women rescued, there are 50 to 100 more women are brought in by the traffickers. Unfortunately, they’re not 18- or 20-year-olds anymore. They’re minors as young as 13 who are being trafficked. They’re little girls.”—25-year-old victim of trafficking“Children are being targeted and sold for sex in America every day.”—John Ryan, National Center for Missing & Exploited ChildrenTND Guest Contributor:  John W. Whitehead | The mysterious disappearance of 18-year-old Hannah Graham on September 13, 2014, has become easy fodder for the media at a time when the news cycle is lagging. After all, how does a young woman just vanish without a trace, in the middle of the night, in a town that is routinely lauded for being the happiest place in America, not to mention one of the most beautiful?Yet Graham is not the first girl to vanish in America without a trace—my hometown of Charlottesville, Va., has had five women go missing over the span of five years—and it is doubtful she will be the last. I say doubtful because America is in the grip of a highly profitable, highly organized and highly sophisticated sex trafficking business that operates in towns large and small, raking in upwards of $9.5 billion a year in the U.S. alone by abducting and selling young girls for sex.It is estimated that there are 100,000 to 150,000 under-aged sex workers in the U.S. The average age of girls who enter into street prostitution is between 12 and 14 years old, with some as young as 9 years old. This doesn’t include those who entered the “trade” as minors and have since come of age. Rarely do these girls enter into prostitution voluntarily. As one rescue organization estimated, an underaged prostitute might be raped by 6,000 men during a five-year period of servitude.This is America’s dirty little secret.You don’t hear much about domestic sex trafficking from the media or government officials, and yet it infects suburbs, cities and towns across the nation. According to the FBI, sex trafficking is the fastest growing business in organized crime, the second most-lucrative commodity traded illegally after drugs and guns. It’s an industry that revolves around cheap sex on the fly, with young girls and women who are sold to 50 men each day for $25 apiece, while their handlers make $150,000 to $200,000 per child each year.In order to avoid detection by police and cater to male buyers’ demand for sex with different women, pimps and the gangs and crime syndicates they work for have turned sex trafficking into a highly mobile enterprise, with trafficked girls, boys and women constantly being moved from city to city, state to state, and country to country. The Baltimore-Washington area, referred to as The Circuit, with its I-95 corridor dotted with rest stops, bus stations and truck stops, is a hub for the sex trade.With a growing demand for sexual slavery and an endless supply of girls and women who can be targeted for abduction, this is not a problem that’s going away anytime soon. Young girls are particularly vulnerable, with 13 being the average age of those being trafficked. Yet as the head of a group that combats trafficking pointed out, “Let’s think about what average means. That means there are children younger than 13. That means 8-, 9-, 10-year-olds.”Consider this: every two minutes, a child is exploited in the sex industry. In Georgia alone, it is estimated that 7,200 men (half of them in their 30s) seek to purchase sex with adolescent girls each month, averaging roughly 300 a day. It is estimated that at least 100,000 children—girls and boys—are bought and sold for sex in the U.S. every year, with as many as 300,000 children in danger of being trafficked each year. Some of these children are forcefully abducted, others are runaways, and still others are sold into the system by relatives and acquaintances.As one news center reported, “Finding girls is easy for pimps. They look on MySpace, Facebook, and other social networks. They and their assistants cruise malls, high schools and middle schools. They pick them up at bus stops. On the trolley. Girl-to-girl recruitment sometimes happens.” Foster homes and youth shelters have also become prime targets for traffickers.With such numbers, why don’t we hear more about this? Especially if, as Ernie Allen of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children insists, “this is not a problem that only happens in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco. This happens in smaller communities. The only way not to find this in any American city is simply not to look for it.”Unfortunately, Americans have become good at turning away from things that make us uncomfortable or stray too far from our picture-perfect images of ourselves. In this regard, we’re all complicit in contributing to this growing evil which, for all intents and purposes, is out in the open: advertising on the internet, commuting on the interstate, operating in swanky hotels, taking advantage of a system in which the police, the courts and the legislatures are more interested with fattening their coffers by targeting Americans for petty violations than actually breaking up crime syndicates.Writing for the Herald-Tribune, reporter J. David McSwane has put together one of the most chilling and insightful investigative reports into sex trafficking in America. “The Stolen Ones” should be mandatory reading for every American, especially those who still believe it can’t happen in their communities or to their children because it’s mainly a concern for lower income communities or immigrants.As McSwane makes clear, no community is safe from this danger, and yet very little is being done to combat it. Indeed, although police agencies across the country receive billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment, weapons and training that keeps them busy fighting a losing battle against marijuana, among other less pressing concerns, very little time and money is being invested in the fight against sex trafficking except for the FBI’s annual sex trafficking sting, which inevitably makes national headlines for the numbers of missing girls recovered.For those trafficked, it’s a nightmare from beginning to end. Those being sold for sex have an average life expectancy of seven years, and those years are a living nightmare of endless rape, forced drugging, humiliation, degradation, threats, disease, pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages, torture, pain, and always the constant fear of being killed or, worse, having those you love hurt or killed. A common thread woven through most survivors’ experiences is being forced to go without sleep or food until they have met their sex quota of at least 40 men. One woman recounts how her trafficker made her lie face down on the floor when she was pregnant and then literally jumped on her back, forcing her to miscarry.Holly Austin Smith was abducted when she was 14 years old, raped, and then forced to prostitute herself. Her pimp, when brought to trial, was only made to serve a year in prison. Barbara Amaya was repeatedly sold between traffickers, abused, shot, stabbed, raped, kidnapped, trafficked, beaten, and jailed all before she was 18 years old. “I had a quota that I was supposed to fill every night. And if I didn’t have that amount of money, I would get beat, thrown down the stairs. He beat me once with wire coat hangers, the kind you hang up clothes, he straightened it out and my whole back was bleeding.”As McSwane recounts: “In Oakland Park, an industrial Fort Lauderdale suburb, federal agents in 2011 encountered a brothel operated by a married couple. Inside ‘The Boom Boom Room,’ as it was known,  customers paid a fee and were given a condom and a timer and left alone with one of the brothel’s eight teenagers, children as young as 13. A 16-year-old foster child testified that he acted as security, while a 17-year-old girl told a federal judge she was forced to have sex with as many as 20 men a night.”One particular sex trafficking ring that was busted earlier in 2014 caters specifically to migrant workers employed seasonally on farms throughout the southeastern states, especially the Carolinas and Georgia, although it’s a flourishing business in every state in the country. Traffickers transport the women from farm to farm, where migrant workers would line up outside shacks, as many as 30 at a time, to have sex with them before they were transported to yet another farm where the process would begin all over again.What can you do?Call on your city councils, elected officials and police departments to make the battle against sex trafficking a top priority, more so even than the so-called war on terror and drugs and the militarization of law enforcement.Insist that law enforcement agencies in the country at all levels, local, state and federal, funnel their resources into fighting the crime of sex trafficking. Stop prosecuting adults for victimless “crimes” such as growing lettuce in their front yard and focus on putting away the pimps and buyers who victimize these young women.Educate yourselves and your children about this growing menace in our communities. The future of America is at stake. As YouthSpark, a group that advocates for young people points out, sex trafficking is part of a larger continuum in America that runs the gamut from homelessness, poverty, and self-esteem issues to sexualized television, the glorification of a pimp/ho culture—what is often referred to as the pornification of America—and a billion dollar sex industry built on the back of pornography, music, entertainment, etc.Stop feeding the monster. This epidemic is largely one of our own making, especially in a corporate age where the value placed on human life takes a backseat to profit. The U.S. is a huge consumer of trafficked “goods,” with national sporting events such as the Super Bowl serving as backdrops for the sex industry’s most lucrative seasons. Each year, for instance, the Super Bowl serves as a “windfall” for sex traffickers selling minors as young as 13 years old. As one sex trafficking survivor explained, “They’re coming to the Super Bowl not even to watch football. They’re coming to the Super Bowl to have sex with women and/or men or children.”Finally, as the Abell Foundation’s report on trafficking advises: the police need to do a better job of training on, identifying and responding to these issues; communities and social services need to do a better job of protecting runaways, who are the primary targets of traffickers; legislators need to pass legislation aimed at prosecuting traffickers and “johns,” the buyers who drive the demand for sex slaves; hotels need to stop enabling these traffickers, by providing them with rooms and cover for their dirty deeds; and “we the people” need to stop hiding our heads in the sand and acting as if there are other matters more pressing.Those concerned about the police state in America, which I document in my book A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State, should be equally concerned about the sex trafficking trade in America. It is only made possible by the police state’s complicity in turning average Americans into suspects for minor violations while letting the real criminals wreak havoc on our communities. No doubt about it, these are two sides of the same coin.# # # # #John W.

Just when you think he might start focusing on America, the economy and other important issues, Trump veers off into another Twitter tantrum. The latest one is his dislike for a generation of ‘Bad Kids’ which he blames on ‘Rapp’ (sic) music and former President Obama. This is a disrespectful outburst toward a girl who lost her life today. A very low move for the President:

        SakerNice. Thanks.Some folks that I’ve been listening to recently (as youtube “magically” noticed when I opened your link ;D )НУКИ @ 16 ТОНН – ALL STAR TV 2016https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WK0U1bY6HUkhi vt – I’m not too crazy about that either, but I like this one, which I learned from you  – fight club –  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1LMJ7xpDm4great lyricsit never ceases to amaze me how versatile the electric guitar is….a totally different music but another way to use an electric guitar –  the slide –https://youtu.be/Ij5tUsRg2S0Sorry dear Saker, I don’t like Baroque either.L…. AnnYour link does not seem to work. Please fix.  – fk modQuite nice Saker, though Jazz mostly passes me by.Here is Bach – Richter, Conciertos de Brandenburgo 1-6, BWV 1046-1051 https://youtu.be/Ehbar90jHz8  Recorded Moscow Conservatory, 28th March 1978. A fair amount of spiel before they get going “it is only Richter who can perform Bach’s music” etc etc says the commentator with the becoming modesty of a true Russian.Someone made a lovely comment a bit long, but it sums  up the music rather well to a large extent. I hope I’m aloud to repost it here . . . “The look in Richter’s eyes when he’s waiting for the director’s sign to start (2:56) strikes me. It reminds me of a orangutan or a great silverback gorilla. I can only try to imagine why this is the case: it is the same look my old seasoned and hugely experienced sailing shipper had in his eyes when looking out over the sea, standing on his 60 foot two-masted wooden sailing vessel. It is a look of perfect calm and concentration, a look of 100% mindfulness if you like, a fully focused mind. Beautiful. And it shows, in the music.I was born a month after this recording, and looking at my father’s taste in music, I have probably heard this piece and others on a regular basis before I was born. And in some way, hearing Richter playing stuff like this feels like coming home and knowing myself on the deepest level possible, odd how that may sound. It makes my life, and life in general, worth living. It makes everything all-right. What a re-assurance. There is no need to worry, you may, but it’s okay. It will all come to right. Everything is okay, everything will be okay. There is no disaster that will not pass, no grievance that cannot be overcome, no hatred big enough that it cannot be turned into sadness, no sadness dark enough that it cannot turn into new-found joy. There is eternal comfort. Probably what Sam meant when standing on Mount Doom, suddenly looking up at the stars, suddenly realizing that there is eternal beauty, forever beyond the grasp of destruction. Very, very strange indeed, that music can evoke feelings like that, which are almost religious. Could it be that we are hearing the voice of God? I do not care much for religion in general, in my mind it’s a social construct born out of a need for guidelines and security. But here I am, not looking for guidelines or security, just feeling a bit lost in the depths of time amidst the innumerable stars (more Tolkien for you right there) in a universe without meaning or purpose other than what we make of it – I had accepted it fully. And then suddenly, there is this music, and against all knowledge, while knowing better, I am suddenly sure that everything will be allright. The music communicates a truth of beauty and joy that dwarfs any other philosophical / mathematical / scientific truth that I may have arrived at at a later age. And it’s a truth that is not alien, it’s something that I have always known and felt all my life. . .”that’s a wonderul comment and I love the link too. Thanks – I guess I do like some Baroque – Bach especially –Woa that all looked a bit weird, plus some of my comment not there, … another try:Sviatoslav Richter (1915-1997) plays Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). Recorded on the 28th of March, 1978 at the Moscow Conservatory.https://youtu.be/2kHXLd-aqpM  Begins at 6.57P.S, Worse and worse, one part of my missing comment was to write that the comment was not mine,  that appears above, highlighted,  but taken from the utube link – and the bit of comment of mine that did appear, that I did not highlight either, is also highlighted.
Bach played by Richter is surely worth the hassle!Toccata and Fugue – by Richter.Used to listen to it constantly in my teens.Still sublime after all these years….:-)Thanks for this Saker. I find this music is very moving. There are many great musicians in Canada. The same can not be said about our politicians.There is a god.– ShyakuGorgeous, thanks.
This one, also quite remarkable

Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, the current Taliban leader. Click to enlargeThe Taliban may be poised to seize control of major cities in Afghanistan for the first time since the US-backed intervention ousted the Islamist group from power in 2001, serving and former Afghan officials have warned.The warnings come amid growing concern about the emergence of a “pro-Taliban axis,” including Russia, Iran, and China, who see the group as a bulwark against the Islamic State terror group and would like to see US and other Western powers ousted from the country.The resurgence of the Taliban was epitomised by the fall on Thursday of Sangin, the strategic town in Helmand province which 100 British soldiers died trying to defend.The Taliban’s seizure of Sangin was seen by many as inevitable. Western and government control of the town was always tenuous, even at the height of fighting in the area, and the Taliban already runs extortion rackets and makes money from poppy farmers and heroin processing labs in the area.But its loss was still a major blow because of the town’s strategic significance as the gateway to central and western Afghanistan. The town sits astride Highway 611, the road that connects Kabul with Kandhar and the strategic district of Greashak.Control of Sangin will give the Taliban a launch pad for attacks on the provincial capital of Lashkargah.Hashim Alokozay, the senator for Helmand and a native of the Sangin district, told the Sunday Telegraph abandoning the town was “the wrong decision.”“The district of Sangin was surrounded for 14 months by Taliban. The forces couldn’t get reinforcements and supplies. So the government failed soldiers. They left the district,” he said. “The Taliban will now be able to recruit more people into their ranks. So with the government leaving Sangin to Taliban… Lashkargah is surrounded.”The setback reflects the central government’s tenuous hold on not only on its outlying regions, but key areas like the economy.As the West winds down its presence in Afghanistan, the central government has failed to effectively grapple with soaring inflation and unemployment, and a consequently a high crime rateA resurgent Taliban – and increasingly other outside powers – are filling the vacuum. In some parts of the country under its control the jihadists are assuming the role of a Hezbollah-type group that finds legitimacy by supplying some services and security.The group appear to be focusing on extending their control of Afghanistans rich mineral resources, including selling black market rubies, emeralds and gold from mines in Badakhshan and marble quarries in Helmand province.And it is not just the Taliban who are filling a vacuum left by the diminished US and Western presence.In February, what appeared to be Chinese military vehicles were photographed on patrol in the remote area of Northeastern Afghanistan that borders China’s Xinxiang province – the first sign that Beijing has felt compelled to secure its own interests in the country.Meanwhile, Russia has stepped up talks with factions including the Taliban, and has even been accused by US military chiefs of supplying weapons to the militants.Both Beijing and Moscow have interest national security interests in the country. China wants to prevent the country being used as a safe haven by Uighur groups fighting an insurgency in its Xinjiang province, and has struck an alliance with Pakistan. Russia is keen to contain the flow of opium and extremists into former Soviet Central Asia.But some fear there are other motives at work.“There is an emerging Taliban Axis comprising of Pakistan, China, Russia, and Iran. They are united in two things: evicting US from Afghanistan and combating Daesh,” Dr Dawood Moradian, director for Afghan institute for strategic studies in Kabul, said on Friday.Afghan Security forces defeated by Taliban fighters in southern Helmand province. Click to enlargeAmid an ongoing crisis in relations between Russia and the West, Moscow’s activity has raised particular concern in Washington.“I’ve seen the influence of Russia of late – increased influence in terms of association and perhaps even supply to the Taliban,” Army General Curtis Scaparotti, Nato’s Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, told a Senate hearing in Washington on Thursday. Last month another US commander, Gen John Nicholson, said Russia and Iran were both pursuing policies there in part designed “to undermine the United States and Nato.”The generals appeared to be referring to unconfirmed reports of weapons without serial numbers, including machine guns and grenade launchers, crossing the border of Tajikistan, where Russia maintains a military presence. They presented no evidence to back up the claims.The Russian government has called the comments “absurd” and accused the generals of seeking to justify further military spending and find a scapegoat for the US’s failure to bring stability to Afghanistan over the past 16 years.“General Scaparotti’s report does not deserve serious analysis,” the Russian ministry of defence said in a statement on Friday.“Not one fact, figure, or document – just the same slogans, only now in new formats, and absurd accusations,” it added.   None the less, Russia’s consultations with the Taliban are no secret, and Moscow may view the increasingly powerful group as a possible counterweight to Isil, which appeared in the country last year.“As long as the Talibs have a conflict with Isil, it would make sense for Russia to have contact with them,” said Omar Mohammed Amir Nessar, an expert on Afghanistan at the Russian Academy of Science’s Institute of Eastern Affairs in Moscow.He dismissed the US claims of Russia going so far as to supply weapons as “information warfare.” “For one thing, there’s no guarantee the weapons you supply will stay with the faction you give them to,” he said.Few experts believe Aghanistan will face a repetition of the collapse of central government that followed the Soviet withdrawal in 1989. Western powers, and the United States in particular, still maintain a military presence and financial support to the Kabul government.And while the central authorities are weak and fractious, so are the Taliban, points out Sir William Patey, former British Ambassador.“No one will want to inherit this crock of the proverbial,” he said.“We just didn’t have the stamina – we always rush to hand things over to the locals, which is very laudable, but we did it before the institutions had been build. But this kind of thing really takes 20 or 30 years,” he added. “We’re in for a long period of instability,” he said.Source








10th day into demonetisation and things are going from bad to worse.  There is mayhem everywhere.  We have already had reports of suicides, murders, robberies, cyclones, earthquakes, and Rohit Sharma’s ouster from Indian squad because of demonetisation, and now we have the first case of HIV that this dreadful ban has caused.The incident happened when a man contracted the disease from an already infected ATM machine in Mumbai.  Despite numerous warnings issued by India Today and other media houses about ATM keypads transmitting the virus, he went to an ATM and touched the dangerous keypad.  He was later diagnosed with HIV positive.“So did he actually have sex with the machine?” we asked an insider from India Today.“No, but withdrawing cash is as good as having sex with the machine.  You have more or less the same feeling when you get the cash in your hand,” he affirmed.“Ok that’s interesting.  So the engineering students are not virgins anymore and they can proudly brag about their sex lives.”“Well, technically speaking, yes, they can.”“So, who is at risk of catching the virus?  Someone with a poor immune system?”“No, anyone who is withdrawing cash from an ATM.”“You mean, balance inquiries and other transactions are safe, right?”“Who stands in the queue for 3 hours to check balance?”“Oh ok, you are talking about the current scenario.”“Yes, people should avoid an ATM machine at any cost because it may cause STD as our researcher suggested, and once you are infected with an STD, you become more susceptible to HIV infection.”“And who is the researcher at India Today you are referring to? Is it Rajdeep Sardesai?”“No, he is in Goa.  The person who published the report is Jane Carlton.”“Ok but the report was published in 2014.  Why are you linking it to currency ban?”“Because it’s always relevant.”“But what made you search the report two years after it was published and exactly at a time when people are desperately trying to use ATMs?  We are just curious, what was going through your mind when you decided to look it up and what were the keywords you entered into Google that returned this report?”“Listen, I think I am done with the interview.  If you have more questions then ask Rajdeep Sardesai.  I am going to call him.  Here are your boxing gloves.”“But you said he is in Goa,” we hurriedly wrapped-up the interview.








Donald J. Trump was rushed offstage by security guards not long after he began speaking on Saturday night at a rally in Reno, Nev., in a startling scene that was not immediately explained.Via NewYorkTimesTwo members of Mr. Trump’s security detail raced toward Mr. Trump, with one of them grabbing him and forcibly escorting him away from the lectern. Moments before, Mr. Trump had seemed to notice a commotion in the crowd in front of him. As he was led away, video from the event appeared to show people near the stage subduing someone in the audience.Soon after, police officers escorted a man into a bathroom away from the crowd. Several officers followed him inside, and several more stayed outside, guarding the door. With Mr. Trump off the stage, some in the crowd in the Reno-Sparks Convention Center grew confused and panicked.“What’s going on?” asked one woman, leaning over the metal barricades to inquire if the news media had any information. “Are we in danger?” A few minutes later, Mr. Trump returned to the same lectern and indirectly addressed the matter.“Nobody said it would be easy for us,” he said. “But we will never be stopped. Never. Ever.” He added: “I want to thank the Secret Service. They don’t get enough credit. They are amazing people.”








Trump lawyer Michael Cohen says the president’s greatness convinced him to register as a Republican this month but his new Republican Party leadership post surely didn’t hurt.Three weeks after becoming a Republican (and five months after his boss won the presidency), Cohen, President Donald Trump’s private attorney and spokesman, will join the Republican National Committee’s finance leadership team, according to a draft of an RNC press release obtained by the Daily Beast.Cohen describes himself as Trump’s “fix-it guy,” a loyal lieutenant who has handled his international business deals, defamation lawsuits, and everything in between. Cohen resigned from the Trump Organization earlier this year and is now on the the president’s personal payroll.His precise duties for Trump were still fluid in the aftermath of the inauguration, but his new post at the RNC suggests Cohen is adopting a more political role for the new president, who is already officially a candidate for reelection.Cohen refused to discuss the RNC job when reached on Tuesday evening.“When the statement comes out you’ll have your answer,” he said. He declined to address further questions about his current duties for the president.The RNC did not respond to a request for comment.A longtime Trump aide and confidante, Cohen was a public face of the presidential campaign. His spokesman duties occasionally drifted into angry, threatening tirades at journalists pursuing stories that made his boss look bad.“If you do something wrong [to Trump], I’m going to come at you, grab you by the neck and I’m not going to let you go until I’m finished,” he said in an interview last year.Cohen will now be vice-chairman of a panel of Republican moneymen who “will employ their extraordinary talent and understanding of Americans across the country to maintain and build upon our unprecedented fundraising success,” RNC finance chief Steve Wynn said in a statement in the draft press release.Cohen stands out among the eight finance team appointees announced in the RNC’s draft press release. The other names include a state party chairman and a host of high-dollar GOP donors and fundraisers.Cohen, by contrast, wasn’t even a Republican until earlier this month.READ MORE comments








The 90s had the best toys. Teenage Mutant Ninja TurtlesGameboy








by Gina Cassini | Top Right NewsDonald J. Trump addressed the U.S. Congress for the first time as President Tuesday night.And according to conservatives at FoxNews — even establishment types who opposed his candidacy — it was “one of the best speeches” by any president they had ever heard.But it is the remarks of die-hard left-wing CNN host Van Jones that is giving Democrats absolute fits tonight, and major worries about 2018.Jones, who has never missed an opportunity to slash Trump, especially with a generous application of the “race card,” unleashed some extraordinary praise on Trump’s big address after it ended.But it was what Jones said after a clip of Trump directly addressing the sobbing widow of a Navy SEAL in the gallery, that is making huge waves across Twitter tonight, especially among liberals who refuse to even accept the legitimacy of Trump’s presidency:“He became president of the United States in that moment. Period.”“He became President of the United States in that moment. Period.” @VanJones68 on Trump honoring a Navy SEAL’s widow https://t.co/NrIBVZvgRT— CNN (@CNN) March 1, 2017“There are a lot of people who have a lot of reason to be frustrated with him, to be fearful of him, to be mad of him, but that was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics period,” Jones said on CNN.“And for people who had been hoping he would become unifying, hoping that he might find someway to become presidential, they should be happy with that moment,” Jones said.And Van saved the worst news for last…“For people who have been hoping that maybe he would remain a divisive cartoon, which he often finds a way to do, they should be a little bit worried tonight. Because that thing you just saw him do, if he finds a way to do that over and over again, he’s going to be there for eight years.”OUCH!That’s how successful Trump’s speech was tonight. If he can keep this up, 2018 is looking pretty damn good.I’m proud of President Trump. He’s moving on from all of the bickering and is working hard at this challenging job.

Gov. Robert Bentley issued an executive order Thursday declaring a state of emergency in Alabama over concerns about fuel shortages in the wake of a gasoline pipeline spill that released about 250,000 gallons of gasoline south of Birmingham and shut down a major pipeline connecting refineries in Houston with the rest of the country.Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal issued a similar executive order for his state on Tuesday.The pipeline operator, Colonial Pipeline, released the following information Thursday afternoon:“Based on current projections and consultations with industry partners, parts of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina will be the first markets to be impacted by any potential disruption in supply.”“Colonial has briefed officials in these states and will continue to provide timely information to the public so that they can plan accordingly.”The executive orders will allow fuel delivery truck drivers in each state to work longer shifts and exceed maximum hour limits established by the U.S. Department of Transportation in order to prevent gasoline outages.The orders apply only to trucks that are transporting fuel to areas served by the pipeline.In addition, some suppliers have begun shipping refined gasoline by water to New York from Houston while the pipeline is shut down.The pipeline has been shut down since Friday and normally transports 1.3 million barrels per day of refined gasoline and other petroleum products from refineries in Houston to the south and eastern seaboard. The pipeline terminates at New York Harbor.Colonial Pipeline spokesman Bill Berry said the pipeline delivered the products to tank farms like the one in Pelham, which sometimes have shorter “stublines” to pump gas to third party distributors.Berry said he could not disclose how much refined gasoline from the pipeline normally went to Alabama service stations because it was proprietary information.Colonial operates a second pipeline, Line 2, parallel to the damaged line that typically carries jet fuel, diesel or other non-gasoline products like home heating oil. According to Colonial’s response information site, Line 2 is now transporting gasoline from Houston as far as western Alabama to alleviate supply concerns there.U.S. EPA personnel at the site of the spill in Shelby County say local residents are not in danger, and the spilled gasoline appears to be contained at the site and unlikely to enter the nearby Cahaba River, which is home to a number of endangered species and other sensitive wildlife.Bentley concluded his executive order by reminding all Alabama residents “it is unlawful for any person within the State of Alabama to impose unconscionable prices for the sale of any commodity during the period of a declared State of Emergency.”Source: al.comNo related posts.








Award-winning actor Ricky Davao shared his opinions about the issue of senior police officials allegedly involved in drug activity announced by President Rodrigo Duterte on his statement in 69th anniversary of Philippine Air Force at Clark Airbase, Angeles, Pampanga (Read more here: Duterte named top police generals allegedly involved in illegal drugs trade)“Alam naman natin na meron talaga. Ngayon, kung totoo yun o hindi, ang bintang sa bawat isa sa kanila, hindi natin alam.” Davao said.The five police generals are as follow: former National Capital Region Police Office director Chief Superintendent Joel Pagdilao, retired Deputy Director General Marcelo Garbo Jr, former Western Visayas police chief Chief Superintendent Bernardo Diaz, former Quezon City Police District Office director Chief Superintendent Edgardo Tinio, and Vic Loot, who is now mayor of Daanbantayan, Cebu.“Kasi, kumbaga, where there’s smoke, there’s fire.” he added.“Kung hindi talaga sila, then prove it. May korte naman, may imbestigasyon. Pero kasi marami ang lumulusot, e. So, sana yung mga ginagawa ni President Duterte, e, mag-open up talaga ng mga bagay-bagay para dumiretso naman ang takbo ng mga buhay natin” the actor said in a presscon of Dirty old Musical.He also expressed his support to the new administration. “For me, okey naman ang mga ginagawa ni President Duterte.Bakit ka naman matatakot kung wala kang ginagawang masama?” he said.Ricky Davao also agree to the implementation of orders of President Duterte like the curfew. “For me, curfew is fine, lalo na I have kids. Okey sa akin yun. Parang ang dating nga sa akin, ibinabalik lang niya yung mga simple discipline.”

A new study recently released shows that people posting the word “prayers” on Facebook is only effective 15 percent of the time.It occurs most often when complete strangers happen upon a post where another person or group of people is in trouble or going through a rough time. Many users of the popular social media platform will post the word “prayers” or “praying for you” as they skim through their news feed.Researchers attribute this lack of effectiveness in large part due to people simply posting these words but then not actually taking any time to pray about the issue.Another major reason why Facebook prayers are so ineffective is because many times fake posts are shared in order to get people to post “prayers” on them in order to help generate extra views, follows, and likes for various pages and profiles.When researchers were asked about the effectiveness of posts which required a certain number of likes and prayers in order to save a life or bring good fortune to another person, they say that so far results have been “inconclusive.”By: George R.M.

A King cobra was so thirsty, it approached villagers in southern India for aid. An extreme drought is affecting populations in southern parts of India, and it’s not just people who are suffering from the adverse climatic conditions. Some animals are bypassing their primal nature to intentionally seek out humans for aid. For example, a King cobra – which is known for being dangerous and, therefore, is avoided by most people at all costs – recently approached villagers due to being desperately thirsty. After realizing that the snake was confronting humans because it was deprived of water, a few brave individuals stepped up to help. First, a man gripped the cobra’s tail to prevent it from lashing it out at nearby humans. Then, another man splashed some water on the snake’s head to cool it down. He then extended the water bottle for the cobra to drink from and then the miraculous happened – it drank!The man was intelligent to protect himself with a snake catcher while offering water to the King cobra. Fortunately, no one was hurt and the snake’s life was saved. It was later transported to an animal care facility. A group of Chinese and Indian researchers warns that the extreme drought is likely to continue on the Indo-Gangetic plain (India’s most fertile and populous region) if the burning of fossil fuels continues unabated. Effects of failing to preserve and care for the environment will likely result in a fall in agricultural produce, which will undoubtedly compromise India’s food security.

The Republican effort to repeal Obamacare failed spectacularly this month — but not because they lacked the votes to get it done. Instead, the Republicans never tried to repeal Obamacare in the first place. Falling in line with Trump’s more moderate stance on healthcare reform, Paul Ryan and congress tried to pass a bill that many called “Obamacare 2.0.”That bill met its demise because it ultimately failed to do what the Republicans promised: to repeal Obamacare in its entirety.Now, one congressman is looking to fix the bill that failed to pass congress less than a week ago. But instead of a thorough rewrite, he’s thrown the entire thing out. His new proposal is exactly one sentence, and it tries to do precisely what Republicans have promised for the last seven years. It also looks just like several bills the House passed dozens of times before Trump took office.Read his bill on the next page:↖️ Click picture to follow me, if you’re confused!!

A footprint discovered on Mars is incredible news and I can’t believe the controversial image is hosted on an official NASA server for everyone to see. (Image HERE)What makes this image special is the fact that the print bears an uncanny resemblance to the footprints left behind by the astronauts on the Moon. One cannot simply ignore the similarity between the images.The official explanation is given in a NASA caption stating that “soil disturbed by the left front wheel of the Spirit rover evokes impressions of the first footprint on Mars.”The first footprint on Mars. They said it themselves.You might known the Spirit rover and its tracks from an image that you love sharing in the comment section whenever someone mentions Mars. This one: As you can see from the image, the tracks left behind by the Spirit rover look nothing like the footprint we’re talking about. Unlike the markings left behind by a grooved wheel, this footprint is irregular in terms of where pressure was applied: the tip and the heel. The same can be said about the moon footprint, which leads us to believe both were the result of a human wearing space boots. The crazy image has already caused the jaws of a lot of people to drop and you can’t blame them because it’s hard to dismiss the fact that they really do look like the imprint an astronaut’s boot would leave in the fine dust covering the surface of the so-called red planet. Because, you know, this is what Mars really looks like:Mars has been historically known as the red planet because of its association with war—and by extension, blood. One of the earliest recorded names given to Mars was Har decher, meaning “Red One” in Egyptian. To the naked eye, Mars appears red but the truth is NASA has been altering the color of images sent back by its rovers to hide the fact that Mars has a blue sky, not the hazy grey you’ve been seeing.If they’re tampering with such important details, one naturally has to wonder about what other aspects have been doctored.In this context, and considering the much-speculated NASA secret programs, this image could become palpable proof that humans have already been to Mars. This hypothesis is corroborated by the admissions of more than a few whistleblowers, some of whom even claimed to have participated in the top-secret missions to our planetary neighbor.So is it unreasonable of us when we ask What the Hell is going on on Mars?








Written by: Admin 3 Commentsby Melissa Breyer – Treehugger.comHouseplants have been going in and out of vogue ever since the early Greeks and Romans starting bringing their plants in from the outdoors. The Victorians loved their potted palms and the 70s wouldn’t have been the same without ferns and spider plants … everywhere. Current style dictates a lighter hand with the green things – sculptural stems and succulents rule the roost – but the truth is this: Houseplants should transcend trends. The benefits houseplants confer should make us consider them a necessity rather than an object of décor, because honestly, good health should never be out of style. If you need convincing, here are some of the ways that bringing plants inside helps us out.Inhaling brings oxygen into the body, exhaling releases carbon dioxide. During photosynthesis, plants do the opposite, of sorts: They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, making plants and people great partners when it comes to gasses. Plants help to increase oxygen levels, and our bodies appreciate that.But here’s something to know: When photosynthesis stops at night, most plants switch things up and absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. However, a few special plants – like orchids, succulents and epiphytic bromeliads – flip that script and take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Meaning, use these plants in bedrooms to keep the oxygen flowing at night.In the great outdoors, plant roots tap the groundwater table for water which then evaporates through its leaves in a process known as transpiration. Studies show that this accounts for about 10 percent of the moisture in the atmosphere! The same thing happens at home (minus the groundwater table part), which increases the humidity indoors. While this may sound unappealing during hot moist months, it’s a gift during drier months or if you live in an arid clime. According to Bayer Advanced, studies at the Agricultural University of Norway document that using plants in interior spaces decreases the incidence of dry skin, colds, sore throats and dry coughs. And other research reveals that higher absolute humidity is conducive for decreased survival and transmission of the flu virus.Pixabay/Public DomainNASA has spent a lot of time researching air quality in sealed environments, which makes sense. Extensive research by the space agency discovered a then-new concept in indoor air quality improvement in which plants play a pivtoal role: “Both plant leaves and roots are utilized in removing trace levels of toxic vapors from inside tightly sealed buildings. Low levels of chemicals such as carbon monoxide and formaldehyde can be removed from indoor environments by plant leaves alone.” When talking about the relationship between plants and space travelers, NASA notes that plants, “provide nourishment for the body when eaten as food, and houseplants improve the quality of indoor air. Plants take the carbon dioxide from air to produce oxygen that humans can breathe.”The top 10 houseplants for removing indoor pollutants, according to the agency are: Peace lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii), golden pothos (Scindapsus aures), English ivy (Hedera helix), chrysanthemum (Chrysantheium morifolium), gerbera daisy (Gerbera jamesonii), mother-in-law’s tongue (Sansevieria trifasciata ‘Laurentii’), bamboo palm (Chamaedorea sefritzii), azalea (Rhododendron simsii), red-edge dracaena (Dracaena marginata) and spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum). For more on these specific plants, see: Houseplants that clean the air.The NASA researchers recommend one potted plant per 100 square feet of indoor space.Bringing flowers or a plant while visiting a hospital patient may be verging on cliché, but so effective are plants in helping surgery patients recover that one study recommends them as a “noninvasive, inexpensive, and effective complementary medicine for surgical patients.” Plants as medicine! The study, conducted at Kansas State University, found that viewing plants during recovery from surgery led to a significant improvement in physiologic responses as evidenced by lower systolic blood pressure, and lower ratings of pain, anxiety, and fatigue as compared to patients without plants in their rooms.Another technique to decrease recovery time, as noted by Texas A&M University, is horticulture therapy in which patients are tasked with taking care of plants. The patients who physically interact with plants experience a significantly reduced recovery time after medical procedures.What? How? A number of studies with both students and workers reveals that studying or working in the presence of plants can have a pretty dramatic effect. As with simply being in nature, being around plants improves concentration, memory and productivity. Being “under the influence of plants” can increase memory retention up to 20 percent, according to a University of Michigan study.Meanwhile, two Norwegian studies found that worker productivity is greatly enhanced by the presence of plants in the office. “Keeping ornamental plants in the home and in the workplace increases memory retention and concentration,” notes Texas A&M. “Work performed under the natural influence of ornamental plants is normally of higher quality and completed with a much higher accuracy rate than work done in environments devoid of nature.”

Civilians trying to flee the besieged Isis-held enclave in west Mosul are being shot dead by Isis and Iraqi army snipers as they try to cross the Tigris River, says an eyewitness trapped inside the city with his family.In an exclusive interview with The Independent, Jasim, a 33-year old Iraqi Sunni living in west Mosul near the 5th Bridge, said: “I want to rescue my mother and take her to the eastern part, but it is dangerous. Three people were killed in our neighbourhood trying to cross the river to the eastern side. They were shot dead by the snipers.”Jasim explained that “Daesh (Isis) have snipers who cover the river bank between the 5th and 6th bridges”.“The problem is that even at night things are not that easy,” he said. “The Iraqi army, the federal police and counter-terror forces shoot anyone coming from the western side as there is curfew at night and they believe anyone coming from the western side must be a Daesh fighter.” As a result, civilians are being killed by both Iraqi army mortars and Isis snipers when they try to escape. On several occasion in the past, the Iraqi security forces have announced that they have killed Isis infiltrators seeking to cross the Tigris from the west and these may have been civilians trying to escape.Speaking about civilian casualties inside his neighbourhood, Jasim says that “dozens of civilians are killed every day, including children. Yesterday, two children were killed by a mortar shell of the Iraqi Army coming from the eastern part.” He says that Iraqi government media claims that they have “smart artillery” is quite untrue. This is confirmed privately by senior Iraqi officers, one saying that many of the civilian casualties are not being caused by air strikes, but by “Tuz” Russian-made rockets mounted on the back of vehicles, which have no guidance systems.In a grim demonstration of the danger from air attack facing anybody living in east Mosul, Jasim was himself injured in a drone attack hours after he spoke to The Independent. He has been removed to hospital but the extent of his injuries are not known.Jasim gives one of the few accounts from inside the closely besieged western part of Mosul still held by Isis, describing the increasingly desperate living conditions of at least 300,000 people trying to survive there. The interview was conducted by mobile phone late at night from inside the west part of Mosul, though Isis has in the past shot or hanged people using mobiles whom it suspects of spying on them. Though the signal was weak, messages can be passed to east Mosul, captured by government forces after three months of heavy fighting that finished in January.Referring to the growing shortage of food, Jasim says that “people in our neighbourhood are searching in the garbage to find something that can be eaten to take it to their children.” There have been no vegetables or fruit available for over a month. He and his family have a little flour and rice stored, but they want to keep it as a last resort to feed their children. He says they roam other neighbourhoods to see if they can find food there so as not to use up these last reserves before they have to.Where food is available, it is often too expensive for most people to buy. Jasim says that “where bakeries work, many women beg and ask those who have money to buy some bread for their children. Most of my neighbours eat bread only; they live on bread and water.” Even water can be difficult to obtain because the only source is neighbourhood wells from which it is pumped. But those who get water here need to provide petrol, which costs the Iraqi dinar equivalent of $15 a litre, to run the pump.Surprisingly, there is a limited supply of electricity, though not in all areas according to Jasim. He says that “we have electricity for about two hours every three days, though in some areas they haven’t had electricity since last month. People move during the day into other neighbourhoods to charge their phones.” The mobile network is available only at night time because it is then that there is electricity in the eastern government-held part Mosul where there are mobile phone towers mounted on trucks.The Isis-held enclave in Mosul, centred on the impenetrable warren of street and alleys so narrow that two people cannot walk abreast, is being heavily bombarded and is very dangerous. But people are still dying even in districts in east Mosul where fighting is supposed to have ended. An example of this happened on Monday in the east of the city in Nabi Yunus covered market, which is full of tiny booths and small shops, and which was crowded with shoppers when it was hit by the first of three Isis mortar bombs at 10 am. It struck a shop selling perfumes, which burst into flames, killing eleven adults and a child who were caught by the blast or burned to death by the fire which followed. Two more mortar bombs fired by Isis from the other side of the Tigris fell in the same area over the next hour, killing another child and two adults.A small crowd was looking at the blackened burned out little shops when we arrived as a soldier in a red cap and a policeman tried with limited success to disperse them. “Go home and don’t stand here because Daesh (Isis) might send a suicide bomber!” shouted the soldier angrily and some in the crowd looked worried, recalling that this is a favourite Isis tactic, and quickly walked away. The policemen said that many of the injured had been badly burned by the blazing perfume shop and were unlikely to survive.The mortar attack on Nabi Yunus market is only one incident out of dozens that are killing people every day in Mosul. There are at least 300,000 people packed into houses in the Old City of Mosul, which is still held by Isis and where it is impossible to distinguish fighters from civilians since they occupy the same houses which are often ancient and of flimsy construction. “Some of these houses are so old that they would fall if you raised your voice,” says Yohanna Towaya, a Christian leader who owns a house in the city.Controversy continues to rage over the death of as many as 240 civilians, many hiding in cellars, killed during an air strike by the US-led air coalition on the Jadida district on 17 March which reduced three buildings to heaps of rubble. The coalition says it did carry out air strikes called in by Iraqi ground forces on this area at that time, but the Iraqi Defence Ministry claims that only 61 civilians were killed and these died because Isis had booby trapped the walls of the buildings in which they had taken shelter. Since Saturday it has banned journalists from entering those parts of west Mosul that it holds, making it difficult to verify how many bodies have been taken from the rubble. The online news letter Shaafaq News, which first broke the story of the Jadida air strike, says that it has been told by a security source that the true figure for casualties in west Mosul since the start of the offensive is 3,864 dead and 22,759 injured.The best place from which to see what is happening in west Mosul is from the hill-top site once occupied by the Nabi Yunus shrine in east Mosul that was blown up by Isis as heretical in 2014. From there one can see the city on the western side of Tigris spread out like a map and, at first glance, the signs of war are not obvious aside from four plumes of smoke rising in the distance. Then there was the crash of Iraqi artillery firing nearby and, a few seconds later, another cloud of smoke rose in the distance. At one point, two helicopters passed over Isis-held territory and there was the sound of heavy machine gun or cannon fire.There are not many soldiers or police in east Mosul, most of the elite units that captured it having moved on to take part in the fighting on the far side of the Tigris. Traffic is heavy, many shops are open and occasionally one can see workers with heavy construction equipment filling craters or replacing sewage pipes that have been severed by bombs or shells. Even small bridges were destroyed by air strikes and there are frequent craters at cross roads.Ahmed, an architect who made a living in Mosul during the two-and-a-half year occupation by Isis by illegally selling cigarettes – for which he was repeatedly lashed – says that the main problem is the lack of electricity and fresh water aside from that pumped from wells. There are plenty of fruit and vegetables for sale on street stalls, but they are imported from Turkey and are expensive. Salaries for government employees, much the biggest source of employment all over Iraq, are only starting to be paid. Ahmed said that the behaviour of the Iraqi army at checkpoints “is 90 per cent better than it was before Daesh captured the city in 2014, but the failure of the Iraqi government to provide services or salaries for people is making them unpopular.”Ahmed fears that west Mosul will be totally destroyed, saying that “seven of my friends living in that part of the city have been killed this month alone – one by a Daesh sniper as he tried to escape and the six others by air strikes.” It may be that the siege of west Mosul still has a long way to go. Hoshyar Zebari, the former Iraqi Foreign and Finance Minister, says “west Mosul is not yet completely surrounded and Daesh are still sending in reinforcements, mostly from Central Asia”. Citing an Iraqi general with whom he had just been talking, he said that there had been no relaxation of the rules of the engagement for the conduct of US-led air strikes since Donald Trump became President, something confirmed by other sources. The bad news for Mosul is that the siege of any city, defended by well-trained fanatics who will not surrender and are intermingled with a large population, makes it tragically inevitable that the civilians will suffer heavy loss of life.








Leave Hillary aloneHillary Clinton made her first public appearance since last week’s concession speech yesterday at an event for the Children’s Defense Fund in DC. And she did it while rocking a mostly bare face.Her speech at the event eloquently explored her obvious disappointment at the election results, while remaining optimistic about the state of the country, stating that there’s still “common ground to build upon.”However, none of this seemed to matter to the internet. They were too busy being sidetracked by Hillary’s lack of makeup.What a surprise.Rather than listening to her words, the popular response was something we’re all too familiar with when we go bare faced.Tweeters claim she looks “sick” and she appears “tired” —  basically the same old stamina card that was continually trotted out by Trump supporters during the election.Why is it that everyone gives a fuck when we don’t spend at least half an hour in front of a mirror in the morning? All of a sudden we’re tired because we didn’t bother to brush on some mascara? Doesn’t anyone realize that the point of makeup is literally to make us not look tired? So obviously we look tired without it — especially if we’ve just spent the past year running for president.Why do we end up feeling uncomfortable just because we wanted an extra half an hour in bed?It’s either this, or we’re revolutionary. “Well done for having the balls for facing the world without foundation”, they say, “I can’t believe you have the confidence to leave the house with no make-up.” It’s not a big deal, it’s literally just how we look.To be fair, a lot of people expressed happiness with Clinton’s more minimal look. But that’s still not the point.When Alicia Keys showed up to the VMAs without make-up earlier this year, it was yet another instance of everyone losing their shit. She was applauded for it, great, but she later said she wasn’t trying to make a statement “for” or “against” makeup. She, like Hillary, is just trying to live her life.Every time a public figure goes makeup-free, the internet blows up and people are in shock. It’s sad and bizarre to think that people care so much about what a famous person does or does not wear on their face — especially when it seems to overshadow what they have to say.And what about normal girls? We’re increasingly self-conscious about wearing no makeup when this shit happens, but we shouldn’t be. We don’t need you to criticize or applaud us, just let us be.At the end of the day, Hillary clearly dgaf and neither do we.Source: http://thetab.com








It’s official! Ivanka Trump is joining the White House in an official government role! And you will never guess how much she will receive monthly!As a good example to follow from her father, Ivanka Trump will take an unpaid role as a government employee. Just like Ivanka and her father, Ivanka’s husband Jared Kushner already holds an unpaid government position.Her lawyer stated that she has a position to file financial disclosure forms required of employees.“We are pleased that Ivanka Trump has chosen to take this step in her unprecedented role as first daughter and in support of the president,” the White House said in a statement to NBC News. “Ivanka’s service as an unpaid employee furthers our commitment to ethics, transparency, and compliance and affords her increased opportunities to lead initiatives driving real policy benefits for the American public that would not have been available to her previously.”In a statement provided to CNBC, she said she “heard the concerns” about having an informal role and instead decided to serve in a position “subject to all of the same rules as other federal employees.”Ivanka Trump has already sat in on meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Whoa, this is simply GREAT act by our First Daughter! Just like her father! They are both amazing!What do you think about this? Please leave us your comment on Social Media! IF YOU THINK IVANKA TRUMP IS A PERFECT FIRST DAUGHTER, PLEASE LIKE AND SHARE!!!








Since the beginning, conservative businessman Donald J. Trump has been running an historic campaign, although he has never run for office. His poll numbers and overwhelming support are breaking records every day.Maybe even more surprisingly, he continues to do good in the polls.
But even Trump didn’t expect the amazing news he just received in his home state of New York. A critical state with many delegates up for grabs before the RNC convention in Cleveland, this new poll is a bombshell!
Via TheHill:
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has a whopping 43-point lead in New York, according to a new poll.
Trump has 60 percent support in the Empire State, according to a NY1/Baruch College survey released late Monday.John Kasich follows with 17 percent, with Ted Cruz at 14 percent.“Trump is just killing it,” said Baruch College pollster Mickey Blum. “This could really be his road to getting enough to win it outright before he ever gets to that [Republican National] Convention.”









                Posted By admin  on  January 6, 2017             As we all know the key to our country’s economy is the Federal Reserve Bank. For years the GOP has been trying to get the Fed to not be as secretive as they are and so shady.Senator Rand Paul has been trying to get a bill passed that will allow Congress access to see exactly how it is that the Federal Reserve operates so that way we know they are operating for the best interest of the people.This bill is known as “Audit the Fed” and would prevent the Federal Reserve from keeping information away from Congress. The best news is, President-Elect Donald Trump just threw his put his support out for this bill.FollowPresident-elect @realDonaldTrump has stated his support for #AuditTheFed. Let’s send him the bill this Congress. https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/press/sen-rand-paul-reintroduces-audit-the-fed …From Rand Paul’s Press Release:“NO INSTITUTION HOLDS MORE POWER OVER THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND THE VALUE OF OUR SAVINGS THAN THE FEDERAL RESERVE,” SAID SEN. PAUL, “YET FED CHAIR YELLEN REFUSES TO BE FULLY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE’S REPRESENTATIVES.” “THE U.S. HOUSE HAS RESPONDED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY PASSING AUDIT THE FED MULTIPLE TIMES, AND PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HAS STATED HIS SUPPORT FOR AN AUDIT. LET’S SEND HIM THE BILL THIS CONGRESS.” “THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DESERVES MORE INSIGHT INTO THE PRACTICES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE,” SAID REP. MASSIE. “BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, THE FED CRAFTS MONETARY POLICY THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DEVALUE OUR CURRENCY, SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND MAKE LIFE HARDER FOR THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS. IT IS TIME TO FORCE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO OPERATE BY THE SAME STANDARDS OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE TAXPAYERS THAT WE SHOULD DEMAND OF ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.” On January 12, 2016, a bipartisan Senate majority voted 53-44 in support of Audit the Fed. **This is HUGE! This just shows that Donald Trump can & will work with Congress on the issues that matter the most to the American people!So let’s show all the whiny liberals who said Trump could never work with Congress that in fact he IS & WILL! Let’s do that by sharing this out to everyone & leave a comment saying, “Donald Trump will Heal our Nation!”

Following the GOP’s failure to pass their Obamacare replacement, Pres.

Enter The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah. Noah eviscerated pretty much everyone involved: Paul Ryan for not realizing earlier that “doing big things is hard”; Pirro for sounding like “North Korean propaganda” and “like a mom who’s blaming other kids for something stupid her son did willingly”; and Trump for, well, being Trump. SourceThis week, California representative Maxine Waters claimed that black Americans who hate President Trump are actually more patriotic than his supporte…

HuffPost Pollster, which averages hundreds of national polls, has shown Sanders beating Trump by more than 10 percentage points since March. They currently show him defeating Trump by about 50% to 39%. Democrat Hillary Clinton, by contrast, beats Trump by about only four percentage points now; she has never enjoyed Sanders’ consistently wide lead.But hey, what does the synthesis of data from hundreds of sources over a significant stretch of time tell us? For McManus, apparently, not much.To the editor: I think this hellishly long season of political punditry has finally jumped the shark with the following sentence from the usually insightful McManus: “There’s one big reason Trump is doing better than expected in the polls: Republican voters have rallied behind him faster than some analysts expected.”So if I understand this correctly, Trump is defying expectations by doing better than expected? Source is here comments








 HILARIOUS!!Hollywood actor and liberal freak Shia LaBeouf just got trolled by Trump supporters who outsmarted him in the best possible way.In November after Trump won the election, intolerant snowflakes across America started to show their true colors and in the case of Shia LaBeouf, things got pretty ugly.“Tolerant” Hollywood liberal actor Shia LaBeouf was caught on camera screaming over and over again in a young Trump supporters face: “He Will Not Divide Us!”…WARNING: It’s pretty hard to watch the insanely angry actor screaming in this innocent looking young boy’s face. The young boy stands his ground and appears to be trying to ignore him, which doesn’t stop Labeouf from bullying him.LaBeouf set up a camera outside of the Museum of the Moving Image in NYC, inviting other Trump haters to join him as they shout down Trump supporters. Eventually Labeouf was forced to move his idiotic display. But that didn’t stop him or his ignorant shenanigans showing just how intolerant liberal actors really are. Unfortunately for Labeouf, he was no match for Trump supporters who pulled the ultimate “capture the flag” on him…Shia LaBeouf moved his anti-Trump protest to an “undisclosed location” – and trolls accepted the challenge https://t.co/pwTj7U0ahP pic.twitter.com/ABHeZBB3fs— New York Post (@nypost) March 10, 2017Shia LaBeouf moves his flag to an undisclosed location.

DURHAM, N.C. ― North Carolina has been in an almost constant state of protest for the last year.   It started in March 2016, when former Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed HB 2, a measure preventing local governments from passing anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people, into law. Thousands of protesters responded by storming the state Capitol. In late September, six consecutive nights of protest rocked Charlotte after a police officer fatally shot 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott. In October, the state chapter of the NAACP sued several counties over an alleged voter suppression attempt. Protesters again swarmed the capital, Raleigh, in December to stand against GOP-backed measures to limit the powers of the newly elected Gov. Roy Cooper (D). Now many activists are coalescing around another shared concern: President Donald Trump. Progressives see North Carolina as a breeding ground of possibility, as recent liberal activism has begun to show what’s possible when organizers take aim at a common threat. This is especially true in the Triangle area of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, where more than 20 colleges and universities house plenty of aggravated liberals. Liberal Tar Heels want to use their energy to turn the state solidly blue by 2020, when a number of key political offices will be up for grabs. Avid Trump supporter Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who has been very critical of the current wave of protests, will be up for re-election in 2020. So will Cooper. And Democrats are aiming to take control of the state legislature ― Republicans currently hold 74 state House seats, compared to Democrats’ 46, and 35 state Senate seats, compared to Democrats’ 15.Although these activists will have to contend with the state’s racial gerrymandering ― the general assembly drew new district lines in 2014 and 2016 that put a high number of voters of color into certain districts in order to dilute their voting power ― North Carolina’s status as a purple state makes progressives optimistic. Many people assume North Carolina is a Republican state, but the state Senate was under Democratic control from 1992 to 2011. Democrats also controlled the state House from 1992 to 1994, and again from 1999 to 2010. Only three Republican governors have led the state in the last 50 years, and North Carolina went blue for former President Barack Obama in 2008. But that was the first time since 1976 that the state had voted for a Democratic presidential nominee, and it went for Republicans Mitt Romney in 2012 and Trump in 2016. Last year’s election was very close, however: Trump beat Hillary Clinton by just 3.6 percent. Activists say they hope flipping North Carolina can cause a ripple effect across the 14 states that constitute the South. Republicans below the Mason-Dixon Line currently control 24 Senate seats, 110 House seats and 180 Electoral College votes (167 of which went to Trump in November). “If you fundamentally shift any of those states ― and they begin to vote in more progressive ways ― then you fundamentally change the American democracy and the landscape,” Rev. William Barber, the president of North Carolina’s NAACP, told reporters last year.

North Carolina has a strong, influential history of political protest. On Feb. 1, 1960, four black students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University refused to move from a lunch counter in downtown Greensboro after being denied service. By Feb. 5, the Greensboro sit-ins had grown to include approximately 300 students. Extensive television media coverage of the sit-ins helped the anti-segregation movement circulate through southern and northern college towns; students began peacefully protesting segregated libraries, beaches, hotels and other businesses. By the end of March, protests were underway in at least 55 cities in 13 states. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a youth organization that played an integral role in the civil rights movement, was founded a month later at Shaw University.  Real policy change followed: Eateries throughout the South began integrating by the end of that summer. That fight was similar to the current battle against Trump, said Marcus Bass, an organizing member of Charlotte-based activist group The Tribe. “North Carolina’s civil rights history has been embedded in this political fight ― so much so that it makes sense for us to have a lot of this mobility around organizing,” he said.In addition to fighting police violence, which has garnered a significant amount of media attention, black activities have been deeply involved in advocating for LGBTQ, immigrant and women’s rights in North Carolina. They are also key figures in the Moral Mondays protests, a movement launched in April 2013 to object against Republican legislative policies. Moral Monday protesters began meeting every Monday at the state Capitol to protest the actions McCrory and the Republican legislature had taken against voting and abortion rights, the environment and racial justice. Like the Greensboro sit-ins, the movement ignited activists in other states, including Georgia, South Carolina, New Mexico, Illinois and Massachusetts.  “It’s provided a catalyst on a state level and on a local level for folks to begin to get engaged,” Bass said of Moral Mondays.  An estimated 80,000 people participated in the 11th annual Forward Together Moral March on Feb. 11, which Barber led. This year’s march focused on the duty of participants to stand against the Trump administration and its policies ― such as repealing the Affordable Care Act ― as well as race-based gerrymandering and HB 2. “We march not as a spontaneous action but as a movement that stands upon deep foundations of organizing that have gone on for years, setting the groundwork for times such as this,” Barber said to the crowd at the march. “Four years later we realize we have been preparing all along for such a time as this.” Moral Mondays also laid the groundwork for other protests ― nearly 17,000 people participated in Raleigh’s Women’s March the day after Trump’s inauguration. And more than 1,500 protesters flooded the state’s airports after Trump issued the first version of his executive order banning immigrants from a group of predominantly Muslim countries on Jan. 27.There was a strong protest movement in North Carolina before Trump, but his candidacy and election also worked to galvanize new activists. His election inspired Kelly Garvy, a 29-year-old employee at Duke Innovation & Entrepreneurship, to start the activist group Protecting Progress in Durham. Most of the group’s members weren’t involved in politics prior to the election. “Many people feel a moral duty to get more involved,” Garvy said. “Trump has scared a lot of people.” Christopher Butler, 36, started out phone banking for the N.C. Democratic Party last fall and housing people who were working for Clinton’s campaign ― something he said he never would have done before Trump. Catherine Caprio, 50, became chair of Durham’s 25th Precinct after volunteering on Clinton’s campaign and registering voters in rural parts of the county. Cherry Foreman, a 42-year-old Democrat, said she started going door to door and helping people register to vote last fall.These activists ― new and seasoned alike ― are laying groundwork they say can help elect more Democrats in 2018 and 2020. Mandy Carter, a 69-year-old activist involved in several local and national organizations, is identifying rallying causes, such as education, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and the environment. She’s also paying attention to demographic changes and watching individual precincts for opportunities to elect progressives. “All politics is local,” she said. “On Nov. 9, when I woke up that morning, besides being traumatized, nothing changed for me. My city council and my county commissioners have more control of my day-to-day life than what happens in D.C.” Alyssa Canty, the HBCU outreach coordinator for Common Cause NC, is working to institutionalize voting at North Carolina’s historically black colleges and universities and increase turnout among millennial voters, while also supporting and raising money for black candidates. Protecting Progress in Durham is focusing its efforts on rectifying voting laws that disproportionately hurt black voters, like vague voter registration forms and limited early voting opportunities, and getting the state’s gerrymandered district lines redrawn more fairly. The group is also working to boost grassroots organizing in rural areas in order to win back the nine counties that voted for Obama in 2008 but went to Trump in November. “North Carolina goes blue, it changes the game in a lot of different ways,” Garvy said. “The work that we’re doing here can’t be understated.”If you're always angry about politics, sign up for bruh., a sporadic newsletter by Julia Craven.powered by TinyLetterDo you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?

			The American people want to know what Hillary Clinton’s role was in the PizzaGate scandal that broke last year. Of course, the mainstream media has done its best to sweep this case under the rug, but concerned citizens are still pushing for answers.

Though what makes these allegations of pedophilia even more concerning is how long it has been happening. Old news reports have emerged that point to Hillary Clinton knowing about it and not doing anything to stop it.

Flashback to June 11th, 2013 when NBC was still reporting real news. Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie of the “Today” show actually did an investigative report on a government pedophile ring. In this broadcast, the two anchors provide internal memo’s that show Hillary Clinton shutting down an investigation into this perverted 		
			Trey Gowdy
Many people who pretend to be unbiased have knocked determined Congressman Trey Gowdy for his continued, unrelenting investigation into Hillary Clinton’s Benghazi crimes.

Trey Gowdy, thankfully, has the fortitude to tune those naysayers out and to continue holding Hillary accountable. It’s good he didn’t listen to them, because it turns out they weren’t unbiased at all.

These people were all just actors in the plan Hillary Clinton and her cronies hatched behind closed doors to try to intimidate Gowdy and destroy him politically.

This all came to light in emails between Hillary and her inner circle that were leaked. Hillary’s personal crime accomplice and lawyer David Kendall wrote a damning email explaining a ‘Possible pivot for HRC to go to political lynch party.”

		
			It has just been revealed exactly how deep Obama’s control of the “Russian” election story REALLY went. Trust me, this is gonna prove how right President Trump is!

According to Newsweek, James Comey presented documents to Obama about Russia hacking Hillary Clinton very early.

Comey wanted them presented to the public immediately.

‘He had a draft of it or an outline,’ the source said. ‘He held up a piece of paper in a meeting and said, ‘I want to go forward, what do people think of this?’

Obama’s cronies said “NO WAY!”



Instead, they wanted to use this as a chance to connect ALL the intelligence agencies so they could all “conclude” the exact same thing.

After that, they slowly twisted the information about the Russians to accuse Donald Trump of the unthinkable…WORKING 		
			Attorney General Jeff Sessions had no choice but to take reports from a private lab seriously about the cause of death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia, who supposedly died of a heart attack while sleeping, wasn’t autopsied when he died because at the time no foul play was suspected.

On the request of his family, the coroner removed a pint of his blood, a vile of spinal fluid and a syringe full of ocular fluid in case the family needed genetic material or wanted to have it tested. After it was revealed several months ago that the Obama administration covered up a suspicious intruder at the home where Scalia was staying, the family decided to have the material tested.

A private lab found a chemical derivative of foxglove and a nationwide manhunt for a killer began. Sess		
			A huge new development in Washington, D.C. may be putting American security back on track. This is great news for American patriots everywhere, and we need to get behind it!


According to various sources, FBI Director James Comey might soon be replaced by the Trump Administration. Even better, Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC) is already being touted as Comey’s successor, via US Defense Watch.

For those unaware of Gowdy’s many accomplishments, suffice it to say that the South Carolina conservative has been one of the more vocal critics of the Obama Administration for quite some time now.

In 2012, Gowdy was selected as the chairman of the House Select Committee tasked with investigating the failure at Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The committee’s final report offered a damning in		
			Oh how the Liberal Media Elite have fallen! They were so confident that they could continue to BRAINWASH the masses. They were even sure they would get to REALLY go after Trump and his buddies during the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.
SO WRONG!
First President Donald Trump himself announced that HE would be skipping the dinner. The Press really hated that. However, they were still hoping to attack Kellyanne Conway, Sean Spicer, James Mattis, and the rest of the crew.

NOT GONNA HAPPEN! Today Trump’s ENTIRE White House proved where their loyalties lie with an announcement that shook the media to its core…
THE ENTIRE WHITE HOUSE IS BOYCOTTING THE DINNER!
Awe. All the liberal “journalists” won’t have anyone to peddle their LIES and DECEPTIONS to. SAD!

The emails also reveal that Hillary Clinton is demanding a full military funeral, involving a motorcade through Washington D.C. as part of a massive State-funded celebration of her life.

The previously unseen emails between Clinton, Abedin and other colleagues were published by Judicial Watch as part of a cache of 1,184 pages of State Department records obtained by the conservative watchdog.

In one notable email exchange, Capricia Marshall, ambassador and long-time friend to Hillary Clinton, sought to map out her – and Bill Clinton’s – funerals because “planning is best done when they are still		
			For some bizarre reason, liberals seem staunchly opposed to recognizing the true threat that migrants pose to our country. They argue that being cautious is un-American, but all we have to do to see what is at stake is look to other Western countries. Fortunately,

President Donald Trump is not afraid to call things like they are.

According to Breitbart, Trump has just outlined a new “extreme vetting” system that would require new immigrants from Muslim- dominated countries to pledge that they have no desire to enact Sharia Law in the United States.

“In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test,” Trump said of the measure. “The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme, extreme vetting. Our country has enough problems.		
			The corruption in our government is astounding and the more you dig into the corruption the more you find. Which is exactly why Donald Trump won the election for all those brain dead liberals there reading this. The American people are sick and tired of being lied to and want to take back the country from these lying despots. For example, over the past two decades an astounding $10 trillion yes, I said trillion, has gone missing and no one knows where it went.

Since 1996, federal agencies must be audited just like the American people are. Well, apparently, the Pentagon has decided to exempt themselves for the last 20 years. Now, I have an issue with this considering that it is the taxpayer’s money missing.

And you haven’t heard about it, because it contains information about “secrets” the Obama administration had asked the Russian government to keep private, and the liberal mainstream media conveniently kept quiet about it.  See her bombshell of a statement for yourself (and – SPOILER ALERT! – pay extra attention to the second to last paragraph):

You can add Richard Hamilton’s name to the growing list of former NBA All-Stars who are contemplating cashing in on the massive contracts that have been handed out this summer.While talking to CBS Sports, the three-time All-Star shooting guard said he wants his agent to gauge NBA teams’ interest in the 38-year-old.“I’m giving myself 30 days where I am really hitting the gym.” Hamilton said. “I’m working on my game. I’m in the weight room. I’m running my two, three miles a day. And I’m trying to see if my body can hold up. If my body can hold up after these 30 days, I will be making a comeback.”Hamilton hasn’t played since 2013, finishing his career with the Bulls. He became a star with the Detroit Pistons, helping them win the title in 2004. He averaged 17.1 points, 3.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists during his 14-year career.Hamilton was great off the ball on offense, navigating through screens to find space for mid-range jumpers. He also showed an ability to hit from beyond the arc, shooting 35 percent from deep for his career.“If I get the opportunity where I can come in and earn my minutes,” Hamilton said. “I think that I will be able to make an impact on someone’s NBA team.” -Source-Richard Hamilton is the latest former NBA All-Star trying to make a comeback.

A 47-year-old hairdresser in Norway could face up to six months in prison for refusing to serve a Muslim client wearing a hijab in the country’s first case to go to court over the Islamic headdress.The business has no imperative to accommodate any Islamic. The fact that this Muslim would have the hubris to make a demand like this shows the intent of these invaders to disrupt western life. They need to be ushered out our western cultureIn accordance with Shariah law, she needed to have no men present to undo her hijab and uncover her hair to be styled. So she demanded Hodne remove all men from the premises.Hodne, a stylist for both men and women, couldn’t comply without discriminating. Her response, however, was a little over the top.According to the Express, she literally said she didn’t “want this evil inside the doors where I’m in charge,” which was discrimination, according to local authorities.“I fear the totalitarian symbol of the hijab which says that I should be killed, and for me, it is quite unnatural to provide good service in my situation. As most people know hijab-clad women do not get to show their hair to men. My salon is a men and women’s hair salon,” she said.“It would have been deeply discriminatory if I had banished men from the lounge because of a woman who could not show her hair to them,” she said. She has already been fined for discrimination, but she wasn’t budging.Evil is Islam’s ideology, Mohammedanism, and the hijab is symbols of this ideology, like the swastika is for Nazis. I’m not afraid to lose that I won’t pay for something that is wrong,” she said. “I’ll appeal to the court of human rights. I have dedicated my life to this. I’m not a racist. I am a political activist fighting against Mohammedanism of Europe. It’s not Muslims I’m critical of.”“If hijab is welcome in all other haircutting salons in the country, it shouldn’t be a problem if they are not welcome in my business. I have plenty of experience and can do my job, but there are many other hairdressers who also can,” she said.Whatever happen to “the right to refuse service at owners digression” Without being bashed or called racist?good for the hairstylistPeace be still! If any decent Muslim woman take issue with going in to a hair salon with men it say that she is a plant or and agitator  or being paid to make the new by agent prevaricators ,to give Islam a bad name. The Muslim women who know there religion would never go in a place adorned with men to remove her hijab, my advice to Muslim women the world over is open your own beauty salon for Muslim women only then it will be the other way around,then the men will be the invaders.This is BULL5HIT. This muslim knew what she was doing. Go to someone that would  accommodate you. Go somewhere that has ALL WOMEN. This should be thrown out.The stylist should have played along and chopped it off in sections..lol

Former Clinton Secretary Betrays Hillary On Live TV, Explains Exactly Why The Democrat Party Is FailingFormer Clinton Secretary of Labor Robert Reich contradicted Hillary on Live TV and even said that this is the worst shape the Democratic party has been in since the 1920’s. Hillary however, released an awkward video this week praising the Democratic party and saying that protesting is the party’s great strength.In Hillary’s latest speech she said “we as Democrats must move forward with courage, confidence, and optimism, and stay focused on the elections we must win this year and next. Let resistance plus persistence equal progress for our party and our country.” However Reich had a very different message.“Right now, there is a disconnect, George, between a rather sclerotic Democratic apparatus which is in complete disarray. I mean the Democratic Party has not been in this bad shape since the 1920’s and a huge uprising at the grassroots, mostly against Trump,” said Reich.“How can Tom Perez, can he actually utilize that, turn the Democratic Party from a vast fund-raising machine into a movement? Hasn’t been done before very easily,” said Reich.“You remember in the Vietnam war days, we had a huge uprising. But the Democratic Party had nothing to do with that. The thing that worries me most of all, if you look at the problems inside the Democratic Party, they have a lot to do with the same sort of populist uprising we’re seeing across the country, including the Donald Trump campaign,” said Reich. Do you think Hillary is pissed?

The Herbivorous Butcher locks down the win for USA Today’s Best Food & Drink Makers award.USA Today crowned Minneapolis-based vegan butcher shop The Herbivorous Butcher the winner of its nationwide contest to determine America’s best food and drink makers. The vegan butcher shop was up against nine other finalists, including upcycled spirit decanters Reclamation Etchworks and candy-makers Sparkling Sweets Boutique—who took second and third place, respectively. Initial nominations were made by USA Today’s editorial staff plus a panel of experts, before voting was opened to readers in September. The Herbivorous Butcher—founded by brother-and-sister team Kale and Aubry Walch—gained popularity as the first all-vegan butcher shop to open in the United States, and continues to innovate their plant-based meat and cheese creations to attract customers across the country. “Winning is perhaps less a testament to our popularity but more to the love and support of the vegan community,” Kale told VegNews. “The vegan movement has obviously grown, and people are bringing their passion and compassion into all aspects of their lives.” The Herbivorous Butcher’s Kale and Aubry Walch are winners of the 2016 VegNews Veggie Awards in the category of Media Darlings.  source:http://vegnews.com/Great article








Senate Confirmation Hearings of Donald Trump’s Cabinet Picks – James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, Mike Pompeoby Paul Craig RobertsReuters reports that 2,700 US troops accompanied by tanks are moving across Poland toward the Russian border. Col. Christopher Norrie, commander of the 3rd Armoured Brigade Combat Team, declared: “The main goal of our mission is deterrence and prevention of threats.”U.S. troops arrive to Poland as part of NATO deployment.Apparently, the colonel is not sufficiently bright to realize that far from preventing threats, the force he is leading presents as a threat. And to no less a military power than Russia.What is the point of this miniscule force? It woud not constitute a threat to Russia if it were 100 times larger, perhaps even one thousand times larger. Remember, Hitler invaded Russia against an unprepared Stalin with the largest and best military force the world had ever seen in the largest military operation in human history. The German invasion force was comprised of 3,800,000 troops, 600,000 motorized vehicles, 3,350 tanks, 7,200 artillery pieces, and 2,770 aircraft. The Red Army, despite its officer corps having been purged by Stalin, ate up this magnificient force and won the war against Germany.Compared to Stalin’s Russia, Putin’s Russia is prepared. NATO is not capable of assemblying a large enough force to invade Russia. So what is the point of the 2,700 US troops moving across Poland toward Russia?The answer is to keep alive the Western propaganda that Russia is a threat and to make it as difficult as possible for Trump to normalize relations with Russia. It is extraordinary that the US military is conducting this provocative exercise that contradicts the policy of the incoming president.The US military, the CIA, and their whores in the US media are undemocratically pursuing their own agenda independent of the policy of the president-elect. According to the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, US intelligence officials have even warned the Israeli government not to share intelligence information with the Trump administration, because Putin has “leverages of pressure” over Trump and Trump will leak the information to Russia and Iran. http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.764711President-Elect Trump’s First Press ConferenceWe can see how the military/security complex’s sabotage of Trump’s policy works. Constant accusations have forced Trump to say that possibly the Russians were involved in a hacking that never occured, neither by Russia nor anyone else.Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State, Tillerson, has to declare Russia to be a threat in his confirmation hearing in order to be confirmed.Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, Mattis, has had to say in his confirmation hearing that the US needs to be prepared to confront Russia militarily, adding that there are few areas in which the US can cooperate with Russia which he says is trying to break NATO.​We could dismiss Trump’s admission as throwing a bone to the CIA so they can feel vindicated and get off his back, and the statements by Tillerson and Mattis could be dismissed as what has to be said in order to be confirmed.Nevertheless, these statements from Trump’s top appointments are being used as confirmations that everyone except Trump, even Trump’s own government, realize that Russia is a threat.The propaganda picture of Russia that the Obama regime worked so hard to create now has the luster of acceptance by Trump’s nominees for State and Defense. Whether Tillerson and Mattis mean it or not, clearly the US Congress in thrall to the campaign donations from the military/security complex is determined that Russia be regarded as a threat.The Russians watching all this must quickly be losing their hopes for normalized relations. The US ruling establishment is causing hope to fade and suspicion to rise in the Russian government, thus raising barriers within Russia herself to Trump’s policy of better relations.Nothing speaks more clearly of the unbridled evil of the US Establishment than its willingness to risk conflict with Russia for the sake of its hold on power and profit.Where is the liberal-left’s moral conscience? Why is the liberal-left helping the military/security complex delegitimize Trump and box him in so that his agenda is dead on arrival and thermo-nuclear war remains an option?FaceBook Comments

The year 1393by  Uri Avnery,   …with Gush ShalomSteven Green found the motherloadEditor’s note: Uri has another historical retrospective for us on what might seem to be an old and well-beaten topic, “When and who really started the 1948 War?” This has been a debate-swamp to wade into, not only due to the competing ideologies but also key little details, such as disagreement over when one side first committed to military action to impose its will on the other.Uri gives a good review of the debate below, and I have only to add to it what the declassified US Intel showed — a topic Uri never touches because he has never had any interest in knowing, or did not like its conclusions.Steven Green blew the doors off the Zionist 1948-war spin story with his seminal “Taking Sides“, published in 1984, based on the new access to U.S. archives via the Freedom of Information Act. Green’s research turned up a treasure trove of formerly classified material to delve into.The book was so devastating that some in the Reagan White House were looking for a way to prosecute him, until the idiots were reminded that it would be hard, due to the government having provided the files. So what they did is “reclassify” some of the most damaging material — if you can wrap your mind around that.Here is the devastating conclusion, which to this day, few are aware has been public knowledge for over 30 years, and yet corporate media and academia have chosen to ignore it.In March 1948, a Joint Chiefs of Staff paper on ‟Force Requirements for Palestine,‶ anticipating the termination of the British Mandate, predicted that the ‟Zionist strategy will seek to involve [the United States] in a continuously widening and deepening series of operations intended to secure maximum Jewish objectives…The JCS paper added ominously: ‟All stages of this program are equally sacred to the fanatical concepts of Jewish leaders. The program is opening admitted by same leaders, and has been privately admitted to United States officials by responsible leaders of the presently dominant Jewish group…the Jewish Agency.”I have published this numerous times over the years and never had an inquiry from the Hebrew lobby looking for additional enlightenment. Green’s book was not a big seller, due to what appeared to be an organized campaign to ignore it. In those pre-Internet days, certain powers could strangle a book by not publishing any reviews in major media.As Gordon would say, “Welcome to how the world really works”… Jim W. Dean ]Israeli Avia S-199 vs Egyptian Spitfire over Israel 1948-49Last week I tried to describe the 1948 war, starting from the shooting at a Jewish bus on the morrow of the UN partition resolution. Some readers dispute the timing. They insist that the war started on May 15, on the morrow of the founding of the State of Israel, when the armies of the neighboring Arab states entered the country.I have seen this many times. Every serious debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict raises the question: “When did it start?” Each side has its own date, proving that the other side started it.The Arabs started it, the Zionists assert. The conflict started with the “invasion” of the Arab armies. (“Invasion” in quotation marks, since they entered the territories allotted by the UN to the Palestinian Arab state, though their declared aim was to crush the new Jewish state right at the beginning.)The Jews started it, the Arabs assert. They began to drive the Arab population out, leading to the Naqba (“disaster”). The Arabs started it, reply the Zionists. Why did we have to evict the Arab population? It was because you shot at our villages after the UN resolution of November 29, 1947.The Jews started it, retort the Arabs. It all started with that atrocious resolution. The UN, consisting at the time mainly of Western and Communist states, gave a country that did not belong to them to the Jews, who did not belong to it.Yes, say the Jews, but it really started with the White Paper issued by the British in May, 1939, which in effect closed the doors of Palestine to the Jews just when the Nazis were planning the Holocaust.We had no choice, interject the British. In 1936, the Arabs started a revolt in which Jews and our soldiers were killed all over the country.But why did we have to do so? cry out the Arabs. Because masses of German Jews were coming to Palestine after 1933, when Adolf Hitler assumed power in Germany. We had to stop it, even by violent means, to prevent Palestine from turning into a Jewish country.Really, retort the Jews, but you started it long before, in 1929, when you organized riots all over the country, killing lots of Jews. We had no choice, assert the Arabs. The British government of Palestine favored the Zionists and allowed them to settle all over.That was our right, say the Jews, enshrined in the Mandate conferred by the League of Nations on the British.Who gave the League of Nations the right to confer a Mandate on anybody? ask the Arabs. The land belonged to its inhabitants, almost all of whom were Arabs. That’s how it all started.But the Arabs attacked the Jews in 1919, showing how much the British were needed.The British had no business being here, answer the Arabs. The whole mess really started in 1917 when the British published the Balfour Declaration, promising to establish a Jewish “national home” in Palestine, which belonged, at the time, to the (Muslim) Ottoman Empire.The Ottoman Empire was dying, say the Jews, and the Zionist movement, which was founded in 1896, had already proclaimed its right to Palestine.But at the same time the modern Arab national movement was born, which had an indisputable claim to Palestine and all the Arab countries.God has promised… Allah has ordained… And so on.I have my own theory about when and how the conflict started. In 1904 Theodor Herzl, the founding father of the Zionist movement, died. Herzl did not like Palestine very much, and started his ideological quest with the idea of founding a Jewish state in Patagonia, an Argentine territory which had recently been “pacified”.Herzl did not like the Turks or the Arabs, but events convinced him that the Jews would go nowhere but Palestine. In his book “Der Judenstaat”, the Bible of Zionism, he declared that the Jews would serve in Palestine as an outpost of Western civilization against the barbarians of Asia – i.e. the Arabs.One can argue that it was here that the conflict really started – right at the beginning of the Zionist idea. But I have in mind an even more precise moment.A few years before World War I, the Ottoman Empire showed signs of breaking up. A modernizing movement, led by army officers, assumed power in 1908. They called themselves “the Young Turks”.Among the restless Arab population, too, revolutionary groups emerged. Ruhi Al-Khalidi (1861-1913)They dared not yet talk about independence, but instead put forward a plan for the “de-centralization” of the Ottoman Empire, giving its various nations some autonomy.A group of Arab members of the Turkish parliament, led by Rukhi al-Halidi (member of a Jerusalem family even now prominent in Palestinian affairs) had a brilliant idea: why not approach the Zionists and offer them an alliance against the Turks in the fight for this idea?The Zionist representative in Jerusalem hastened to submit this offer to Max Nordau, the new president of the Zionist organization. Nordau had inherited Herzl’s post after the death of the founder. This was a historic moment, one of those moments when history holds its breath. A totally new vista opened up: an alliance between Arabs and Jews! a joint liberation movement!Nordau, a famous German-Jewish intellectual, did not dream of accepting this offer. He must have considered it crazy. The Turks were the masters of the country. They could give Palestine to the Jews. They could be bribed. The Arabs were powerless. They could give us nothing.So the moment passed. Nordau mentioned the idea to the Zionist Congress in Hamburg, but nobody took any notice.Max NordauFew people know about this episode. It is described in the authoritative book by the late Aharon (“Aharonchik”) Cohen.The possibility existed only in theory. History is made by real people, whose consciousness is formed by the realities of their time. For Europeans of the early 20th century, the idea of such an alliance with the natives against an imperial power was close to lunatic.In retrospect, this idea could have changed history. We would have been born into a different world.In the autumn of 1947, when I was just 24 years old, I published a booklet called (in Hebrew) “War or Peace in the Semitic Region”. It was an almost exact repetition of the ideas in the Nordau incident – which I knew nothing about at the time.It opened with the words: “When our fathers, the Zionists, decided to set up a ‘safe haven’ in this country, they had the choice between two paths:“They could appear in West Asia as a European conqueror, who sees himself as the bridgehead of the ‘white’ race, a master of the ‘natives’, like the Spanish conquistadores and the Anglo-Saxon colonists in America. This is what the Crusaders at their time did in this country.“The other path was to see themselves as an Asiatic people returning to its homeland – who sees himself as an heir of the political and cultural tradition of the Semitic race, and is ready to lead the people of the Semitic Region in the war of liberation against European exploitation.”With the exception of the terminology, which belonged to its time, I subscribe to every word even today, almost 70 years later.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict began when the first Jewish colonist came to this country in 1882, even before the official founding of the Zionist movement. It began as a clash between two great national movements, which were totally ignorant of each other. This ignorance persists, in large part, to this very day.The past cannot be changed. But perhaps, perhaps, we can learn from it and draw some conclusions.______________FaceBook CommentsJew; This area belongs to me

So it goes on and on. It is the worst story of our times, the only thing sure is Might is Right ! The silver lining is that the signs of the fall of western civilization are clearly visible like all other civilizations before them and hopefully justice will be done at some time in near future.++A much better story than Uri Avery version is by this Rabbi who tells it all::::::Rothschild killed Hertzel cuz Hertzel didn’t want  move RKM to Palestine:::::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELwmUVc7ReAUri continues to con us dumb goyim as usual, by shilling/apologising away the truth. A little bit like 911 Sabrosky telling us it was israel/pentagon whilst continuing to be employed at the War College.Why did it work peacefully nearly 1900 years until this Zionist Congress in Basel decided in 1898 to claim Palestine as their homeland ? The crux is this Zionists movement created by Theodor Herzl on their fake bible claim. Since the beginning until the King James version it was changed 14800 time so don´t tell me it is the true word of god.http://judentum-projekt.de/persoenlichkeiten/geschichte/herzl/index.htmlIt all started with when god said “let us create men in our image” and it goes along when Adam and Eve were created LOLAnd my usual mourning “if they only were real Joos”Ed… well written.  One thing  Western Historians the Arabs point of view. Maybe because the West is scared to offend Jewish money power. In 1948, the Egyptian Army was closing on Tel Aviv. Under pressure from the British Occupation, King Farouq ordered the Egyptian army to withdraw. This was the main reason Farouq lost the support of the Egyptians. Also the British became so hated for betraying the Egyptian Army in Palestine after the Egyptian artillery had helped stop Rommel’s advance on the Suez canal.Excellent article. This should be required reading in High Schools, Colleges, and blasted across the front pages of supposed “News Outlets”. Not to mention all the armchair “Generals” and Pastors out there who could glean a little knowledge before spouting off about “fulfilling Biblical Prophecy”.Somebody help me out here.  Where’d that map come from, and what is that “Latin Empire of the Polish Nation” area there on the Black Sea coast of what is modern Turkey?I think this issue is the date of the map 1393, not a map period most of us are familiar with.If you Google IMAGES:::::::: 1393 middle east mapThat map also pops up!!!!!http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u241/RGBparadox/1393Turk.png@LC

CHAPPiE is a movie about a police robot with advanced artificial intelligence who gets kidnapped by gangsters. However, the true story of the movie is told through allegory and symbols: CHAPPiE is about the abandonment of old religions for a new, futuristic, transhumanist religion.Warning: Massive spoilers ahead!CHAPPiE was created by Neill Blomkamp’s, the South African director who is also behind District 9 and Elysium. As in his two previous films, Blomkamp hides a deeper message beneath the guns, the robots and the gangsters, one that even goes in the spiritual realm.At first glance, the movie appears to be an odd mix of science fiction and Zef aesthetics (South African street culture championed by the rap duo Die Antwoord, who also star in the movie), but there is more than enough symbolism, mainly Biblical, to read a second level of interpretation. Indeed, the story of a sentient robot that becomes aware of its own “mortality” (its battery is dying out) evokes religious and existential questions in the real world where intelligent robots are just about to mix with humanity. However, the movie does not raise its questions or invite reflection. It simply proposes an answer. And that answer can apparently accomplish what religions have been promising since the dawn of time: Immortality. The answer CHAPPiE provides? Transhumanism.The concept of transhumanism has been mentioned often on this site because it is an important part of the mass media agenda. In a nutshell, transhumanism is about the merging of humans with robots in order to create “enhanced” humans. Along with the pragmatic, scientific side of transhumanism comes an entire philosophy and belief system, which mainly rejects the concepts that God’s creation is perfect and that humans should not play God.Max More, the father of transhumanism, eloquently described the spiritual thinking behind the movement in his 1990 essay “In Praise of the Devil”. Here’s an excerpt: (you can download the full original article here).“The Devil – Lucifer – is a force for good (where I define ‘good’ simply as that which I value, not wanting to imply any universal validity or necessity to the orientation). ‘Lucifer’ means ‘light-bringer’ and this should begin to clue us in to his symbolic importance. The story is that God threw Lucifer out of heaven because Lucifer had started to question God and was spreading dissension among the angels. We must remember that this story is told from the point of view of the Godists (if I may coin a term) and not from that of the Luciferians (I will use this term to distinguish us from the official Satanists with whom I have fundamental differences). The truth may just as easily be that Lucifer resigned from heaven.God, being the well-documented sadist that he is, no doubt wanted to keep Lucifer around so that he could punish him and try to get him back under his (God’s) power. Probably what really happened was that Lucifer came to hate God’s kingdom, his sadism, his demand for slavish conformity and obedience, his psychotic rage at any display of independent thinking and behaviour. Lucifer realised that he could never fully think for himself and could certainly not act on his independent thinking so long as he was under God’s control. Therefore he left Heaven, that terrible spiritual-State ruled by the cosmic sadist Jehovah, and was accompanied by some of the angels who had had enough courage to question God’s authority and his value-perspective. Lucifer is the embodiment of reason, of intelligence, of critical thought. He stands against the dogma of God and all other dogmas. He stands for the exploration of new ideas and new perspectives in the pursuit of truth.”
– Max More, In Praise of the Devil, Atheist Notes 003As you can see, More describes Lucifer as a force for good who gives humanity the tools to fight Jehova’s tyranny. This vision is perfectly in line with elite’s Luciferian doctrine as taught in occult secret societies.CHAPPiE provides a 101 of this mindset in terms that everybody, especially young people, can understand. Mostly, it sells an idea that is being promoted in all kinds of media, especially video game: A robot body is better than a human body.In the not-so-distant future of 2016, the crime-ridden city of Johannesburg has replaced its entire police force with intelligent robots programmed to fight crime. These robots are incredibly effective and boast one massive advantage over their human counterparts: They cannot die and they can be repaired easily.Deon Wilson, the creator of these police robots is widely praised for his invention. He however has a more important project in the works: A robot with artificial intelligence so advanced that it can learn by itself, have feelings and even write poems – named CHAPPiE.CHAPPiE is however “kidnapped” by a couple of gangsters who want to train it to commit crimes. Thus ensues a bunch of hilarious adventures that barely make sense. However, beyond the gun-toting action scenes are dialogs and symbols that tell a story with spiritual dimension. Before this happens, though, the movie makes sure you love that robot by making it as human as possible.Although it is not alive and not a human being, CHAPPiE is thoroughly humanized in the movie. Because his artificial intelligence needs to learn everything from scratch, CHAPPiE starts off with the charming innocence and ignorance of a child. Yolandi quickly becomes his “mommy” as she treats him like a child. At one point she says:“He’s so cute! He’s like a baby.”She even reads him bedtime stories.After reading a bedtime story, Yolandi tells CHAPPiE a bunch of things that do not apply to him … because he is a robot. She does not appear to see that.“It’s not so much how you look that’s special. It’s what’s inside. That’s what makes you different. See, it’s who you really are. Inside. Your soul.You see…The outside, this is just temporary. When you die, the soul inside goes to the … next place. The thing inside …that’s what mommy loves. Mommy loves you.”She then proceeds to hug the robot.Now that it is established that we all love the adorable baby robot, we see it go through some tough challenges. That’s a great way to make us love it even more.As CHAPPiE’s intelligence grows, it faces the same existential questions humans have been bogged with since the dawn of time. It is also exposed to two opposite philosophies.At first, CHAPPiE is mainly exposed to the one who created him, Deon. By constantly referring to himself as “his maker”, the movie strongly suggest that Deon is, to the robot, God  – who is also referred to as “the maker”.Knowing that CHAPPiE is surrounded by shady characters, Deon attempts to teach it moral values and to do the right thing.“CHAPPiE please have respect for me. I’m your maker. Listen to me, I’m your maker. I brought you into this world, okay? This is serious. You mustn’t engage in these people’s lifestyle choices. No counting narcotics, no robberies, no crimes.And you’ve got to promise me, your maker, that you’ll never do any of those things, all right? You can’t break a promise.”CHAPPiE’s mommy and daddy are however less bent on moral rectitude. Quite to the contrary, CHAPPiE’s daddy is eager to teaching him that the world is a cruel, savage place where only the strong survives.After witnessing a dog fight, Ninja tells CHAPPiE:-Out there … in the wild … it’s hard. You’re either that dog [points to the dog that is still alive] or that dog [points to the dead dog]. If you wanna survive, CHAPPiE … you must fight. What are you gonna do when that battery runs out?-I die? CHAPPiE die?-Deon, he put you in a broken body.-Deon’s my maker. It doesn’t make any sense. He wouldn’t just make me so I could die. Deon loves me, daddy.-I can get you a new body, but it takes lots of monies.In this short dialogue, we get an important chunk of transhumanist philosophy and its spiritual undercurrent. As an intelligent robot that has become aware of his mortality, CHAPPiE realizes that his maker has put him in a situation where death is unavoidable and that the only way to escape it (crimes) is forbiddn.While Deon, the maker, teaches moral values, Ninja appeals to the animalistic, materialistic side. He compares himself to a dog in a dog fight. On a spiritual standpoint, he is Satan opposing God.After fully engaging in Ninja’s gangster lifestyle, CHAPPiE encounters his maker again. Then ensues a dialog that can also be interpreted as a dialog between mankind and God himself.-Daddy told me about you, Deon. About how you made me in a body that will die. You are my maker. Why’d you make me so I could die?-I didn’t make you so you could die, CHAPPiE.-I want to live, I want to stay here with my mommy. I don’t want to die.-You’ve become so much more than I’ve could ever have imagined. How was I supposed to know that you would become … you?In this dialog, Deon says that he could not predict that CHAPPiE would turn into such an intelligent and self-aware robot. This is a reflection of transhumanist philosophy where it is believed that humanity has reached level of intelligence that surpasses the rest of creation and that God is unfairly limiting its potential by placing it in a physical world where it doomed to die. Believing that they can transcend this mortal state to become gods themselves, transhumans seek man-made technology to achieve nothing less than immortality – the ultimate goal of most religions (who generally refer to spiritual immortality).As CHAPPiE seeks to escape his body to escape inevitable death (his battery running out) Deon keeps telling him that it is impossible and that he should simply accept his fate. CHAPPiE is however convinced that he can acquire the knowledge necessary to reach his goal, effectively rejecting the warnings of his maker.-The problem is greater than your battery. Because you are conscious. You cannot be copied because you’re not data. We don’t know what consciousness is … we cannot move it.-CHAPPiE can figure it. I can know what it is, then I can move me.-You can’t move it, I’m sorry.-You said to me I mustn’t let anybody say that I cannot do something. Daddy says he can get me bodies for the moneys. I hate you … go away.This dialog represent transhumanist’s rejection of the belief that “playing god” is wrong. Transhumanists have complete faith in science and technology to achieve immortality.There is however one main obstacle to CHAPPiE’s quest: Vincent Moore, a jerk … who is also a Christian.Like Deon, Vincent Moore designs robots at the company Tetravaal. His robot is over awful.While it is not immediately obvious, the movie leaves enough clues to indicate that Moore is a staunch Christian. For instance, he tells Deon they should go to church together (after threatening him with a gun). Later, when he hears CHAPPiE talking about living forever, we see Moore doing the sign of the cross. He then proceeds to call CHAPPiE a “godless freak”. As CHAPPiE becomes increasingly self-aware, Vincent, turns into the “bad guy” of the movie and keeps messing with CHAPPiE and his maker.While Deon created intelligent, autonomous robot cops that are used by the Johanessburg police force, Vincent’s robot is a big, dumb, ineffective machine that cannot think for itself. In fact, it needs a human to tell it what to do. Is the Moose meant to represent Christians who cannot think for themselves?One thing is for sure, Vincent hates CHAPPiE and everything it represents. At one point, he kidnaps it and hurts it bad.Vincent tells CHAPPiE:“You know that simple AI program makes you think you’re real. You know what? You are not. Just a bunch of wires.”He’s right. But, since he’s the bad guy, viewers believe that he’s wrong. Also, as the bad guy, Vincent does a other awful things: He causes city-wide chaos by shutting down every single robot cop in the Johannesburg. He then uses his Moose robot to kill CHAPPiE’s mommy.CHAPPiE then gets very mad. He finds Vincent and beats the crap out of him.In the end, pretty much everybody around CHAPPiE gets badly hurt by the Moose. What’s the answer to save all these fragile humans? Turning them into robots, of course.After humanizing the robot to make him relatable and “adorable”, the movie then proceeds to robotize humans. Indeed, the people closest to CHAPPiE, his maker and his mommy, are facing death because they’ve been shot.Luckily for them, CHAPPiE discovered how to save a person’s entire consciousness on a single file and he discovered how to upload it to robot body. In short, he found a way to make humans and intelligent robots immortal. CHAPPiE is therefore the savior of humanity … and robots.Since CHAPPiE saved his mommy’s consciousness on a USB drive, he can also bring her back from the dead. She was therefore resurrected … like Jesus.After understanding the philosophical undercurrent of the movie, CHAPPiE becomes less of an entertainment product and more of an infomercial for transhumanism. Beneath the CGI and the actions scenes are arguments pleading for transhumanism as the only way to achieve human salvation.Since transhumanism is about the merging of humans with robots, the movie blurs the line between what makes a human human and what makes a robot a robot. First, CHAPPiE is thoroughly humanized –  he is shown growing from child-like innocence into humanity-saving genius. He also loves his mommy very much. The movie even brushes on questions such as: Are intelligent robots “real”? Do they have rights? And so forth.Then, after thoroughly displaying the fragility of the human body, the movie proceeds to depict the robotization of humans as the way to achieve immortality. As seen above, this robotization was achieved after a period of tribulation between CHAPPiE and his maker which can be interpreted as a period of tribulation between humanity and God. Indeed, through CHAPPiE’s rebellion against his maker to become immortal (and to become a maker himself), the movie describes transhumanism’s rebellion against religions that considers God’s creations as perfect and unalterable. For transhumanists, God left humans in an imperfect body to live in a dangerous physical world. And that needs to be corrected. As Max More stated:“No more gods, no more faith, no more timid holding back. Let us blast out of our old forms, our ignorance, our weakness, and our mortality. The future belongs to posthumanity.”
– Max More, On becoming posthuman.Although transhumanist rhetoric goes against religions, it nevertheless requires you to have blind faith in science and technology to salvage humanity and to achieve immortality. And CHAPPiE is one of its many holy books.








ELDER PATRIOT – Former Obama administration Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas made an explosive admission with broad implications to MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski. Farkas confirmed that President Obama ordered intensified “intelligence gathering” on incoming President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to Russia.In plain English, Farkas admitted they aggressively spied on Trump and members of his transition team:var RevContentSolo = { button_text: 'Find Out More', widget_id: 65676};
“I was urging my former colleagues, and, and frankly speaking to the people on the Hill [Democrat politicians], it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can – get as much intelligence as you can – before President Obama leaves the administration.“Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left; so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy, um, that the Trump folks – if they found out HOW we knew what we knew about their, the Trump staff, dealing with Russians – that they would try to compromise those sources and methods; meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence.“So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia; so then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were also trying to help get information to [Democrat politicians].”Wow!  Ms. Farkas just admitted that the Obama administration not only spied on Donald Trump and his transition team but that she worked with others to spread classified intelligence to Democrats on Capitol Hill!!!If Farkas’ claims prove to be true it’ll make Watergate look like child’s play in comparison.  It’s time for Chairman Devin Nunes of the House Select Committee on Intelligence to subpoena Mr. Farkas to testify under oath in public session so that Americans can know what she knows.Only then can Americans decide for themselves whether Democrats’ claims of Trump’s ties to Russia are a legitimate concern or a trumped up political strategy intended solely to derail the Trump train.













Toen Brian Harrison als bewakingsagent werd aangenomen in de Alpine Bank in Rockford, Illinois, wist hij dat de kans altijd bestond dat hij geweld zou moeten gebruiken om bankovervallers af te weren. En die dag kwam toen Lawrence Turner, een gemaskerde schutter, de bank binnenstapte en geld eiste.

Omdat Turner een wapen had, schoot Harrison meteen in actie. Op de bewakingsbeelden kunnen we zien hoe de bewakingsagent de overval afhandelde. Alles ontvouwt zich vliegensvlug nadat Turner op 20 januari eerst een rondje in het plafond schoot. Vervolgens richt hij zijn pistool op de kassabediendes en bedreigt hun levens. Toen Harrison dat zag gebeuren zag hij zich geen andere keuze dan het vuur op Turner te openen. Harrison doodde hen.En dan kwam de politie erbij …Omdat Harrison tijdens zijn werk een man had gedood, nam de wet de zaak heel ernstig. Ze openden een onderzoek om te achterhalen of de bewakingsmanier wel op de juiste manier gehandeld had. En er bestond geen garantie dat dit het geval was …Nadat de getuigen ondervraagd waren en men de beelden bekeken had, had de wet zijn oordeel klaar. En met een eenvoudig woord bepaalden ze de toekomst van Harrison. Als het als een misdrijf beschouwd zou worden, riskeerde hij jaren gevangenisstraf. In het andere geval zou hij een held zijn.Dinsdag noemde Joe Bruscato, de openbare aanklager in de zaak, Harrison een hel. Volgens de wet had de bewakingsagent uit zelfverdediging gehandeld! Hij zei: “Er bestaat geen twijfel over dat de handelingen van Brian Harrison het leven van de werknemers gered hebben en zo ook zijn eigen leven redde.”Als je het niet gelooft moet je de beelden hieronder maar zelf bekijken.

The 2016 election is finally over, and while the results have shown Donald Trump as the winner, Hillary Clinton isn’t the only loser.The mainstream media proved its competency when, after months of championing Clinton and focusing on Trump, they were baffled as Trump went on to win the presidency.The Democratic National Committee worked to rig their primary in favor of Hillary Clinton, while ignoring the massive following established by her opponent, Bernie Sanders.Saudi Arabia, George Soros and all of the other Clinton donors who spent millions in an attempt to prop up her campaign. This election served as a reminder that even if a campaign is incredibly well funded, it still does not determine the ultimate success of the candidate.Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson finally had a chance to put Third Parties on the map in a year when the two major candidates were the two most unpopular candidates in history. Instead of taking advantage of this election, Johnson came off as unprepared and inexperienced, and he ultimately abandoned the platform of the party that nominated him.

Makia Freeman, Contributor
Waking TimesWilliam Tompkins is one of the most incredible whistleblowers to step forward. The depth and implications of his testimony are nothing short of astounding. Of course, there will always be those who refuse to believe his story, since he is an ET (Extraterrestrial) whistleblower. Tompkins claims he was part of an operation involving US Navy spies who stole UFO plans and antigravity technological secrets from the Nazis during the height of World War 2. He asserts he personally distributed some of these stolen secrets as information packages to the CEOs of leading American corporations involved in the military and space industries. Furthermore, William Tompkins says he actually worked alongside ETs – Nordic alien women who looked indistinguishable from humans and who were working as his secretaries. Additionally, he reveals that the Nazis already had operational UFOs during the war, and because of the information that the US spies were able to obtain, the US later developed its own fleet of UFOs – which then got siphoned off into the black military sphere under the control of MJ 12 (aka MJ-12 or Majestic 12), the ultra secretive group that came into existence in the 1940s to “manage” the UFO/alien issue.Maria Orsic of the Thule Society.To understand this tale and put it in historical context, we have to go all the way back to before World War 2 began. You may have heard of Secret Societies that were in existence around the time of the rise of Hitler and the Nazis, such as the Thule Society and the Vril Society. An extremely talented young woman, Maria Orsic, managed to make contact with alien civilizations and channel information from them. It is widely reported that one of these civilizations was from the planet Aldebaran, which is located is the Taurus system. According to Tompkins, the Nazis were in contact with Extraterrestrial Reptilians at the same time as Orsic was doing her channeling. Hitler found out about Orsic, her abilities and the fact she was receiving information that detailed how to construct UFOs. Again, according to Tompkins, Hitler allowed Orsic (and the Nordics with whom she was working) to continue work on their UFO program, because the Nazis were already in contact with the Reptilians – and because Hitler knew he could always come in take over Orsic’s project at any time.Robert Wood, who was interviewed alongside William Tompkins by Search4TruthReality (part 1, part 2 and part 3), claims that the Nazis’ technology rapidly advanced due to their relationship with the Reptilians, such that they actually got to far side of the moon before end of WW2. Wood is a veteran expert in the UFO field himself, having been given the task early in his career (when he was working at Douglas) to analyze how UFOs worked. He was given $500,000 to disseminate UFO documents and $250,000 to make a UFO documentary. Later, Robert and his son Ryan scanned hundreds of MJ 12 documents and made them available on their website MajesticDocuments.com.

		Now, fast forward to 1942, where the tale begins for Tompkins. The world is exactly in the middle of World War 2. The 2 brutal dictators Hitler and Stalin are commanding armies engaged in long battles with high fatalities on both sides. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to almost the entire world population except for a few insiders, the Nazis are deep into a secret UFO project. Having obtained plans and schematics from a group of female channelers (one of whom was named Maria Orsic), the Nazis already have operational UFO craft, such as the Haunebu (top image).During all of this, almost on the other side of the world to Moscow, on February 24-25, 1942, UFOs fly over the LA sky for hours. Tompkins, who is still a boy in high school, watches the UFOs all night. The incident later becomes known as the infamous Battle of Los Angeles. Several weeks later he is pulled out of high school to work in the military, and his life takes on a whole new direction.Close up shot of UFO in the Battle of Los Angeles, Feb. 24-25th, 1942.According to William Tompkins himself, he was recruited at a young age by the Navy due to his precocious ability to build highly accurate model ships. After working at North American Aviation and Northrop, he was hired by Douglas Aircraft Company in 1950. There he worked as a draftsman under a group partly controlled by Navy personnel who used to work for James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy from 1944-1947 and Secretary of Defense from 1947-1949, a man who also took JFK under his wing and who may have been responsible for JFK’s later interest in UFOs. Forrestal was said to have jumped or fallen out of a high window and thus died in suspicious circumstances. It appears he knew too much and had to be eliminated because he went against the prevailing NWO agenda of secrecy regarding the alien issue. Apparently, Forrestal was an ET contactee. Forrestal chose Admiral Rico Botta, who in turn chose William Tompkins. It seems both Forrestal and Botta were guided to choose someone under them who was open to the extraterrestrial reality, someone who could handle the (colossal) truth. (For more on Rico Botta see this article.)JFK, left, with Curtis LeMay, right. LeMay was another one of those aggressive generals who disliked Kennedy. Image credit: APIn interviews such as with Project Camelot (part 1 and part 2) and in his book Selected by Extraterrestrials, Tompkins reveals much of his story. He explains how the ultra secretive group MJ 12 began – not in 1947 after Roswell as many imagine. Tompkins explains it actually began in 1942 with the senior Douglas (the man who started the company Douglas). Tompkins states that right after Battle of LA in 1942, in order to handle the implications of UFOs openly showing themselves in the skies, that Douglas pulled some key men into a group (or think tank) which later became MJ 12. The group included 2 admirals and 2 generals, one of whom was Curtis LeMay – another man who disliked JFK and who, during the Cold War, was prepared to launch a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Robert Wood states that MJ 12 is mostly associated mostly with Air Force, not other branches of the US military.During WW2, US Navy operatives were embedded inside the Nazi military. They were able to get data (including pictures) of the Nazi UFOs and relay the information back to the US. Tompkins explains how the information went through his superior, Rico Botta, who chose an ingenious way to handle the subject: by not classifying it all. If he had given it top secret classification or another high classification, it may have attracted unwanted attention. So, he chose to not classify it at all! This is the technique known as hiding the truth in plain sight.Tompkins was assigned the job of handing out packages containing this information to the CEOs and leaders of private military corporations. Unfortunately, the packets didn’t contain good schematics or drawings of the Nazi technology, but were rather like chicken scratch with very little technical information. They even contained hieroglyphics (not the German language) since the operatives accessed the actual channeled information that had come via Maria Orsic!According to Wood, the US Navy started back engineering UFO craft in 1942 (with permission from Forrestal) before MJ 12 came into existence. It took the Navy around a decade to produce functional UFO craft, but they did so eventually. Tompkins went on to join TRW, an important space think tank which was formed around 1958-59 according to him. It also came out of a Douglas think tank (just as MJ 12 had). It had unlimited funds. Northrup borrowed money and bought TRW. They also bought the US Navy’s ship building company that builds aircraft carriers – so they could take their engineers to crawl all over 790ft aircraft carriers so they could design a 1km space craft carrier.In various interviews such as with Jeff Rense, Tompkins puts forth his theory that our moon is not a natural object but rather an artificial object and command center. This aligns with what other researchers such as David Icke have warned about. Our moon doesn’t rotate, and neither do other moons of other planets. Conventional physics explains this is because of a tidal lock, but is it perhaps because these artificial objects are hiding something on their dark sides facing away from their host planet?Tompkins states that when the first astronauts went to the moon, they were shocked to discover it was already occupied – by Draco Reptilians. He says the Reptilians, over 9 foot tall, were standing there next to their advanced craft. He jokes that the Reptilians “gave us the finger” (i.e. acted in an unfriendly manner). According to both Tompkins and Wood, the Reptilians had already made a deal with the Nazis.Amazingly, Tompkins himself claims he saw ancient structures on the far side of the moon and that he saw a floating building – 1.5 miles above the lunar surface!For Tompkins, the entire Apollo 11 mission was a show. All the astronauts were Freemasons. He states that Freemasons put the plaque on the moon first, then got back in the module to do the “Neil Armstrong” show. Perhaps Armstrong should have said: “One small step for Man, one giant leap for Masonry.”Finally, Tompkins goes deep into the conspiracy by saying that ultimately we don’t own our planet; it is a laboratory for advanced ETs to conduct experiments upon us.Another US military patch featuring the reptile theme and a Latin motto. Rough translation: “With all your bases, you’re a slave to us.”Tompkins states that although there are many ET species interacting with humanity right now, including Dracos/Reptilians which influence some groups and Nordics which influence other groups, that Reptilians basically control every government in the world. In his Project Camelot interview, Tompkins warns that if he talks about Reptilians and their darkest activities – which include eating humans and performing blood sacrifices – then some people will think it is so crazy that they will automatically shut down and discredit everything else he has said. Kerry Cassidy reiterates the philosophy of Project Camelot: that humans in general are not protecting themselves and are ignorant of the dangers of predatory ET species, and that therefore it is vital that those in the know go public with their knowledge and warn others – because not to do so equates to culpability. For what it’s worth, Tompkins also offer his opinion that all recent US Presidents (including Obama) have been Reptilians who could change their form – but that Donald Trump is not one of them.Nordic mind control may explain why Tompkins and why now. Tompkins tells a story in his Project Camelot interview that he come up with alternate design for the Apollo missions, and was able to present it to the top dogs as NASA, Werner von Braun and Kurt Debus. He got a large model and had to drive it (in the back of a truck) onto a highly guarded military base. Somehow, he got through with no papers and no need to show security guards anything. They even had a dolly right nearby to load and carry the model! Tompkins believes the Nordics have been helping him all along by clearing the way for him to do certain things.So why William Tompkins? He thinks he is being given the green light, while others like him are being threatened or having their families threatened. He thinks it is because of his association with Nordic ETs, specifically 2 women and 1 man who used to be his secretaries. As an aside, he did not know for a long time that he even had ETs working for him. He only found this out when one day one of them fell down the stairs and was taken to hospital in a grave condition. He overheard her admitting she was not who she said she was and answering to another boss or captain.William Tompkins likes to say throughout his interviews that “everything you’re told is a lie”. He claims that many of the systems and sciences we pursue, such as astronomy, medicine, etc., have been seeded with lies to trick us. This harks back to his claim that every government on Earth right now is under Reptilian control. Whether that turns out to be true or not remains to be seen, but certainly, so much deception has already been uncovered in so many areas of life that it is wisest to remain open to this possibility.Tompkins’ tale reaffirms that the extraordinary story of humanity, and the depth of the worldwide conspiracy, cannot possibly be grasped without comprehending the reality of ET interference in our past and current ET influence and control over our affairs.Thank you William Tompkins for bravely coming forward with your story and knowledge.Makia Freeman is the editor of The Freedom Articles and senior researcher at ToolsForFreedom.com (FaceBook here), writing on many aspects of truth and freedom, from exposing aspects of the worldwide conspiracy to suggesting solutions for how humanity can create a new system of peace and abundance**Sources embedded throughout article.This article (The Whistleblower Who Exposes Government Extraterrestrial Connections) was originally created and published by The Freedom Articles and is re-posted here with permission. ~~ Help Waking Times to raise the vibration by sharing this article with friends and family…








We are living in an interesting but by no means unique dynamic in which the solutions to problems such as slow growth and inequality have become the problems. This is a dynamic I have often discussed in various contexts. In essence, a solution that was optimized for an earlier era and situation is repeatedly applied to the present–but the present is unlike the past, and the old solution is no longer optimized to current conditions.The old solution isn’t just a less-than-optimal solution; it actively makes the problem worse.As a result, the old solution becomes a new problem that only exacerbates the current difficulties. The status quo strategy is not to question the efficacy of the old solution–it is to apply the old solution in heavier and heavier doses, on the theory that if only we increase the dose, it will finally resolve the problem.Take borrowing from the future, i.e. debt, as a prime example of this dynamic.Back when credit was scarce and expensive, unleashing a tsunami of cheap, abundant credit supercharged growth by enabling millions of people who previously had limited access to credit to suddenly borrow and spend enormous sums of cash.This tsunami of new spending supercharged growth such that servicing the debt was easy, as incomes and wealth both expanded far beyond the cost of the new debt.
Fast-forward to today, and adding 50% of the nation’s GDP in new federal debt ($9 trillion) and trillions more in corporate and houshold debt in the past 8 years has yielded subpar growth–roughly 2% a year.This poor response to massive floods of credit, borrowing and spending has flummoxed conventional economists, who incorrectly assumed old solutions would always work as they had in the past.In a similar fashion, conventional economists expected fiscal stimulus to boost growth. Fiscal stimulus–one-time tax refunds, infrastructure spending, tax cuts and various forms of “helicopter money”–central banks creating money out of thin air for the government to spend or distribute–have all failed to generate the self-sustaining virtuous cycle of boosting the output of the engines of income/wealth creation.As I noted in Fragmentation and the De-Optimization of Centralization (January 2, 2017), The 4th Industrial Revolution has de-optimized centralization. Centralized control, power and money are now the problem, not the solution.In the past, centralizing control of industries, credit and production increased the productivity of the whole economy. But that was then, and this is now. In the current era, centralization only breeds corruption, moral hazard, revolving doors between state agencies and private industry, opaque, rigged markets, rentier cartel parasitism and state-cartel crony capitalism, in which the central state regulates industries like Big Pharma, defense weaponry, higher education and so on to benefit entrenched interests, elites and cartels.Regulations have also slipped from being solutions to problems. Everyone weighing the costs and benefits agrees that building and zoning codes enacted at the turn of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century greatly reduced the health hazards posed by slums and unregulated industries. Everyone weighing the costs and benefits agrees that clean air and water regulations imposed in the early 1970s benefited the public and the nation, despite the higher costs for goods and services that industry passed down to the consumer.Technological improvements and efficiencies offset much or all of these costs by the 1980s, and by the 1990s, technological gains were increasing the income and wealth of almost every participant in the economy.Recently, these technological gains have become concentrated in the top 5% of wage-earners and the owners of the capital. There are several drivers for this, including proximity to cheap credit, tax evasion techniques available only to corporations and the wealthy, pay-to-play lobbying for tax breaks and regulatory barriers to competition, and so on–all the foul fruits of centralized power and the crony-capitalism it breeds.But technology is also exacerbating the trend to a winner-take-all or winners-take-most asymmetry between the most profitable and productive and “everyone else.”Regulations have now become burdens rather than low-cost means of improving the commons shared by all. Advocates for “tiny houses” and similar solutions to homelessness run into buzz-saws of regulations that prohibit such construction and zoning, and advocates of innovations from urban farming to crypto-currencies find regulations (often serving the interests of political donors rather than the public) are stifling innovations and efficiencies that would benefit the many rather than the few.The regulatory agencies are prone to self-serving complexity that justified their budgets and power; as the regulations become more voluminous and arcane, “experts” in reading the runes and keeping up to date justify their big salaries and departmental budget.The Lifecycle of Bureaucracy (December 2, 2010)As I explain in my book Resistance, Revolution, Liberation: A Model for Positive Change, the state only knows how to expand; there is no mechanism, no institutional memory and no reward motivation to reduce the size of state power or revenues, or reduce the reach of the regulations and laws that empower the state to control virtually every aspect of life.There are many other “solutions” that no longer solve their intended target problem but have become burdensome problems in themselves. One need only look at healthcare, higher education and weaponry acquisition programs to find hundreds of examples of perverse incentives and unintended consequences that are the direct result of anti-competitive, intentionally opaque, centralized regulations that are implicitly designed to benefit the few (wealthy political donors, lobbyists and entrenched interests) at the expense of the many who are shut out of the regulatory game.Student loans are an excellent example of a “solution” becoming a problem itself, while the underlying problem–soaring costs for diminishing-return diplomas–rages on, enabled by the “solution”: force student debt-serfs to borrow another trillion dollars to fund sclerotic, self-serving bloated bureaucracies.The Nearly Free University and the Emerging Economy: The Revolution in Higher Education.Borrowing and spending $9 trillion did little but indenture future taxpayers to pay for for our massive malinvestment in diminishing-returns dead-ends.If we look at yesterday’s chart of overlapping crises, we note each crisis began as a purported “solution.” The “solutions” are: more debt (now a problem); more centralization (now a problem); financialization (now a problem); promising more benefits to everyone (now a problem), and so on.Real solutions are optimized for the 4th Industrial Revolution and the emerging economy, not the economy of 1946. These solutions are the opposite of all the institutional-state-cartel “solutions”: decentralize power and control, transparency rather than self-serving obfuscation; empowerment of communities rather than centralized agencies and cartels, and embracing disruptive technologies–technologies that disrupt existing rentier skims, cartel rackets, regulatory barriers, etc.The cold truth is all these institutional-state-cartel “solutions” serve the few at the expense of the many. This is not a side-effect; it is the intended output of these “solutions.” In other words, these “solutions” work great for the parasitic few at the top skimming all the wealth, power and income, at the expense of the exploited many and the stability of the system as a whole.Those benefiting from these destructive “solutions” may think the system can go on forever, but it cannot go on when every “solution” becomes a self-reinforcing problem that amplifies all the other systemic problems.Recent podcasts/video programs:Keiser Report: Jon Corzine’s Big, Bad Bond Bet (25:43 min., 2nd half)Self-Employment & Financial Bubbles (1:26 hrs)Charles Hugh Smith On Inequalities And The Distortions Caused By Central Bank Policies (30 min.)Rogue Money (56:59 min.)

	March 29, 2017 - BREAKING NEWS, LOCAL NEWSWATERFORD plumbing and heating nixerologist Martin Fennell has made assurances to a worried client that he’ll be around later today to finish the work he started on her bathroom, failing that he’ll be around tomorrow or maybe later in the week, it’s just hard to say at this stage.Fennell began the renovation work for Maura McGahon earlier this week, before leaving the job unfinished at four o’clock in the afternoon with no explanation, never to be seen again.Calls by Mrs. McGahon to the 27-year-old handyman have sought clarity as to why he walked away leaving her literally without a pot to piss in, but as yet Fennell has not clarified anything except ‘he needed bits’.With hours turning into days and days threatening to turn into weeks, Fennell eased Mrs. McGahon’s worries by assuring her that the job would definitely get finished, although he failed to nail down roughly when that would happen.“2017 is wide open,” said Fennell over the phone, as he ate a sandwich in his van.“Are you going anywhere for holidays in the summer? If so, leave me a key and I’ll tip in and see what I can do. Or winter? before Christmas, I promise. I just needed a thing for the back of the yoke, and the shop didn’t have one so they had to send away and sure you know yourself, I was away on another job by then but I promise, this evening I’ll be around”.“Or next year. One or the other. You can count on it”.Tags: instantOur website uses cookies, as almost all websites do, to help provide you with the best experience we can.

Do you feel stuck in a particular area of your life?  Do you feel stagnant in your relationships, business, or personal well being?  What part of your personality is holding you back and preventing you from taking your life to the next level?  What are you willing to do to achieve that break through that always seems to elude you?Albert Einstein stated that “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results”.  In other words, If you continue to do the same thing today as you did yesterday, why would you expect tomorrow to be any different?Indeed there is power in remaining consistent when performing particular actions.  For instance, by reading every day one can amass a great amount of knowledge over an extended period of time; by eating well and exercising regularly one can maintain a physically healthy lifestyle; by investing $50/week with the right interest rates one can create signifiant wealth over 20-30 years.Clearly behaving with consistency under certain conditions has much to offer an individual.  So what is it that Albert Einstein meant when attempting to convey to us the “danger” of doing the same thing everyday?  What types of repetitive behaviors should we remove from our daily routines?If you are lazy and unwilling to work, the chances of your career blossoming will be bordering on non-existent.  If you are unkind and inconsiderate to others the likelihood of you making new friends will be considerably low.  But is this not well known to the common individual?  Is this really what Albert Einstein meant to instill within us: the superfluous concept that repeating negative behavior will never produce positive results?I perceive Einstein warning us of the inevitable consequences of complacency and highlighting “comfortability” as one of the most common ingredients that spoils our ability to manifest our potential.  After all, what is done routinely often times loses flavor due to its monotony.New levels of achievement and advancement are not experienced by those who are unwilling to stretch themselves beyond their breaking point.  When Albert Einstein urges us to not do the same thing today as we did yesterday, I do not believe he is referring to the specific acts we are engaged in; but rather to the way in which we engage in our actions.When I started my life coaching and motivational speaking company over a year ago I was petrified; I was uncertain what I should teach, who I could reach, and how I could reach them.  I began by speaking in two drug treatment centers per week and within 6 months had quickly grown to over 10 per week.  But something happened over the next 6 months.I began to feel very comfortable speaking in treatment centers.  It became easier and easier the more experience I obtained.  I began to feel as if I had reached a plateau and progress felt out of reach.  I reached out to a mentor of mine who reminded me about the importance of constantly trying new things and getting out of my “comfort zone”.The next day I “hit the pavement” and began promoting myself to high schools.  I entered into a new arena where I had no contacts and connections and was uncertain of how they would respond to my pitch.  Within one week I had booked my first gig which quickly gave birth to a second.  As I am writing this to you, several more opportunities are opening up.I do not know what the future of my company will be, but I do know that it will become what I will make it.  The secret of achieving greater levels of success is completely dependent upon my ability to consistently “get outside the box” and break free from my comfort zone.If you have a desire to create a break through in a particular area of your life start by asking yourself these questions:Where have I created a “comfort zone” in my life?  Where have I fallen into the clutches of complacency?  How can I free myself from it’s grip?Complacency will forever be the antithesis for further growth, transformation, and success.  If you authentically desire to create new levels of achievement in your life it is essential to constantly explore the territory of the unknown.Read between the lines of Albert Einstein’s message and expand your horizons each and every day.  Be cautious of getting too comfortable; do not allow complacency to take control of your life and prevent you from making progress; try new things every day and approach every waking moment with passion.Share:Rate:

I know we have experienced a lot of eclipses before, but this one is definitely something you should look out for in the next 10 months.Why? Because 10 months from now, there’s a big possibility that we will witness a total visible eclipse!Oops, wait. Don’t panic because there really is no need to panic. The Sun will vanish for about two and a half minutes.Interesting isn’t it? If you want to know more about this total visible eclipse, check out the information below.According to Michael E Bakich, Senior Editor at Astronomy magazine, Aug. 21, 2017, “may turn out to be the most popular vacation-day request in history.” But why?On that date, for the first time in almost a century, the United States will witness a total eclipse of the Sun. The Sun will vanish for about two and a half minutes, commencing in Oregon around 10:15 a.m. local time, then moving eastward, finishing its astonishing show an hour and a half later in South Carolina. And in between, the phenomenon will be visible from Grand Teton and the Great Smoky Mountains national parks, from St. Louis and Kansas City and Charleston, S.C., and the many points in between.A solar eclipse occurs when the moon positions itself directly in front of the sun, completely covering it for a brief period of time. The entire sky then darkens, allowing you to look right at the Sun (or with solar viewing glasses if it is not completely covered). Viewers witness an astounding corona encircling the Sun, stars shining bright, the horizon glowing with a 360-degree sunset, a drop in temperatures, and, ultimately, the odd reality of day unexpectedly turning off its lights and momentarily becoming night.If you’re already marking your calendars, you might also want to grab yourself a map to find a spot where the eclipse will be total. But mind you, hotels, lodges, and campgrounds along the 50-to-70-mile-wide path of “totality” have already been booking up since May, simply because it’s the type of rare event one may only see just once in their lifetime, if at all.In fact, the last time a total eclipse was visible coast to coast was June 8, 1918. The event made front-page news nationwide. And if we’re given this many months in advance to get it together, it must mean the eclipse is worth calling out of work for, turning off the TV for, and putting down your iPhone for, and simply observing something so magically awe-inspiring, that, in our day and age with our over-stimulated brains, actually captures our attention for more than 30 seconds and holds us present in the moment.“Everyone who sees a total solar eclipse remembers it forever,” said Norm Sperling in the August 1980 issue of Astronomy magazine. “It overwhelms the senses, and the soul as well — the curdling doom of the onrushing umbra, the otherworldly pink prominences, and the ethereal pearly corona. And incredibly soon, totality terminates.“Then it hits you: ‘It was supposed to last a few minutes — but that couldn’t have been true. It only seemed to last eight seconds!’”Bakich notes in “25 tips to plan for the 2017 eclipse” that if you want to see it, you need to plan accordingly, or you’re likely to miss out. And along with ditching work, Bakich also suggests the following:We are always grateful for your courage and inspiration to read and watch our posts.

"... casual and repeated violations ..."by Jack Davis March 30, 2017 at 7:37amAdvertisement - story continues belowThe Hillary Clinton campaign is over, but the campaign to learn what went on during Clinton’s State Department’s era is not.On Thursday, the watchdog group Judicial Watch released almost 1,200 pages of State Department records including 29 newly discovered emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that were sent through unsecured email accounts.Judicial Watch had filed a Freedom of Information request seeking “emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin” using a private address.Advertisement - story continues belowThe emails disclose “additional instances of Abedin and Hillary Clinton sending classified information through unsecured email accounts and contributors being given special access to the former secretary of state,” according to a Judicial Watch press release.“These emails are yet more evidence of Hillary Clinton’s casual and repeated violations of laws relating to the handling of classified information,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The Justice Department should finally begin an independent investigation into the Clinton email matter.”The Judicial Watch release said the 29 previously undisclosed emails it released appear to contradict statements made by Clinton that all of the emails she knew of were turned over to the State Department when her use of a private server for her official email was first disclosed.Advertisement - story continues belowThe emails released by Judicial Watch include information from Jake Sullivan, then-Deputy Chief of Staff, that informed Clinton and Abedin about “former GTMO [Guantanamo] detainee Binyam Mohamed” and his request for “various classified intelligence documents” about his detention before he was taken to Gitmo.The Judicial Watch’s release of data also included two April 2010 emails from Clinton confidante Sydney Blumenthal which have since been rated as classified. The information, which Clinton asked Abedin to print for her, concerned the Kyrgyz Republic.The batch of emails also includes a request from Clinton Foundation official Douglas Band to Abedin seeking to address requests for assistance from Philip Levine, described by Judicial Watch in its release as “a fundraiser for the Clintons since the 1990s.”The emails also reveal that Abedin was involved in planning the funerals for Hillary and former President Bill Clinton.Advertisement - story continues belowCapricia Martin, the State Department’s chief protocol officer, had initiated an exchange with Abedin about the Clintons’ funeral arrangements.“Planning is necessary and best done when they are still with us,” she wrote.“As well, Huma, I would make the same suggestion to you — for her it will be a little different … And once affirmed it will be very hard for someone to deny the type of ceremony she wanted — as well I understand that the President can request certain arrangements for her that she/her rep cannot (ie if you want the motorcade to go through DC — stop somewhere),” Marshall added.Those emails were sent around the same time as Bill Clinton’s February 2010 heart surgery.What do you think?

Government claims it is cracking down on 'extremism' but human rights groups say religious freedom under attackChina has banned burqas, veils and “abnormal” beards in a predominantly Muslim province in what it claims is a crackdown on religious extremism.The measures, which also force people to watch state television, follow decades of ethnic and religious discrimination against Xinjiang’s 10 million-strong ethic Uyghur population.New regulations, to come into force on Saturday, require government workers in airports, railway stations and other public places “dissuade” women who fully cover their faces and bodies from entering and report them to police.They also prohibit the “abnormal growing of beards and naming of children to exaggerate religious fervour”, without giving specifics.It will be forbidden to “reject or refuse radio, television and other public facilities and services”, marrying using religious rather than legal procedures and “using the name of Halal to meddle in the secular life of others”.Rules published in state-controlled media continue: “Parents should use good moral conduct to influence their children, educate them to revere science, pursue culture, uphold ethnic unity and refuse and oppose extremism.”The document also bans not allowing children to attend regular school, not abiding by family planning policies and deliberately damaging legal documents.Successive bans on select "extremist behaviours" have previously been introduced in in areas of Xinjiang, including stopping people with headscarves, veils and long beards from boarding buses in at least one city.Escalating crackdown against human rights activists including mass arrests of lawyers and a series of sweeping laws in the name of ‘national security’.Getty ImagesThe arrest of thousands, including peaceful critics, in a ruthless crackdown in the name of national security, the prolonged detention of hundreds without charge or trial and the sentencing of hundreds of others to death.Getty ImagesTorture, enforced disappearances and the criminalisation of LGBTI people;

437 Views The Holocaust survivor and Nobel peace laureate Elie Wiesel has died aged 87 at his home in Manhattan.His friend Menachem Rosensaft and Israeli Yad Veshem research centerconfirmed the death on Saturday. “Yad Vashem mourns the passing of Elie Wiesel-Holocaust survivor, Nobel laureate, renowned author,” the center said in a statement.“There were so many dimensions to this unique, truly extraordinary individual,” wrote Rosensaft, general counsel of the World Jewish Congress, in a tributepublished by Tablet magazine on Saturday.Rosensaft remembered Wiesel as passionate and curious, intellectual and spiritual – an indefatigable crusader for conscience and learning.“He abhorred bigotry of any kind, against Jews certainly, but with equal fervor if it was directed at any other group,” Rosensaft wrote. “He neither flaunted his Jewishness nor presumed to impose it on others. Rather he sought to explain its mysteries and to convey his love of the Jewish religion, of Jewish culture and tradition, of Jewish mysticism and Jewish mysteries.”Born in Sighet, Romania on 30 September 1928, Wiesel became best known forhis book Night, which drew on his experiences in Nazi concentration camps during the final years of the second world war. Barely a teenager when Hungary annexed his town and forced its Jewish people into ghettos in 1940, Wiesel was then sent with his father to the concentration camp at Auschwitz, Poland.His mother and sister were killed in gas chambers. After a forced march to Buchenwald, his father, already suffering from dysentery, was killed by an SS officer’s beating.Freed from the camp at 16, Wiesel moved to France with other Jewish survivors and became a journalist for French and Israeli papers in the late 1940s. He moved to the US in 1955 and became a US citizen in 1963. In the late 1950s he completed Night, which was translated into English in 1960. The book, which was turned down by more than a dozen publishers, became a perennial bestseller, selling an estimated 10m copies.Wiesel completed more than 40 other books, including Dawn and Day, which also addressed the Holocaust. He married Marion Rose, another survivor, in Jerusalem in 1969, and wrote and lectured at universities including Yale, Columbia, Boston University and City University of New York.In 1978, President Jimmy Carter named Wiesel to the commission that created Washington DC’s Holocaust Museum, whose entrance bears his words: “For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.”In 1985 Carter’s successor, Ronald Reagan, awarded Wiesel the congressional gold medal at the White House, where Wiesel denounced the president’s plan to visit a German cemetery holding the bodies of Nazi officers.“That place, Mr President, is not your place,” Wiesel told him. “Your place is with the victims of the SS.”Wiesel confronted another president, telling Bill Clinton in 1993: “I cannot sleep for what I have seen” in the former Yugoslavia.“As a Jew I am saying that we must do something to stop the bloodshed in that country!” he said. “People fight each other and children die. Why? Something, anything must be done.”In 1986, the Nobel committee called Wiesel “a messenger to mankind”. He accepted the peace prize with characteristic grace.“I have tried to keep memory alive, that I have tried to fight those who would forget,” he said in his acceptance speech, “because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices.“We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.“When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must – at that moment – become the center of the universe.”Wiesel was given an honorary knighthood by Britain, granted the rank of Grand-Croix in France’s Legion of Honor, and awarded the Israeli president’s medal of distinction.In 2012 he returned a medal to Hungary, in protest against what he called the government’s “whitewashing of tragic and criminal episodes in Hungary’s past, namely the wartime Hungarian government’s involvement in the deportation and murder of hundreds of thousands of its Jewish citizens”.In the 2000s he continued his advocacy work, joining the actor George Clooney at the United Nations to speak about Darfur, signing a 2006 open letter with other Nobel laureates to denounce denial of the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman empire, and continuing to speak out about repression in South Africa, Bosnia, Argentina and other countries.He often returned to the theme of remembrance, travelling with Barack Obama and Angela Merkel to Auschwitz in 2009.Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, called Wiesel a “master of words” in a statement released Saturday. “In the darkness of the Holocaust, Elie became a powerful force for light, truth and dignity. His life and work were a great blessing to the Jewish people, the Jewish state and to all humanity,” Netanyahu said. “I feel fortunate to have known him and to have learned from his prodigious wisdom.”Wiesel is survived by his wife, a son, a stepdaughter and two grandchildren.








According to witnesses, the 51 year old man who lives on welfare, was expelled from the restaurant after he then spent more than 7 hours on-site, ingesting a quantity of food which has been estimated between 50 and 70 pounds.Despite the fact that the restaurant advertised the buffet as “all-you-can-eat”, the manager of the establishment seems to have  lost patience at some point, telling him that his meal would be free but asking him to leave. The manager’s intervention angered Mr Fleming, and  a brief altercation took place before he was finally pushed out of the restaurant.He immediately called the police and filed a complaint against the restaurant, and he intends to make the people responsible for his mistreatment, pay for their actions.“It’s a serious injustice, and I am deeply insulted!” Mr. Flemmings told reporters. “With my income, I rarely go to the restaurant, so I try to get as much as I can for my money when I do. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. Not only did they kick me out while I was still hungry, but they looked at me like I was disgusting, like I was not worthy of eating there! It’s unacceptable, and I demand a compensation!”Mr Flemming says the employee of the Golden Corral did not use any insulting language, but he claims that the disgust that was visible on their faces has left him with some deep emotional wounds.The direction of the restaurant chain quickly issued a press release announcing that the decision to expel Mr. Flemmings was a regrettable personal initiative from an overzealous franchise manager. They also said that some financial indemnities had been offered to compensate the damage suffered by the victim, but had been refused.Mr Flemmings confirmed that he had been offered a significant amount of money by the company, but he is convinced that he can get more if he goes to court.The primary hearing in this case should take place on March 7, at the Springfield District Court.

Prime Minister David Cameron is to step down by October after the UK voted to leave the European Union. Mr Cameron made the announcement in a statement outside Downing Street after the final result was announced. He said he would attempt to “steady the ship” over the coming weeks and months but that “fresh leadership” was needed.
The PM had urged the country to vote Remain, warning of economic and security consequences of an exit, but the UK voted to Leave by 52% to 48%.
					
		        
			            
			            	
			            
			             










Posted on March 30, 2017  by World Wide Healthy  in Health | 0 CommentsThere are significant challenges when it comes to maintaining the health of the spine.
The spinal cord which runs from top to bottom of the spinal column receives little stimulation in normal standing, sitting, walking or running. Yet when it experiences the swim-like flexing of the spine that happens naturally when the pelvis moves from side to side, it is apparent this stimulation has a big effect on respiration and circulation.One of the first Japanese healthcare practitioners to popularize the many health benefits of this sideways swimming motion in the pelvic region was Seigo Nishi. He created the term “Goldfish Exercise” and taught it as part of his Nishi-shiki approach to self-help healthcare as early as 1927. This exercise has been nicknamed “The Goldfish” because of the similarity to the body moving like a swimming goldfish. This exhilarating exercise helps the spine straighten and positions the nerves so that pressure is relieved. In addition, the Goldfish exercise assists in regulating physiological functions in the organs and nervous system. It also improves blood supply and circulation which improves function in major organs such as the intestines, liver, kidneys, heart, brain and skin.

If you can’t, there’s always a couple of shitholes away from the strip that’ll serve pretty much anyone.”Subscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.Thank you for subscribing.Something went wrong.We respect your privacy and take protecting it seriously

A top Canadian nuclear physicist has gone on the record and admitted that aliens visit Earth “on a regular basis.” According to Stanton Friedman, Earth has been visited on numerous occasions by extraterrestrials, who aim to one day quarantine us on our planet.The 82-year-old scientist claims that evidence proving the existence of aliens has been deliberately kept from us by our own governments, as part of a “truth embargo.”Speaking to the Daily Star, he said: “We have enough to prove without a shadow of a doubt that planet Earth is being visited [by aliens].”“This is kept from people because who would want the world in upheaval? There would be mass panic and distress.”“If they (the aliens) want to make themselves known, it’s easy – they will.”Express.co.uk reports:He said recently declassified CIA files on UFO sightings were all part of the proof.So why does he say they are here?Mr Friedman says aliens actually want to prevent humans colonising space and will ultimately quarantine us here for the greater good to prevent mankind travelling.He said: “I think they are here. I think they are here to quarantine us, keep us from going out there.“With our track record – we’re evil.”But Mr Friedman claims our governments are trying to take advanatage of aliens being here by obtaining their technology to achieve world supremacy.He said: “The first country to replicate [alien] technology will rule the roost if they can build it.“It’s political too – the US says ‘are we ready to put out anything if the Russians don’t or the Chinese don’t’.”Mr Friedman, who has written extensively on Aliens and UFOS, has described this culture of secrecy as the world’s “Cosmic Watergate” – a reference to the President Nixon cover-up scandal in the 1970s.He now tours the globe giving talks on his beliefs at universities and conferences.Some sceptics are not convinced by his arguments, however.One poster on the forum skepticforum.com wrote: “Recently I was looking at some of Friedman’s arguments for UFO’s and against sceptics.“Overall he did a pretty poor job of battling sceptics and proving his point.“When he says he debunks the debunkers he makes sweeping generalisations and says sceptics ignore some ‘big’ cases even though many of them were looked at by sceptics.“So my question is what’s his point.“He only uses old cases that were mostly debunked and just tries to discredit sceptics rather than provide non-speculative evidence.”Possible alien structures have been spotted on NASA’s image of  the dwarf planet, Ceres. The editor of UFO Sightings Daily website, claims that more bright structures have been found on NASA’s image and that they […]Hundreds of people say they witnessed a huge UFO hovering over the city for 10 hours on Independence Day.  Witnesses feared that Earth was about to be invaded by aliens, or that government departments were experimenting […]A little talked about group of cables from Julian Assange’s Wikileaks in 2013 confirmed the existence of Extraterrestrial life.
